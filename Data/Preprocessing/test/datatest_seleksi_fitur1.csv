plot two teen couples go church party drink and then drive they get into an accident one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues see him in her life and has nightmares what is the deal watch the movie and sorta find out critique mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on very cool idea but presents it in very bad package is what makes this review an even harder one write since generally applaud films attempt break the mold mess your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just did not snag this one correctly they seem have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly so what are the problems the movie well its main problem is that it is simply too jumbled it starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in you as an audience member have no idea what is going on there are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained now personally do not mind trying unravel every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again get kind of fed up after while is this films biggest problem it is obviously got this big secret hide but it seems want hide it completely until its final five minutes and do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime not really the sad part is that the arrow and both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out the halfway point so all of the strangeness after that did start make little bit of sense but it still did not the make the all that more entertaining guess the bottom line movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password enter your world of understanding mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy okay we get it there are people chasing her and we do not know who they are do we really need see it over and over again how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie apparently the studio took this away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows there might have been pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere but guess the suits decided that turning it into music video little edge would make more sense the actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in new neighborhood but my biggest kudos go out sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling overall the does not stick because it does not entertain it is confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite pretty cool ending and explanation all of the craziness that came before it oh and the way this is not horror or teen slasher flick it is just packaged look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot the kids it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since whatever skip it where is joblo coming from nightmare of elm street blair witch the crow the crow salvation lost highway memento the others stir of echoes,0.0
the happy bastards quick movie review damn that yk bug it is got head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother william this time in story regarding crew of tugboat that comes across deserted russian tech ship that has strangeness it when they kick the power back on little do they know the power within going for the gore and bringing on few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like movie going for all flash and no substance we do not know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere we do not know the origin of what took over the ship just that big pink flashy thing hit the mir and of course we do not know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout here it is just hey let us chase these people around some robots the acting is below average even from the likes of curtis you are more likely get kick out of her work in halloween sutherland is wasted and baldwin well he is acting like baldwin of course the real star here are stan winstons robot design some schnazzy cgi and the occasional good gore shot like picking into someones brain so if robots and body parts really turn you on heres your movie otherwise it is pretty much sunken ship of movie,0.0
it is movies like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late television show the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police go undercover however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ads make it seem like so much more quick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like sounds like cool movie does it not after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete nice hair and costumes but that simply is not enough the is best described as cross between an hourlong cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half and it comes every single clich it does not really matter that the is based on television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we have already seen the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored really transfers onto the audience the only one escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even he is not enough save this convoluted mess as all the characters do not do much apart from occupying screen time the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american rating the content does not justify the is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the characters is literally spoonfed the audience would it be that hard show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the progresses you likely will not even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because you will know they are not basing the show on s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one that is missing finger or two the number of times that checked my watch six is clear indication that this is not one of them it is clear that the is nothing more than an attempt cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teenflicks that we have been seeing as of late avoid this at all costs,0.0

capsule in on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is lot of fighting and not whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct that the new comes off as his homage himself john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes for writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake make ghosts of mars is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between humans and surprisingly lowpowered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds sue this is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed fit so many pieces of his previous work into this in such an admittedly novel way but that still does not make for really good science fiction experience ghosts of mars takes place in the year mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear is good for the films budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow earthnormal again making it easier society has changed bit that time but it has advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control and from carpenters view women have really made mess of things society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in years than we might expect it change in ten the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common that of assault on precinct except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this has the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlums automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black carpenter manages give us powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing through the martian night the sound of music heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up the buildup the terror he creates looks little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove be just something boring these are standard haunted house shock effects that require no great talent give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights within short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission mars red planet and ghosts of mars after mission mars was panned too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes rate ghosts of mars on the scale and on the scale following the movie showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than did carpenters classic assault on precinct her comment is that it was seeing the same twice,0.0

janeane garofalo in romantic comedy it was good idea couple years ago the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is bythebooks movie that plods along on predestined course no surprises and very few laughs it also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages fall flat there too garofalo plays campaign aide massacusetts senator jay sanders running for reelection denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator win is play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that is made the kennedy family so popular so leary orders garofalo go ireland and dig up some relatives exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has take tiny plane ireland almost misses the bus town cannot get hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has dog piss on her luggage and so on then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds nude sean david ohara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no points for guessing it is the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight that is how it works in movies like these know from the instant saw that irishman in the bathtub that she would hate him for awhile then succumb his charms live happily for reel or so before allowing some superficial detail throw the relationship into turmoil after they would reconcile in time for happy irish tune play over the end credits have not mentioned the movies twist yet garofalo comes the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during lonely folks from around the county pair off into future of bliss milo oshea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together rest assured he will do all he can match up garofalo and ohara oh and in keeping the matchmakers utter predictability he dies toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out weak script was excited see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself the old microphones still on after he is done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better,0.0
and now the highflying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down the classics and it is not pretty this time out the nod asia goes way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer version of dumass the three musketeers bringing in popular asian actorstunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air do their fighting the end result is tepid and dull actionadventure ripoff that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay dartagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of slain musketeer he travels paris join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying overthrow the king and richelieus maninblack associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers free the musketeers wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the kings prison dartagnan and his new frisky love interestchambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured the menancing febre forcing the musketeers regroup dartagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here it is disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones jet lis high risk is ripoff of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes most asian action films carry the bulk of their production minute action sequences because they know the scenes have carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down predictable and monotonous screenplay gene quintano sudden death horrible acting stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner deliver his mousy self as leader chambers dartangnan is not musketeer he is mouseketeer and hyams use of candles and torches light the grime and filth of th century paris are wellnoted but that is the only standout in an overall flat production,0.0
a movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels first there is the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic selfdepreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for moment did not in all seriousness however and be fair the movie it is necessary provide two viewpoints that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie andor fan of the games the first movie mortal kombat concerned itself martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it is billion inhabitants the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan was poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready take over the planet as our heroes assumed fighting stance the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game would even go so far as say that many folks who did not know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they did not try overachieve there were lot of really cool fight scenes really cool accompanying music intersperesed some distracting but ultimately nonintrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as plot and as we know the movie was smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off some introductory exposition clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan has decided that he is going take over the earth anyways and hell some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately minutes of that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such success that we can get more money and make real movie now too bad they did not simply stick the formula from the first movie could write volumes about the things that are wrong this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries convince us that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of miscasting think have ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered chinese mystics generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but he is so totally wrong for this part that he does not even have the luxury of amused selfawareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has mystical hallucination and then wanders off jade irina pantaeva for these reasons and many others can only give the movie unless you are huge fan of the games andor the first movie in that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as fighter wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught her the fight choreographer hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there are not as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try hang more robust plot in between silly silly folks and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into mudwrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in both perform their animalities motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games give this you will probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one,0.0

snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing it is not just because this is brian depalma and since he is great director and one who is films are always greeted at least some fanfare and it is not even because this was starring nicolas cage and since he gives brauvara performance this is hardly worth his talents it is worse than that it is aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it the hall of fame of halfassedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighthassedness in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic rashomon where crime is told from the four different and mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this the opening might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before boxing match as he talks on his cell phone his wife interupts payperview event on tv chases down gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks his bud kevin dunne gary sinise who is character should not be confused that of actor kevin dunn who is also in this and watches as it happens there is big name in the crowd and that is the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who is sitting behind rick and who gets shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this asks and it sets this up extremely well for when rick begins question people and get different perspectives on the scene and discovers there is very good possibility it was conspiracy as we follow rick trying learn of more information we also meet woman who was talking kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in panic and tries hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and it is extremely interesting watch then it takes one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but that is not the worst part of it it is that it is the one person you did not think it would be because he was too obviously supposed be the red herring the one you did not think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person be behind it it only gets worse the turns into chase about half way through the and since we already know what happened we cannot rely on ricks investigation be all that interesting it is as if the ran out of the guts be really complex and original about third of the way in and decided just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens mean that it has become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and the end the has decided rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina that is where some outside intereference brings the sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time it is hurricane an outofcontrol police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity mysteries such as this depalma who idolizes hitchcock death has done many like this such as his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman uses movie elements uncover conspiracy piece piece but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing watch what his overthetop shot setups notably the beginning and sequence where the camera pans over top of bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries at least his direction makes up partly for it then there is koepp who showed such great ability at making characters flaws come life like he did in depalmas earlier carlitos way that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well he can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems be just halfassed effort he is flawed and we can see redemption if the story was not so formulaic scene towards the end where he has make fatal decision is cheapened the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone what the character was like this is the most disappointing kind of because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about be convinced it would be able go all the way as was watching the first half hour could not wait see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives he would be given and perhaps he would have make choice between who is he has believe now there is unfortunately the has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about half hour in when the goes into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece of crap we have seen all

forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects set in at salem massachusetts the crucible opens group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around boiling cauldron in the middle of forest under the glow of full moon they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes not be outdone in her quest regain the attention of john proctor daniel day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes chicken beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips the fresh blood taking even adolescent hormone surges into account surely this chickenbashing bit is bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibilities surely the puritan eye this is as close coven of witches as it gets the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene his screen adaptation of his play this is far from harmless event bad start an already shaky morality tale the play describes the films opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this adds the plays charged atmosphere in the the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandoras box not only is credulity stretched but abigails obsession is unfortunately spotlighted it positions the crucible more as cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts it will bring back the memory of rabbit boiling away in pot not surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail wake the following morning witches are invoked those eager blame when the girls are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied an announcement of their return god and they are thereafter converted immaculate witnesses led lustfully abigail alarming synchronicity our hormonallyadvantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents constant reminders that abigails passion sets all this into inexorable motion abigail seizes on this opportunity rid herself of her rival for john proctors love his wife elizabeth joan allen including her among those accused of witchcraft appropriately narrowwaisted and equipped distractingly white smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly murky yellow day lewis plays the dashing moral hero an overearnestness that longs be watched director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foamingmouth fervour shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on pedestal for our admiration otherwise hytners direction is unremarkable ryders performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness spare here paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character scene near the end featuring private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed unfortunately when johns audience again increases more than one his urge pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost it is clear that miller meant well but do wish he did it more delicacy and fewer diversions his screenplay is an imperfect creature the distractions coming out as loud as the message the result is clumsy muddle felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged piousness too heavyhanded be wholly believable when the gallows beckoned it was sweet release indeed far from bewitching the crucible tests the patience,0.0
one might expect cathartic viewing experience walking into new jeanluc godard after all he was founding member of the highly influential french new wave he is also an esteemed critic lending intelligence and historical perspective us in much of his writing however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating experience of the year the abstract concept on the is based had merit dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly it is edgars bruno putzulu selfappointed task capture these moments after recent breakup define central idea it is only when things are over that they make sense whether this project will end up play or opera remains undecided the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone instead what ensues is an hour and half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last only once does any character utter something worthwhile but the time it happens you are so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it but do not fret it will surface again you could easily sleep through whole sections of the as some fellow critics did and wake up in scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile but you hold hope for some time the background music keeps you in state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations it is only after repeated failures pay any of this off that you lose all hope and speeches like am thinking of something but can only think of that something when am thinking of something else how can you expect hold anyones interest godards credit he certainly knows how frame scene the black and white footage used for the first half of the is starkly beautiful watching edgar read while walking along train track on mountain makes you wish you had something ponder along him and if this had anything poignant say you would have makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities the environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them unfortunately godard also manages pillage his photographic eye randomly cutting black numerous times within any given scene sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words the second half is composed of nauseating hypercolor that often blurs the image you suddenly feel like doomed character straight out of scanners the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies steven spielberg is picked on in particular while will grant that this does happen and tend shy away from watching such garbage it is still pointless focus for that purports articulate the specific qualities of couplehood it just goes show an intelligent person is not necessarily an admirable storyteller the days of breathless are no more,0.0

reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned ehren kruger scream and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way the guy cannot seem write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule never put car thief behind the wheel create multifaceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the becomes something of punishment no reward anywhere in sight can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother cker it is almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money see his stupid movie and why the hell would anyone want invest time in movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than congratulate himself on how damn clever he is auteur theory be damned it is krugers style not the directors that winds up on screen kruger has obviously never paid much mind the old chestnut sometimes less is more and his numerous twists cannot even claim be originals arlington rds ending is direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself saying something they should not know pronouns used protect the gender of the character grammar be damned how did you know that the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along since twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how krugers screenplays usually come equipped about three twists per ending guess it is no wonder why he works so frequently he is quickly becoming miramaxs mickey mouse the company has already signed him work on several of their upcoming projects this is appropriate considering that miramax used place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles their companys current logo could be we ride the trends reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick affleck is such puppy dog that it is impossible believe he could survive in harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyones bitch the role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close self parody as can recall recent serious movie getting it may have been wiser had the makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy who is played here gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance james frain is nick rudys cellmate manslaughterer who is found pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron ashley is prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she is never seen one picture of him works out fine since the character is killed in nearriot and rudy who was be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place leads sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and surprise visit from ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked his thuggish cohorts he plans rob an indian casino on christmas eve the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according what he wrote in the letters ashley used work as guard in the indian casino though the end the pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything have described might as well be irrelevant this is what you can expect should you chose take this reindeer on several scenes in after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds stall interminably until the good guy has chance kill his captor and crack stupid oneliner included two scenes of two different bad guys explaining their motives the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less though it is an action the ending is more talkfest where we get the whole movie explained us one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience the flick was directed john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the alist following string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up it would be success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one marlon brando in mime makeup and not so flattering moomoo and now this he films action sequences minimum of quick cutting like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for brainzapped mtv audience pick apart problem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than further pad out the running time and remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than filmed radio play character problems abound rudy is made shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off the former he can do ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster charlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next she never has chance evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top further italicize this gary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than threat these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on script little but stock characters and bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience,0.0

hong kong cinema has been going through bad spell the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking the same qualities of hong kong films in nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous the one time british colony reverting back mainland ownership lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific work on s productions such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yunfat anna the king the corrupter and yuen wooping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of filmmaking mixed results now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers the mix star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of typical action and none of hong kongs rhythms the opens in nightclub as an asian couple is necking enter group of chinese gangsters led kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down it is not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends the following morning po sing is found dead suspicions escalate as issac oday delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans move out of the business of corruption and into legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington watch after his son and daughter the scene shifts prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder he fights the guards and is dragged off be disciplined hung upside down one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping the s han sets out find the person responsible for his brothers death romeo must die is in many ways fun it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of gangster wanting become legitimate echoes the godfather the relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras china girl except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in history the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course has the showiest part having express both an innocents and steadfast determination allayah in her feature debut manages carry what little is asked of her certain style and grace it is obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for b woodside as issacs son colin the performance is undirected the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak does workmanlike job in handling the having career as one of the industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how set up his shots and romeo must die does look good but the pacing of the is lethargic only coming semblance of life during the fight scenes the script eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property facilitate the building of sports center for nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever the best things about the are its fight scenes jet li is master of these intricate physical battles one needs only see his fist of legend understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity show off in way that lethal weapon jets s debut did not allow unfortunately lot of jets fights are aided computer effects that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent obviously homage the famed xray scene from sonny chibas streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere the pacing of the it is as if the has stopped and video game has been inserted one problem though about the fight scenes those that are familiar hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm them heartbeat so speak in their choreography the fight scenes in hong kong breath an emotional resonance this is created the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern the rhythm is monotonous hong kong has tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact rmd is limited standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever fine example of this difference can be found examining couple of jackie chans films watch the restaurant fight from the rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have heartbeat and emotional draw that does not let the audience catch its breath the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is grand and personable screen presence it is shame that his full talents were not used full effect here one day filmmakers here in the s will stop making films the numbers and start embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such commodity until then we will be left emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die,0.0

among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed robert ginty star of the bgrade action films of the previous decade those who tend not be nostalgic about can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star as director ginty did very little improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love christina ford played bo derek however she has relationship rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter hill robert mitchum happens be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films having almost all characters behaving like total idiots unfortunately this is not comedy and any laugh is unintentional the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen them the actors that play them do not help either that is especially the case jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played fahey in lawnmower man looks like genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she did not age enough cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents ginty on the other hand tries bring some life in the movie using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating the already bored and dissatisfied viewer,0.0

my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free as lamely directed michael lehmann the picture tries be comedy using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending since it is rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains mystery other than few nice visuals there is nothing recommend the picture great comedies under his belt from when harry met sally the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that he is more than the worlds best oscar host he does however have propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing go ahead project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he wants be dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious the movies somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it the next day this onejoke movies single idea is place reallife basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after car accident sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant oneliners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car sammy decides get serious seeing max as his meal ticket and although he does not like it he is willing sign max up do disgusting events like wrestling match halfdozen dwarfs the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever after series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into cheap and maudlin disease movie we learn that maxs condition is terminal and he will soon die be fair the movie does contain few good scenes all of you can see in the trailers let us hope billy gets himself pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie my giant runs too long even at just it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both gave the movie single star and had nothing good say about it matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been amen he went on comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was,0.0
talk about movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters spice world is the feature debut of the prefabricated pop band the spice girls it is intended as sort of hard days night but ends up simply hard watch when watching the spice girls am reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely one personality quirk and different name the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented there is ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashionconscious one and scary melanie brown the one tongue pierced back so far you are almost certain the post sticks out her throat the itself does not really have plot it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall the action however seems more like hodgepodge of mismatched ideas the various misfires include an alien encounter fiendish tabloid editor scheming wreck the spice girls the shooting of spice girls documentary movie producer george wendt trying pitch various ideas for spice girls movie nearly all of though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess they ended up meeting pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems be maintain the maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends boating adventure bus race clubhopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even when they start sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general allaround celebrity stuff whew for some reason the is littered star cameos from elton john elvis costello from bob hoskins meat loaf heck even roger moore shows up though he cannot decide if he is parodying himself as james bond or if he is lobbying be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld richard grant has the largest secondary part thankless role of the bands manager clifford the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and decent way pass the time when confronted the rest of the neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos my advice fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd couple of more times either option will be more enjoyable than the nonfans should know stay well away from this one,0.0

one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating have given the might be something like oh that caseys gone and become jaded critic on us just what did he expect out of dumb teenage rock roll movie like this am wondering the same thing feel like should have had grand time detroit rock city it is the sort of movie wish could have had lot of fun but did not just did not surely this is not trying win any major awards so should have expected an oscarcaliber no but expected something funny joke clever prank plot development anything the movie never delivers you have got marvel at how the filmmakers managed come up movie that is truly about nothing detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent minutes watching movie in absolutely nothing happened justify the films existence and it is not very satisfying realization the is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying get into kiss concert in detroit michigan that is it there is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington they have garage band they are pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock roll so guess that means we root for them they have tickets they lose them they get more tickets they lose those too they come up crazy schemes get tickets most of backfire there is not much more it frankly it becomes little less than exciting see them try get kiss tickets about halfway through the when total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only be lost because of their sheer stupidity oh and jam real name jeremiah has really really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought be reported the child welfare agency she does not want them see kiss if you had not figured that out already it is really quite disheartening see such fine soundtrack go waste in pointless movie like this we have got plenty of kiss along some acdc ramones and thin lizzy then again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big acdc fan that am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time detroit rock city does not quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close in fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being complete failure in my mind basically the soundtrack has earned the full halfstar means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose halfhearted cover of acdcs highway hell sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up it is also really sad see the talents of the cast go waste because it evident that they are all trying really hard squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of movie edward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey they have got make living in people wanting see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song too bad they might have provided some energy this mess director adam rifkin knows he has not got much material work so he takes chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning we get an endless parade of quickcuts splitscreens zoomouts zoomins and rotating cameras all in an effort cover up the sheer stupidity of the script it is fun for while but eventually it becomes disorienting would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby have not felt such an urge reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon and what about that script it is written carl dupr sounds like as madeup name as have ever heard if it is cannot say blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible plotless pointless rock roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny the jokes in detroit rock city rarely are in fact the only time really laughed was when priest gets stoned on marijuanalaced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy there is no setup just succession of punchlines that do not provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no setup it is as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see funny look that woman was so shocked hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink see funny look that guy just got clocked telephone receiver twice see funny look that kid has been vomiting for minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about perform an exotic dance for money see funny word of advice mr dupr no these things are not funny all themselves they must be preceded clever setup so the audience hasn predicted them five minutes in advance that is it have said enough about this movie it is waste of time and money liked the music but do not bother buying the soundtrack hear it just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie you want see this concept executed well go rent roger cormans classic rock roll high school it features another lateseventies rock band the ramones and far more interesting story about girl trying get tickets their show yes go rent that and skip detroit rock city will probably bomb and deservedly so,0.0

funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways the ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed me promise hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature what it delivered was mystery science theater level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters get new jobs was one line if remember correctly at the end of the th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired build british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda he is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is jerk and now two maneating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off patterson tries handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns charles remington michael douglas hunter of world reknown or something like that the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and costarred siegfried and roy they are nighinvulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs have one native after another stepping forth solmenly recite lines about the power of nature give me break the movie has not got the wherewithal even begin exploit such ideas it is just trying find convenient ways stall us even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic get this remingtons big plan is build large scaffoldlike structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion show up he does this and then gets knocked off bird the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead my hand the acting is forgettable douglas does good job of portraying relatively cracked fellow but it is nothing he has not done before kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography the camera the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent what did expect from this movie dunno some real excitement suppose sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation no such luck dug out my tattered copy of hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber and read that get the taste of this movie out of my mind,0.0

ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of mechanic named darrell while darrell puts new hose on the ride bobby walks into town see what is cooking is it needless of me say that superior arizona is not

as terminator stretch it bit and we have fivefinger discount from doc where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic okay he is working from book so maybe ollies not totally blame for blatantly copping these ideas just expect man who can make up an alternative history of the united states be able craft few original ideas before exposing the negative just wish he had not brought cast like this together for what amounts group toestub sean penn gives great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters the best thing about the movie is watching penn react the madness around him and try figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on too bad it is not fun watch when it is happening us while we sit through this mess of uturn is not bad if you are fan of technique it is the oliver stone you have always known robert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how shoot flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures but pictures of what think would rather stare at xeroxed envelope for two hours than try figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser plot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie have seen in the past five years oliver know your body of work is nothing sniff at you have been nice enough limit us only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty dig on your scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors do not dog it and know that maybe uturn you were just kicking back just having fun that is fine but do not do that movie the potential of this one do some police academy sequel imagine that do big comedy like remake of it is mad mad mad mad world but do not drop limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like weekold snook there is right way have fun and wrong way have fun this was as wrong as you can get without going jail,0.0

rated for strong violence language drug use nudity and some sexuality starring wesley snipes anne archer michael chaykin donald sutherland marie matiko running time minutes directed christian duguay have never fully understood wesley snipess career he has his ups and downs but mostly the downs his best movie was one of the best of and that movie was entitled blade he has had his typical action movies boiling point passenger but his new movie the art of war should just be called rising sun the art of war cause basically it is semiremake of the same plot different cast and forced be ridiculously unbelievable thriller that is high on style and low on substance wesley snipes plays james bondish type secret agent working for the n after chinese ambassador is killed he is on the track of the killer trying find out who it is how it happened where the killer was and what do anne archer plays his boss type person of the n and she has hired snipes track down the killer well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer and is now an outlaw kidnapping chinese woman him and having her help him along the way all this leads finale that is so dumb and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb and the stunts dialogue and acting all ruin this movie wesley snipes is not one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before the only good role snipes has really had was in blade walked into the art of war expecting good high octane thriller and all got was pile of mush the only real good thing the movie has is action and plenty of it but noticed it is badly filmed the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful that it even tries mock the matrix laughably funny it is undeniably stupid christian duguays direction is also not that great his camera angles and sense of style are all in place but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done even the whole matrix ending was not even good the stunts and action are badly filmed and badly choreographed his placing of the characters and the assination of the chinese ambassador and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie anne archer who is usually good in her roles turns in horrible job here she is sour downbeat and dreadfully dull her forced dialogue and dumb moves even donald sutherland as costar cannot save this movie from being bust so for an overall opinion the art of war is total waste of time it is not entertaining nor exciting or even action packed it is pointless movie and makes absolutely no sense at all if you really want see good version of the art of war rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind rising sun it is not great either but at least it is better than this,0.0
movie reviewers have an obligation see the good the bad and the despicable originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in but wanted rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics we need be warned about some truly awful films too this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my rating see ratings chart below the only thing saving it from rating is that being able rent movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting porno so it does indeed have some plusses in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff and her ability whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately far too annoying far too often like in bulworth when the movie was over did not care one little iota about the main character at least warren beatty tried make statement his dreary and overrated though showgirls is too stupid make statement some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph mankiewicz was he would be well he would be good screenwriter instead this project may have sunk his career he wrote the ha ha script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed the same team who created good sexfilm in basic instinct struck out here their occasional violence gratuitous xrated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas make it big as dancer after the supposed streetsmart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nomi does not take advantage of this contact break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away first she becomes lap dancer at scummy strip club she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience hey never said she was not hot number maybe it is that her body gets her into the bigtime when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly is not her brains or pleasant disposition crystal requests private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan he also happens be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystals understudy the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts claim that she is not whore that is phrase we hear few different times and it is completely ludicrous of course she is she sells her soul make it big but in the end we are supposed believe that she is better person than that we are supposed root for her no way she is tramp and backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the ahem climax she is not good person and they take over two hours explain that the audience should think that she is the subplot male dancer glenn plummer who claims see talent in nomi is just gratuitous opportunity let her dance naked little bit more it sure as not character development plummer also appeared in speed in in smaller yet better role this subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control kyle maclachlan must have been promised big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet that picture was weird but some critics claim it is one of the best movies of the now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the too his sleazy character is important showgirls but we do not learn anything about him he uses people get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well the other characters in this movie is he villain who cares ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit everyone must know now about the softcore acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool what few reviewers take issue is how meanspirited this movie is everyones either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge it is just too hard take especially for over two hours if we must be exposed the evils of the vegas world why could not verhoeven have also made point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers it is hard care about these people if we cannot even appreciate what they are capable of doing onstage berkley may have future in because she can dance and she has great body after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting pauly shore and cindy crawford oops they are bad actors too well at least they are not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone useless triviaironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teenybopper tv show saved the bell

mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan so you should know what expect weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever jackie chan plays who else jackie this time out he is famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show not that it ever makes difference in the plot there are only two scenes of him cooking for the rest of the somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and local gang of toughs the demons although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles hmmm shades of broadcast news anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything recover the tape here lies another crucial flaw in the story does not anyone realize you can copy tape oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had make sense as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and would not you know it jackie accidentally ends up the tape this leads countless chase andor fight scenes look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie in move apparently designed woo american and other englishspeaking audiences the uses english as its primary language however that does not mean an end the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed english and poorly too whether this is just very bad case of looping an effort minimize accents or simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse have jackie on the run from various goons but even though plots have always been second the action in jackies films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us this tired retread look if you have jackie chan playing chef why not use that your advantage watching jackie doing his stuff in kitchen beating the bad guys foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts the action is mixed bag here there is really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films it takes place in the arbitrary location of construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan the action in the is neither jackies best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting once or twice it may be useful highlight spectacular stunt sequence but slomo jackie running either this is nod the sixmillion dollar man or pathetic attempt disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down if you have seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy however if you are just in the mood for some good action you would be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop,0.0
first rule of fight club is do not talk about fight club this quote deals directly my opinion of this because quite frankly it is not even worth mentioning director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge crude humor an intolerable script and hours and minutes of pure torture am surprised did not walk out this just goes show that hype kills it is very rare that so hyped up as fight club turns out be noteworthy and this is no exception the story goes like this edward norton is an insomniac trying enlighten his dull life going variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at session that he also attended apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain why any person would think of such thing is beyond me but things do get worse norton is soon assigned job that calls for traveling and it is on plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt the two men develop bond and go out bar and golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight how do they come up this stuff anyway their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention and club is formed out of all this mess there manages lie message fincher shows us that society is like robots we work in our jobs doing things step step and want out our insanity gets our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others call me crazy but this is common knowledge think fincher was acting as if the is moodier and more poignant than it really is is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably even two good actors and solid actress they only manage weaken the story could not help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into bloody pulp it just shows how desperate the script is for attention guess brad pitt was right for this role because felt like beating him up myself his bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his million fee it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more helena bonham carter however really had no purpose she just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left this continues for what seems like hours the drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what think might be the end unfortunately then the hits rock bottom though the conclusion kept my interest for mere minutes it backs down again and continues move at snails pace on side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer fincher will hopefully regret making this or at least learn lesson concentrating on the atmosphere or particular key moment will not do any good if everything else is in need of support also am afraid that immature men might respond the films violence the last thing the world needs is people praising leader of pointless cult when the ends am just glad get home and take some advil you will either enjoy what the has offer or agree ed norton when he says this is so ing stupid,0.0

there is foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact would say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies are getting more irwin allen esque every release the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew include thrills every five ten minutes deep impact tries disguise itself as human drama endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that there is remote chance comet will strike the earth but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan stop the problem then we get see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and there is remote chance it will strike but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan stop the problem it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going fail how do we know this because we have seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading ladies and gentlemen that is the movie successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its second tv spots television is what is wrong deep impact the main character played tea leoni is lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc and that is the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg who stumbles upon huge government conspiracy she thinks it is an instance of an exsecretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her keep it under wraps know you are just reporter but you used be human being she figures out what is really going on after getting roughed up some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between mistress and an extinction level comet upon topsecret meeting president freeman leoni agrees keep the story under wraps until the president can hold press conference at she gets ask the first question and everyone knows if you get ask the first question baby you are star leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comets collision course earth and am sure it is comforting for her know that even though the worlds ending in matter of months she is cable news personality so there she is narrating the sixastronaut mission blow the comet up such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process but as anyone who is seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces means even more destruction the earth yeah thanks nasa that is when freeman has come on tv for the last time and say goodbye all the people who are not picked live in the missouri cave site for two years they even have animals two two ready climb into the cave if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been far more interesting movie instead we watch as lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town the reasoning is of course that if comet is going strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location and amusingly the highway is spotted people in uhaul trucks am sure it is comforting know that even though the worlds ending in matter of minutes the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives,0.0
there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him appear in followup the crow anyway the idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into sequel franchise revolves around the notion that different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world given that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions of course it does not stubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks the beginning of the previous when lees eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave do charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend death remember the first primarily as harrowing exercise in brutality in flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in realtime as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind it is loud and repetitive true sadists delight but it is also horrifying and fascinating city of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully there is an audience guaranteed for like this although bad reviews and poor wordofmouth will likely ensure that it will not be much of success in fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings have never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key the success of movies like the crow so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup this time ashe frenchaccented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off pier the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead perez might have some screen presence if he is given something do himself but here he is simply thrown in front of the camera as pretty face at first he is shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes badass biker from beyond the grave he is befriended sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first kirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank tattooed angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded judah richard brooks but far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays gaunt fellow named curve iggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this like all good things here he is dispatched too soon and without much imagination in the meantime we are subjected tedious glimpses of judahs compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in sm fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they were not distinctly secondhand even the soundtrack is tired more than anything have seen from lately city of angels smacks baldly of product it is movie lousy script but great look critics have been quick fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work is not that bad per se he is got good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery his major stylistic failing is that he cannot seem direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of low budget kung fu movie but as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that was not the performers who could not and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved who bought david goyers anemic script anyway the producers of this crow were either too dim realize their story was doomed be hollow rehash or too cynical figure their audience would know the difference,0.0
late in down you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation her boyfriend freddie prinze jr the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy the is multimillion dollar testament everything artificial filled characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster prinze plays college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman coed at first the movie seems be an attempt string along scenes the sole purpose of outdoing the previous in how cute it can be the happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out song because as prinzes dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning let him know she wants make love then in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart why well because they have otherwise the couple cannot make up and live presumably happily ever after down you exists outside the realm of normal logic scenes do not connect each other and it often seems be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated goat the supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well stiles best friend rosario dawson is pot head prinzes roommate shawn hatosy is girl crazy fool who cannot meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on you know the average porn star the costume epic idea gives him reason appear in different ridiculous outfit everytime he is on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be couple of stupid sex jokes she is porn star mostly so we know she is slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted attempts at drama means julia is going cry include pregnancy scare and the big break up these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated these weak scenes what happened here the cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems be going places writerdirector kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off in fact the whole feels like reworking of last years extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences the direction is filmschoolgrad obvious it is stylish in hugely self conscious way throws in split screen pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion plus the whole story is told flashback style narrated prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera this is the second in row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due the fluke success of she is all that if he does not start making better choices fast his future films will not be so lucky,0.0
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer does not change thing since body of evidence was not written him but has puzzling eszterhasish presence all over it in other words it is really dirty and really really stupid madonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on houseboat and likes parade around seminaked presumably for the edification of the shrimp she is been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover already two classic examples of sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in movie cannot be sexual unless she is under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men what is worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well madonnas character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had heart condition and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy this movie leave no scummy stone unturned anyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed run afoul of madonnas sexuality how do we know this because his character is set up the token wife and kids how obvious is it that he is gonna cheat on her and have fess everything up and get kicked out of the house and get welcomed back anyway do not skip the end yet we are just getting warmed up dafoe and madonna have lot of sex in this movie most of it is about as erotic as openheart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who do not know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs do not ask another thing that people are starting realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important the story it is insanely dull what is worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninthhand from other bad courtroom drama scenes the thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as surly doctor and the ending another homage eszterhas maybe is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings this mess was spliced in the director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit brooklyn and christiane everyone has eat guess but this is not meal ticket it is leftovers,0.0
it was great anticipation that sat down view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable the academy award winning had been highly acclaimed it also featured the music of one of my favorite composers james horner what was in for was disappointing and overlong was anything but the best picture of what drags braveheart down is its screenplay it abounds high production values john tolls awardwinning cinematography also graced edward zwicks legends of the fall gorgeous score horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names but this does not save misguided script the wishes paint its central character as hero but the viewers only response his heroism is intellectual william wallace producerdirector mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have root for him but wallaces actions paint different story he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the paints an unconvincing emotional portait in wallace is just not as bad as the english king wallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance after kicking the english out of scotland he decides invade england this is evident of spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves sacking roman cities the spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down an awful screenplay it is shame that such an excellent score is part of such terrible horners score tries make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help gibson portrays wallace in such way that the audience cannot relate him or identify him this drags down any emotional connection the films plot and turns three hours into total waste of time,0.0

virus is the type of cliched vacuous that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it strangely enough on the same midjanuary weekend last year another was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on cruise liner prior movies the almost exact same storyline include leviathan deep star six and all four alien pictures virus in comparison is servicable thriller wellmade and produced but since it does not include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the was shot on based on series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat becomes extremely damaged during violent typhoon after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them huge ocean vessel that appears be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen once the team reaches the russian ship they go on board find that the place is seemingly deserted after turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working itself one survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station then was transported down the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out if virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies you are correct although the technical artistry is fairly impressive bring the mechanical creature life the itself does not appear have brain in its head the sticks so close the wornout conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters play in her second return horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves be strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it although halloween was also disappointment at least she was given few scenes develop character unlike here donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently starring in thoroughly disposable films such as the puppet masters although just watched him in the superb scifi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous the last of the three topbillers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing do basically virus is another one of those films where group of people walk around and investigate space shipocean linerhaunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them onebyone it is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this as long as some of them keep making money suspect the answer is never,0.0
over years ago japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun gojira reptilian creature of immense proportions created mankinds nuclear testing partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean terrorize tokyo year later gojira was marketed the united states adding three things new name dubbed english track and raymond burr as godzilla the took on the rest of the world thirty years later toho remade the classic and once again took it the american market adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla now it is years after tohos remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard make an american first run in emmerichs godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos biologist who is called in join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of radiationinduced super mutant leaves footprints the size of livingrooms when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back the states meanwhile tatopouloss college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant bigtime news reporter she would like be reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break of course the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound cross paths and are joined victor animal palotti hank azaria audreys trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place together they attempt find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make truly deserving of the name godzilla he did not right up there the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and it is up our heroes figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts bring the creature down the script however is painfully bad it is fraught lines so corny they do not even belong in bmovies and includes many character actions make you think you idiot or you stupid girl suppose when you have got movie giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well why is it that godzilla topples some buildings merely brushing against them but is conveniently able leap atop others why do helicopters have follow godzilla flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him flying little higher and in straight line why do sidewinder missiles have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla why is mission bomb madison square garden carried out three fighterbombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two okay maybe the last one was bit nitpicky but hey was on roll broderick is usually good actor but in this he is weighed down an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay seem fight against him every step of the way hank azaria does what he can but do not expect see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage like brodericks azarias character is quite simply lacking in color what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse her acting casting must have been asleep on this one the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems fit well into role is often comedic quite unlike what we have seem him do in the past although his character is contradictory the unfolding disaster reno brings style the role of phillipe makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities the entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek and seems pay comical homage dozen or so films that have come before it this results in significant amount of parody contrasts sharply the threat of the monster and ends up just producing mess most of the characters seem be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted make fun action picture what good is it sink millions into cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined the humans he threatens if we cannot take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply do not care what happens them godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt be more lighthearted than it should be far be it from me want see more carnage in the theaters but heres behemoth running through the city there is bound be lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted the afterschool i joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems get out of harms way just in time in couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used any particular advantage the filmmakers it is as if the special effects people just wanted show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one does not just leave the door open it opens into hallway leading directly into room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently it made me want gag emmerich should have done away of the humor and injokes and played this one as straight action an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more however confusing the viewer ton of addins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just does not work now if they only had raymond burr,0.0
before the remake of psycho appears we have got suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock dial for murder as usual has filled it glitz and big name stars and it all amounts loud sounding nothing the opens emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment the problem is paltrow is married stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair if was paltrow though would definitely go mortensen less wrinkles anyhow stephen approaches david an interesting proposition he will pay him kill his lovely wife mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the progresses unfortunately the dosent progress very fast in fact it moves like tortoise arthritis read very very slow the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts not too good for thriller also the performances apart from douglas are below par paltrow showing immense talent in seen and sliding doors is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie mortensen is little bit better coming across as younger douglas but his role is not meaty enough show all his talent leaves douglas waltz away the is does however doubt douglas finds it very hard play stogie smoking drinking womanizer creepy underside also popping up in the is david suchet playing shifty looking detective again it is not character we are seeing on the screen it is david suchet the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoomins quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting however looks cannot save this from the depths of mediocre and the seemed work better in single set anyway the screenplay is k but there is some hackneyed subplot about douglas being ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears lose all intelligence in the last reel combination of no tension drama or decent characters perfect murder is failure all round and an incredible disappointment there are few bright moments but they are far and few between the last thing thriller should be is boring and although the just barely manages keep your interest thanks michael douglas you would not be missing anything if you decided not watch perfect murder overall rating review david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes,0.0
coinciding the emerging popularity of movies that deal anything related serial killers relentless low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels relentless third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had catch vicious serial killer in his very first case does not want deal similar line of work divorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns his old post when los angeles becomes hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection one of dietzs old cases make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order bring dietz the investigation fans of the british tv films and miniseries like prime suspect or cracker would probably see lot of similarities relentless series of movies they both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give lot of usually depressive details about chief investigators private lives this one is not an exception but similarities british television are only in content the execution and style is different makes this mediocre piece of entertainment at best useless gratuitous erotica also does not help either obviously making this longer than it should be the actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career signy coleman as dietzs love interest is on the other hand quite miscast but she will not have worry about it in the future career since relentless was not supposed be anybodys finest moment anyway,0.0
edward burns tackles his third picture no looking back and like his previous two it is workingclass relationship picture however unlike his previous work the dwells on more personal story and female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making slow boring without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is small town waitress who is feeling stifled her life she is at turning point in her life and feels as if she is going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in dead end job if she were marry him she would never get chance escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudias old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back town see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudias father return now it seems that claudia is about make the same mistakes at only little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and there is lack of energy the whole proceedings makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes misstep casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame there is no one restrain his ego reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given mostly bland and ineffective role work there is not much recommend in no looking back it is not that the is bad it is simply boring there is no zest in any aspect of the and no reason spend ninety minutes watching it,0.0
i do not expect much from eddie murphy these days for the past four years the gods of cinemaor the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerateshave allowed him make one bad movie after another such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced once great comedic persona living and breathing washedup hack performing as studio puppet for th century fox and universal pictures the biggest shame fall on his shoulders is his newest nutty professor ii the klumps the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places sherman has just invented new youth drink that enables man or beast become younger for short period of time janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for soul mate rather than excel at her career as university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons love on his mind sherman is determined rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman act like bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers some convoluted mumbojumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into handydandy lab beaker but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain thwart the good guy then the klump family all played eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that lost count after the first thirty minutes and did mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped an overgrown hamster the movie finally dissolves into really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene pure and simple the klumps is failure its script was handled not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process it is more discerning learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped this trash hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes the characterization of shermans family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of black family have ever seen in cinema everyone member of the family is large person who wipes the bins clean at local buffet restaurant like pigs at trough the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways pleasure her man and her sagging breasts the father is gruff is fired from bluecollar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate his family about his feelings the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems hold no opinion about anything or anyone the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience become attached but the main problem the is its inability create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct and you got the feeling that these crass people could not act like this all the time the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last or so unbearable and pathetic after while their conversations just become barrage of frustrated anger tinged indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story its also damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy interact himself in such beautiful motions are built around such lame story line even the best effects cannot seem save the most pathetic of movies these days now that think about it the worst thing about this has be all the money that it will make people will be lined up around the block for it the studios will concoct the sequel for release in the summer of eddie murphy will be signed up take not just one role or five roles but he will play every character in the movie just cannot wait see eddie murphy in love scene himself,0.0
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise him sadly he forget bring good story and believable characters nic cage plays rick santaro fast talking cop who is watching boxing match his friend commander kevin dunne sinise an assassination takes place and santaro tries peace together how it took place trying work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy the uses flashbacks and video cameras bring the mystery together however the does not keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the is at dead end although there are some fantastic shots de palma including minute steadicam shot at the start of the halfway through the drops dead the problem is that de palma does not have strong story or characters work he tries offshoot this flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and quickly got bored nic cage and gary sinise try inject some life into some poorly realised characters but it is no use they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable yes another problem the is that there is noone root for we are supposed be on cages side because his character becomes nicer throughout the however his change is sadly unbelievable poor gary sinises character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way the films use of flashback quickly gets boring while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the has nowhere go they certainly do not increase the tension or suspense of the movie there is small thread of suspense running through the but it certainly does not make this powerhouse thriller rather just slightly below average one the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional certainly not good factors for passing itself off for thriller the most depressing aspect of the is that it had potential there is good story buried in snake eyes it is just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end while the performances are intriguing especially newcomer carla gugino as sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case there is no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is terminal case of style of substance and unless you are big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes,0.0

lucas was wise start his star wars trilogy episode episode is boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects after the familiar long time ago opening the starts the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies the peaceful planet of naboo ruled queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent negotiate deal the confederation stop the blockade however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have deal many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd star wars is largely failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters the script desperately tries make an thin and boring story into two hour epic the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent there is no underlying tension and no urgent need see what the outcome is the also takes leisurely pace in telling the boring story does not help there is no snap make the work it moves at plod the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother there is no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders it is evident that not much is going happen the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little do and too much time do it quigon and obiwan hold no presence on and give little for the audience root for the audience will probably warm more bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time maul is one of the most underused bad guys in history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the all the other plots in this are be concluded throughout the trilogy anakin is annoying and unlikeable instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended it is probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible the comedy relief is supposedly provided the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the him although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned pod racer because knew he would not be able talk for while queen amidala is nothing in the she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go googoo over anakin again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little do here the actors do not help the movie much either liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate leave the movie as quickly as possible mcgregor comes across as posh mothers boy little charm the casting director must have chose him because he is scottish like alec guinness there is little other explanation for it natalie portman is plagued hideous costumes and poor script but she delivers spunky performance and jake lloyd looks at everyone hateful eyes and delivers his lines in bored voice there is very little talent evident him it is hard see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there he is not even very cute the main claim of the the special effects are okay there is nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well the cgi takes away much of the human element however the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers episode is just disappointing it is got high production values but little else the music is meandering except near the end the plot gives us noone root for or even care for the effects are nice but dull the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should there is an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich are catered for throughout the apart from remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is dry affair that serves little purpose except make money and get us watch episode see what happens the many unfinished plot lines in the disappointing is barely the word rating,0.0

tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me walk out minutes into the movie the opened in canada during but was never released in the united states is based on stage play canadian auteur robert lapage and while it is evident that this could be fascinating live production the translation the screen is creative disaster enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium tectonic plates has storyline although the narrative is developed in decidedly nontraditional fashion shots of the stagebound play intercut more typical cinematic sequences it is not an inherently uninteresting way present movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious allbutscreaming look art although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters because we are constantly made aware that we are watching play or movie it is impossible accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas they are not real sympathetic or believable am willing give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not success tectonic plates opens introducing us madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love her professor jacques lapage one day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels venice kill herself while preparing commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine rethink her decision meanwhile jacques has moved new york city where he starts crossdressing calls himself jennifer and becomes successful counterculture talkshow host settings that shift from paris venice montreal manhattan scotland supporting characters that include topless goddess and deafmute and cultural references that point chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else however as interesting as the sounds and was excited see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers the tone is soporific the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in pointless and irritating manner although it does not take long for the viewer determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious tectonic plates is trying show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes onehundred minutes get across this transparent point there are some worthwhile moments such as silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who are not bilingual the only people likely enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel strong need praise something this rootless and boring because it is different it is not like anything they have seen before and it is pretentious for everyone else it is not only waste of time but poor introduction the work of robert lapage,0.0

the are seen the short tends spend more time trying recount welles attempts it despite studio problems staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting historians sadie thompson s director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on somerset maughams story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newlyrestored version of frank capras lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills was interested see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films have ever seenlittle awkwardness and very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants save sadies soul but really wants get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life the character adding an worldly affectionate air the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult know whether this is due the lack of liveaction or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on cannot believe maughams short story ended sadie and our hero moving australia the stills are expected fill in conclusion we have been waiting an hour and half for still it is entertaining right up the end

from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews am guessing was said get people go see the movie obviously it has not worked since the million dollar movie has yet break million each it is own however since monkey bone is not only bad movie all together but technically wellmade tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone crude comic strip that everyone wants merchandise they go great links get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in freak car accident you will see stu goes into coma and while in his coma stu travels am guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come life people are stuck in this town their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really cannot stand he tries keep him under control making new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal pass monkey bone becomes trader and takes it and goes into stus body now monkey bone must get everyone buy these dolls nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really do not get know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well rose mcgowan ha story behind her but we are not given chance know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems bring the screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley is not given enough do as well as will graces megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the from being total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice look at the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems be like stuart little you really do not realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction henry selick is good but at times he does not know what kind of he wants make and the ending climax falls off the cliff it is too bad really monkey bone could have been real good movie but it is heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one,0.0
numerous comparisons can be made this movie past scifi suspense thrillers soldier is multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem such mixed genes is that the final product is real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done better choreography russell who is usually good actor in bgrade action flicks is unusually hampered his character sergeant todd who seems more like sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombielike is in line his screen persona but scores little points of empathy the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close the strangeness of former it is still long way from anything considered desirable,0.0

much ado about nothing ah how sweet the irony it is accepted wisdom in some circles among english literature nuts mainly that whenever critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance he just does not understand shakespeare you will hear them say the bards work is apparently beyond criticism what load of old cobblers if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs of shakespeares comedy much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word it is time get life get monty python get woody allen get john waters whatever just get real taste of some clever witty risky comedy and banish this nonsense where it belongs drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength my sensibilities and am no stick in the mud much ado about nothing resonates no spark whatsoever no kidding this ranks among the most embarrassing two hours have ever spent in cinema in my years of movie going the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty my lady friend as this was our day out and had not seen her in ages but boy does she owe me one will not spend too much time on the plot basically we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples one young the other older there is some dark treachery amongst all this but everyone is so awfully jolly that you would hardly know it mind you there is nothing wrong the basic story good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound nothing wrong most of the cast either branaugh emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers the problem is the script or more accurately shakespeares original text light comedy should not be complex yet wrapped in elizabethan english the dialogue becomes difficult comprehend for this alone it will be problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than good undemanding laugh the only laughs escape my belly were brought on the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves the actor once again miscast as jealous halfbrother or something but when dissected and understood what it all boils down is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold ho ho ho boy likes girl ho ho ho men are such klutzes ho ho ho she is so awfully clumsy oh please there is wit in here somewhere am told call it pretentious something lightweight striving be something sophisticated through clever wordplay in the end it is cringeworthy watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse laughter made much ado about nothing very weird movie going experience comedy bah humbug,0.0
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and host of other popular low budget movies that turned nifty profit off thin story line it is filled likable establishment types living in quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin the strength of this lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol the is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the at least be viewed as containing pertinent message its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about be escalated into colombia the drug war has been total failure so far and no hope of it being won law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing americas jails be overcrowded nonviolent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply billions of dollars have just been allocated congress get officially involved in the colombian civil war backing corrupt government remember vietnam the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam this scenario closer home so what probably awaits such an effort is more futile result than the other war the films mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable the public something that should have been accepted some years ago is theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never there has be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how educate the public on this rather than making it police matter altogether the opens in quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of middleaged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide the widow soon finds out her husband was bigger bastard than she imagined he left her stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable year old house as collateral for failed business venture taking out second mortgage the widow finds herself bankrupt and no marketable skills pay back her husbands enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless she also knows that he was having an affair sophisticated woman from london honey quick what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring honey she finds out that he was tiger her in bed but refrained from having sex her even though the locals try help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides stay on her despite his last check bouncing since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her help him revive his hemp plants he grows for private use the two soon see this as possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles the plants turn out be highquality stuff for grace this is way save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers chance for him continue live in this beautiful village and earn enough money marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not notice what the bright lights in graces greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you cannot control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation the story becomes incredulous when grace decides go london and score bigtime drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and does not want matthew end up in jail it is interesting note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go jail the scene grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying find drug dealer while dressed out of place in white dress and hat one would wear tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking make drug deal was completely hokey and the descended into huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity the moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing survive as she meets an international drug dealer frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes millionaire and writes best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming celebrity things work out in ridiculous way where there is total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood there are lot of silly giggles that come forth and the has just enough of an acting performance brenda blethyn breathe air into it before it comes its belated finale as it drones on its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded this unhip leaves one the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middleaged widows screwed their terrible former husbands must do in order not remain

love kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes at the outset the movie appears be about tony danza who is an illegal distributor of guns trying establish relationship an unsuspecting woman danza sets up double date her her sister and collegue of his everything seems be going well until the sister accidentally dies falling down set of stairs much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin emerge all after one thing or another sound confusing it is think what the filmmakers were trying do is take the standard crime movie and throw in little humour and levity in some respects it works but the majority of the is convoluted and confusing mess characters keep popping up no explanation demanding money for deals that occur offscreen the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister but so little time is devoted this part of the story we never really become too familiar these characters and because of this we do not really care what happens them well did not at least one thing will give the movie is that it is complete departure for tony danza heres guy because of his many sitcom roles who is ingrained in the consciousness as nice guy who always does the right thing here he plays man who is just looking out for himself and if that means he needs kill in order save his own skin so be it was very impressed his performance and within minutes of the start of the had forgotten all about his goodguy persona michael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up him and the other half trying kill him like said it is not exactly linear storyline love kill should be praised for trying do something different the well worn crime genre but it is just too bad that the story does not really add up much the stars deserved better and so did the audience,0.0

films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether they are about superheroes batman superman spawn or geared toward kids casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but there is never really been comic book like from hell before for starters it was created alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium whole new level in the mid part series called the watchmen say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting look little odd the book or graphic novel if you will is over pages long and includes nearly more that consist of nothing but footnotes in other words do not dismiss this because of its source if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors albert and allen hughes getting the hughes brothers direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better direct that is set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in londons east end it is filthy sooty place where the whores called unfortunates are starting get little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession surgical precision when the first stiff turns up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough calls in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow crack the case abberline widower has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries quell copious amounts of absinthe and opium upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it is not so and proceeds investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cannot stomach do not think anyone needs be briefed on jack the ripper so will not go into the particulars here other than say moore and campbell have unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses slay in the comic they do not bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriters terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias les mis rables do good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end it is funny watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days who holds back the electric carwho made steve guttenberg star do not worry it will all make sense when you see it now onto from hells appearance it is certainly dark and bleak enough and it is surprising see how much more it looks like tim burton than planet of the apes did at times it seems like sleepy hollow the print saw was not completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comments about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming do not say word ably captures the dreariness of victorianera london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks even though the violence in the pales in comparison that in the blackandwhite comic oscar winner martin childs shakespeare in love production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place even the acting in from hell is solid the dreamy depp turning in typically strong performance and deftly handling british accent ians holm joe goulds secret and richardson dalmatians log in great supporting roles but the big surprise here is graham cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually was not half bad the however is all good for strong violencegore sexuality language and drug content,1.0
every now and then movie comes along from suspect studio every indication that it will be stinker and everybodys surprise perhaps even the studio the becomes critical darling mtv films _election high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is current example did anybody know this existed week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an overachiever her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul popularbutslow jock run and pauls nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right be you cannot help going in the baggage of glowing reviews is in contrast the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely have _election good does not live up its hype what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ released few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick _election_ is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved the school play max fischer _rushmore_ is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved the school play the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student tracy flick is from single parent home has contributed her drive max fischer is from single parent home has contributed his drive the male bumbling adult in _election_ matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets bee sting the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay _rushmore_ and novel _election_ contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from genre the high school geeks revenge movie that had not been fully formed yet even so the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as pauls antisocial sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from _ferris bueller_ and he seems be having the most fun he is had since then witherspoon is revelation it is early in the year it is comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbells character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then you are won over one thing that is been bothering me since have seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this suppose that coming from mtv films should expect no less but the starts off light and airy like sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr does not like tracys determination win at all costs but did they have throw in the studentteacher relationship even so there is no logical reason why mr has an affair when he does there is lot like in _election_ but the plot similarities _rushmore_ and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sexdriven mark this as disappointment,1.0
you have got mail works alot better than it deserves in order make the success all they had do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it is body it is basically complete reshoot of the shop around the corner only adding few modern twists essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking it is overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not mention very manipulative but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because absolutely hated the previous ryanhanks teaming sleepless in seattle it could not have been the directing because both films were helmed the same woman have not quite yet figured out what liked so much about you have got mail but then again is that really important if you like something so much why even question it again the storyline is as cliched as they come tom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of familyrun childrens book shop called in nice homage the shop around the corner fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business little do they know they are already in love each other over the internet only neither party knows the other persons true identity the rest of the story is not important because all it does is serve as mere backdrop for the two stars share the screen sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison the utter cuteness of the main relationship all of this of course leads up the predictable climax but as foreseeable as the ending is it is so damn cute and welldone that doubt any movie in the entire year contains scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love was filled such for lack of better word happiness that for the first time all year actually left the theater smiling,1.0
jaws is rare that grabs your attention before it shows you single image on screen the movie opens blackness and only distant alienlike underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dahdum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on midnight swim beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like theatrical production first act and second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has great deal of restraint and refuses show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music he is building the tension bit bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying he does not let us get bored the imagery the first act opens police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there has not been murder or gun fired in years the island is shaken up several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton does not want shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined matt hooper richard dreyfuss young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated the shark as he is determined help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark it is perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted it jaws is thriller keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and it is no wonder it took america storm in the summer of taking in enough money crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in star wars even today fascination this is on par hitchcocks psycho and it never seems age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the because it only would lead overkill the technical limitations faced spielberg in may have actually produced better because it forced him rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused be overshadowed the shark scheider hits just the right notes as sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what is right and going against the entire town it is your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz gives surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance robert shaw as the movies captain ahab performance sorely overlooked the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism he is slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost caricature however there is one scene late in the when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the s indianapolis navy ship in world war ii that was sunk the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than week over other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the of course we cannot leave out the shark itself its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are threat every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce the crew built be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was sort of precursor waterworld movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered

apparently director tony kaye had major battle new line regarding his new american history i do not know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether have heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input studio has over the films they produce as it is found american history be an extremely good not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it is hard believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own and making himself star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history is one of the very best performances this year he plays young man named derek vinyard skinhead living in venice beach his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly dangelo and sister davin jennifer lien the opens flashback in derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the presenttime of the danny is in high school and eager follow the footsteps of his brother much of the is told in flashback and we see the path that leads dereks adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now fullblown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries get his brother understand why racism and the violence that comes it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms it is hard make controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history is mainstream there has be redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way make him sympathetic partially disagree this because although do not advocate racism in any way it is interesting the way kaye presents derek he is loud obnoxious man but he is also very smart the reasons for why he becomes skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed group of black men it is clear that he is passionate about his beliefs and that he is not just punk looking for an excuse beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton play this part it is astonishing how frightening norton looks shaved head and swastika on his chest in addition getting the look just right he is perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and whole lot of shouting and norton does it all ease even when he is at his meanest derek has likable quality him and that is gutsy approach when telling story about skinhead what adds depth the story is subplot in the principal of dannys school avery brooks becomes obsessed purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific standouts from furlong dangelo and lien visually the is very powerful kaye indulges in lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add moody atmosphere but like lot of movies lately american history skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends pretentious preachy resolution featuring brief narration from character who was killed for movie so smart subtle up until that point it felt like slap in the face be handfed theme in such simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his perhaps this last scene was the problem it is hard imagine any director not being at least partially pleased this good in time when so many movies are timid and weak american history manages make compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way,1.0

i have noticed something lately that have never thought of before pseudo substance faking deep meanings in their films have you ever seen movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing more and more filmmakers seem be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being great but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff am not trying say city of angels is that bad it had lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was gigantic hole somebody covered iridescent performances and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added the disappointment but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie doctor who begins ponder exactly who it is we are fighting against when we fight keep someone alive after losing patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there oversee the patients transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated the doctor he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love her everyday angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability make themselves seen anyone they desire seths adoration is too much resist and eventually he does appear maggie quite regularly although such thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but it is nice touch that never seems like mere attempt at uniqueness cage is wonderfully versatile actor think faceoff raising arizona and it could happen you what combo who slips into the role of heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once it is nice see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire the two are not very comparable each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and it is an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance enjoy but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us his interpretation of hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye it is shame that so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just did not know quite how get it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey others thru word of mouth so after telling us for minutes that this is glorious masterpiece they sure leave us disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths based on the german wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goers the noncynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere give criticism that needs be criticized nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating is probably enough satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate delve into rich emotional territories,1.0

the police negotiator is the person the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting talk dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends do lives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone turn on the negotiator at moments notice the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition being police officer he must be able think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower most of all the negotiator must be able enter situation as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants it takes pretty smart person do that but what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart what if he is also able think on his feet in fact what if he also knows all the tricks turning the situation his favor it is this circumstance forms the basis for gary grays the negotiator in this police negotiator danny roman samuel jackson is tipped off his partner corruption within the chicago police force when his partner turns up shot death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder faced the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny the media roman is forced turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office do not quite remember if the captain actually said hate do this but although it would not surprise me if he did luckily the soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered takeitorleaveit deal the district attorney roman resolves prove his innocence walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum t walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed although romans actions seem forced due the compressed nature of his motivational buildup gray redeems himself involving us the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey soon ensue jackson while superb actor is miscast in the role of roman the actor has become so popular and so often identified as protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have difficult time believing he will carry out his threats the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying prove his innocence how can we believe he is going shoot hostage no matter if the hostage tried kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception saps the of some of it is wouldbe suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed jacksons acting ability almost every time he is in scene jackson steals it without looking back when spacey appears the has already run about third of its course his is an interesting character made out be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying get his family moving set out on vacation can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but cannot talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says when he gets the call action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him be soon his character has negotiate not only roman but also the swat commander david morse who is itching send in team take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting take over the operation should negotiations fail this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor as the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely gray really lucked out this cast david morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes jackson and spacey the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the a in a confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land the level of acting however this can be forgiven also in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect laugh before he even says anything fortunately this does not distract from the seriousness of the rest of the but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension gray manages sustain throughout t walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in one of his final performances sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon be released pleasantville will mark his last walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one of his best performances check out sling blade in he plays mental patient sharing ward billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men whom he credited his success the actors performed together in few good men the negotiator is actually dedicated walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for walsh had become most famous for playing in the end the negotiator has plotline that parallels it is reality we are served the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other resolve the conflict in the manner will suit each of them best as an audience we are also given situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into movie and we would like see if one will dominate the both provide some pretty good entertainment,1.0
plot young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon whom he is devoted tribute band in he sings gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him take his place critique am sucker for movies like this young man humble background and lofty dreams works hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hits it bigtime in the case of this our boy loves certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it yup luck always finds its way into these types of equations although generally tied very closely hard work they need new singer his entry and adaptation the whole rock roll lifestyle fills the rest of the and is really fun watch although will preface this saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it metal was one of my first loves as teen and even though the genre of music is not that prominent anymore still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again that is not say that you will not like this if you do not like the music but the music and live performances from the band play big part in the movie and for one had blast watching and listening it all but the even greater draw in this is the standout performance given here mark wahlberg wow hand this fella some major props as he totally becomes this heavy metal geekgod incidentally metal god was the films original title and much better one if you ask me he is this movie and was quite taken his character pretty much the whole way through he came off like regular guy extremely passionate goals and work ethic who was willing do anything in order fulfill his dreams aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend and the romance angle between them was sweet but she did not pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes was also impressed some of the real musicians who played in the zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elias from slaughter but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members it is note that this was based on reallife tale of young man who used sing in judas priest cover band and then went on become their actual singer their original singer also admitted being gay as in this just for the record am certainly not recommending this for its originality or surprise elements since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies but because it is fun uplifting wellpaced movie solid central showing wahlberg and energetic live performances oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rocks you see dreams can come true where is joblo coming from almost famous blow boogie nights detroit rock city girlfight goodfellas,1.0
carry on matron is the last great carryon in my opinion made in it still features most of the regulars of this genre sid james plays the head of gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off make profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also hypochondriac hattie jacques retakes her role as matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard this time williams is after matron jacques when he needs prove himself that he is man after visiting dr goode the doctor hawtrey is sworn secrecy assure you that anything you say me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other bernard thinks he is having sex change and needs prove himself there are great cameos from joan sims an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he is at work at the railway station sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try find out where the pills are getting cyril dress up as nurse and live in at the nurses home he has share room nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon sees through him the ends the attempted robbery of the hospitals pills panic ensuing there are good performances hattie jacques as the matron however her character seems little more subdued and quieter than her previous matrons williams is as usual on top form but sid james is not given very good part in this movie and would forgive anyone forget that he was in the movie at all the same does not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after minutes gone and has scarce screen time he seems steal every scene he is in not making use of sid james and barbara windsors talent full effect the seems flounder but it certainly makes up for it it is good storyline and it is other appealing characters this is genuinely funny and could watch it again and again and not get bored,1.0
the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting memorable score and clever script the takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor the demanding public elliot ness and small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible trying stop capone and trying maintain peace and order however as ness soon learns in order stabilize peace you have bend few laws the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes the begins capone played perfectly deniro declaring that he is not violent man and he is firm believer in following all laws the then quickly transfers the next scene in one of capones men bombs restaurant that contains many innocent people including little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is lying bastard right from the first five minutes of the de palma has created hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs this developed hatred is before the films hero ness is even introduced found this approach be very clever because in small duration of time there is great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the only gets better from this point the formation of the untouchables there is group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats they walk in unison and they only look forward as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared citizens holding shot guns and pistols in their hands stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films one that comes mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfits of the same style the similarities between these two are countless the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action the four members were the only ones willing go against capones army each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others elliot ness played perfect ingenuity kevin costner is character that surely grows during the course of the he begins as man who is determined follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be however as the develops so does ness his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side he also begins lose his stability when his adversaries begin murder his friends his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides make one final run as member of the untouchables malone acts as mentor ness he teaches him the chicago way do things when they attack knife you attack gun connery plays his character the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia does wonderful job as george stone young man who is just becoming police officer as ness grows he begins teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief the the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed have ever seen also very similar the matrix they are exciting and intense from westernlike battle the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed the score during these scenes ingeniously adds the excitement its pounding drum beats act as rhythm for the actors the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this is pure entertainment and contains unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid,1.0

a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july from ace ventura truman burbank jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic characters the cable guy was supposed be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting as most everyone knows the results were well lessthanstellar not only did the not do so hot at the box office but it was also panned critics as far as know gene siskel and are the only ones willing admit that we dug it the first time saw the cable guy in theatres was in super criticmode and did not really like it however due the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day have had time lean back relax and take in the and my surprise it grew on me the plot is rather simple broderick plays guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played carrey then is stalked him when steven tries break off the relationship see stevens been having some problems his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he does not think he has any more room in his life for new friend also some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out carrey as the cable guy gives steven various aliases later we find out are all tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently lives in his cable van and while many critics did not enjoy this newer darker lessmanic performance from carrey thought it was interesting and rather welldone for me its not the movie as whole that is enjoyable but rather several individual scenes karaoke jam at stevens apartment medieval fight at theme restaurant and bathroom beating la liar liar just name few perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny and if you really want see something you have got hear his version of jefferson airplanes somebody love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam the cable guy has its bad spots like most any movie did not particularly like stevens girlfriend and felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend also the ending while having you fooled for moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing still found the cable guy be worthwhile venture if you are at the video store and cannot think of anything rent suggest you try it out or if you have hbo just wait till it comes on you will not have wait long hell that is what do every day,1.0
when bulworth ended allowed myself sigh of relief it is possible for me enjoy political satire there have been several recent political films that did not do whole lot for me wag the dog for instance found be an intelligent but heartless while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness bulworth is far better than these both in its execution and lasting impression it is tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center writerdirectorstar warren beatty allows the audience identify his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again he has not slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane he is not stark raving mad not outright anyway but he is definitely bonkers it is the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him speech feed group of black people in church in the ghetto bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party does not care about the african american community well he shouts laughing is not that obvious the story is propelled device in bulworth puts out contract on his own life he muses later that it is bad thing make decisions when you are suicidal he keeps seeing man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes be the hitman bulworth also meets nina halle berry whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworths nononsense truth in politics methods become national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he is appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is man who is reached his limit and his way of lashing back is screwing over the entire political structure like that the does not take clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run the rich although the antirich sentiments do get bit tiresome the end of the some of the segments are simply hilarious such as lengthy rap that he delivers at luncheon dedicated him much of the is completely absurd but that is the fun part about it it is an angry serious at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre what adds this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth this is performance that deserves recognition on higher scale beatty is so much fun watch here he is always funny but he is also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous as always and adds her repertoire of solid supporting roles don cheadle has good role as drug dealer who uses guntoting toddlers do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday fear he may induce heart attack the intensity of his acting though he is very funny watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent his list of mastered inflections is bulworth offensive suppose some may see it that way was not offended the but then again hardly care about politics think that people who find this offensive will just be blindsided the honesty of the story the is not perfect of course the ending did not quite work for me and the few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant bulworth is smart uproariously funny picture that proves me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface,1.0

the most common and in many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppolas masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia is presented as an institution guided ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective his own more downtoearth vision of mafia in mean streets movie that dealt lower echelons of organised crime unfortunately for scorsese his was unspectacular and too artsy compete coppolas influence on mafia portrayals in the movies seventeen years later scorsese returned mean streets of new york another that dealt darker side of american organised crime this was goodfellas epic black comedy is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity the fact that it was based on the true story told in bestseller book wiseguy nicholas pileggi who would cowrite the screenplay for the the book as well as the chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill played ray liotta irishitalian criminal from new york at the age of he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs up the ladder starting small errands after couple of years together his best childhood friend tommy de vito played joe pesci he joins the crew of expert thieves led jimmy conway played robert de niro three of them spend years as best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate one of the most spectacular robberies in american history wealth influence and privileges of men connected mafia are enough for henry hill seduce his future wife karen played lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even be accomplice his own private drug dealing business but the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begins fall apart tommys unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence jimmys reluctance share his part of the loot partners and finally henrys own drug habit would lead his downfall and make him question his loyalty the friends goodfellas is an excellent example of that represents work of genius in his full glory scorsese managed create vision is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker world depicted in this is both ordinary and fascinating scorsese spares no effort show us all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages make it both seductive and funny after being exposed two and half hours of the and three decades of criminal history based on some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and shortlasting glamour and prosperity of criminal the dullness and poverty of honest citizens scorsese also manages break viewers moralistic inhibitions showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in manner that would make it amusing and funny the audience the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue or narrators commentary goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era even if we do not pay attention skills potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker first we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue then instead of single narrator scorsese switches the second character as narrator in the middle of the only switch back the original shortly afterwards this multiple points of views both in terms of narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation same ironic distance comes extremely effective choice of soundtrack nostalgia for good old times is illustrated easylistening pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late and but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast the scenes of violence and bloodshed however thing most associated this is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting dozens if not hundreds of people such scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors in fragmentary character of the screenplay does not have straight plot and instead bases on series of loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese he uses this structure of experiment and most successful of such experiments is hilarious day in life segment near the end of the another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents the most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen be most quiet and businesslike member of criminal trio gets overshadowed two of his friends and colleagues joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including adlibs probably represent the most memorable element of the ray liotta although equally talented perhaps does not look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the liottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of lowlevel street thugs liotta on the other hand improves general impression very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction lorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable as karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering smalltime gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave as combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time because of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of,1.0
the blair witch project was perhaps one of kind unique that played completely on its own merit managing scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses its success made sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel suspect anyone much wanted after the release of the blair witch project tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order get glimpse of the blair witch locals have turned this mass hysteria into great business opportunity selling twigsculptures stones and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods bullhorn shouting get out of these woods and go home there is no goddamned blair witch jeff is one of those people who has used the sudden popularity of the small town his advantage after he got released from the mental institution he created mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods on the blair witch hunt among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing book on the hysteria caused the called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dresses in black and has some psychic powers the last member of the crew is erica young beautiful witchwannabe who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back you threefold this strange group plunges into the woods where they begin argue about their different approaches the experience on the very first night that they decide spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parrs abandoned house strange things start happening when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain after while they discover strange markings on their bodies they are somehow lost in time as it loops uncontrollably back and forth they are all haunted hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone them from the woods documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch leaving the creators of the first dan myrick and ed sanches in the background the opening scenesthe documentary showing the townspeople affected the first is more promising approach because instead of trying cover similar ground it goes outside the first and makes its own stand but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked its own story that is never resolved and ends very anticlimaxic epilogue in way this is typical sequel more money has been spent and more people have worked on project that was doomed fail the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated of course in these situations quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloodyred forest carter burwells being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that the exception of its title this has absolutely nothing do the blair witch project blair witch was filmed handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation in the sequel the technical aspect of the is close perfection creating completely different atmosphere its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the has very polished look is impossible associate the first installment and though berlinger directs his an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body couple of times he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor the key is simplicity blair witch project had story was incredibly simple that allowed the audience fill the gaps our own imagination the was practically an empty screen on we projected our most frightening nightmares the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir everyone but in different way book of shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict here very little is left our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first get lost in it there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied this is simply less artistic that does not have the talent and originality of its predecessor it resorts fancy cinematography and special effects create the right effect and does not always succeed but most importantly it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection the first movie does not allow it destroy the original in the end cannot call it bad effort it is less artistic not so scary and less original but certainly not bad it is simply different in fact if you have not seen the blair witch project you might like this for what it is cross between the blair witch project and the scream films the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism but it is common knowledge and experience that few exceptions every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limits commercial success that the book of shadows is certainly assured and it is already time look forward blair witch,1.0
seen may on home video rented one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise some films it might be just secondary issue but dark city what we get is nearly an entire committed philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifullyconstructed the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie there is an old roleplaying computer game called d ja wherein the player takes on the role of man who cannot remember who he is where he is and how he got there the goal is gather as many clues as possible figure that out and along the way overcome conflict the premise this is not unlike that game only this time we do not have control over the protagonist we begin meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it is more than just the city it is the whole reality that is not just that neogothic look la batman blade runner but is so fully developed it is almost different genre completely later he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he has no idea what is going on other than the fact something is not right the fact there is dead body in the corner goes enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him leave immediately is also very chilling this opening scene alone goes long way define the setting of the and its bizarre horrific tone the man does not know who he is nor where he is going and it is interesting follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify him in fact this is the way all stories begin since it is impossible know the history of character their feelings values morals etc until after we have observed them for while but in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story eventually some semblance of plot begins unfold as it appears that john is serial killer wanted the police we met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional softspoken deadpan man who appears have been on the trail of the killer for some time two other important characters are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claims be johns doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old filmnoir movies it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the he also contacts emma further helps the reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story but absolutely nothing is as it appears be in dark city is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo everything the filmmakers want us see has some significance considering how intricate the detail is every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they do not seem be able afford any gratuities however that might also be what is keeping it from reaching its maximum potential continuing follow john as he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come realize that it is all hoax everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted race of aliens understand what makes humans tick in their efforts somehow save themselves from extinction but as the films tagline says last night one of us went off for reasons that are never clearly explained it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known as tuning the aliens look like very old bald human men pasty skin also possess the power en masse and use it change the city every night at midnight at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then this premise certainly is interesting and director and coscreenwriter alex proyas is able keep the consistently mysterious in this regard he does provide some explanations such as that dr schreber is an assistant the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form the aliens mix and match the memories of the citys population see who will change and who will not in the process this creates for good deal of deep thoughtprovoking philosophies that could be applied the real world however where the errs is not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as what makes person who he or she is the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery never actually happened yet when they start go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant static and cold mediocre performances hurt and connelly do not help either for example john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond her yet in some scenes crucial the films plot we are expected believe they do have genuine love for each other is also part of the films climax and ending and that is what proyas seems be inferring the but never quite manages convey in its fullest sense ironically this is what made his first the crow work so well had similar theme of struggling find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world dark city the messenger seems be mistaken for the message still the is no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable there is lot like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all accounts for at least half the reasons the is able tell the story it does the story as whole is one of the most original come out of in years dark city is what the movies are all about the escape from the real world,1.0

you have heard all the hype you have seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindlers list as quigon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obiwan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker if you have read any reviews you have also probably heard that this movie fails live up the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this ones too kiddiefriendly and does not have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidalas sumptuous robes are fit be worn queen elizabeth but there is something missing here and it is not budget or effects it is everything money cannot buy the actors struggle as best they can flesh out broadstroked and flat characters the most successful at this is liam neeson who as quigon jinn jedi master young obiwan kenobi has quiet dignity and wise commanding presence he is the anchor this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portmans queen amidala and mcgregors obiwan kenobi do not fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was vulcan geisha in former life and obiwan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that he is nothing but robin quigon jinns batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully infuse this surprisingly small supporting role spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does good job he also absolutely nails alec guiness obiwan in episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that is one of the problems this would never call myself star wars fan especially not considering what it means be fanatic these days but have always enjoyed the films along everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who has not seen the films at all or even recently or who does not bother brushup on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the films main nefarious characters is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vaders master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful lot of the movie is like that rd and cpo make token appearances and it is obvious that lucas is banking on the audiences preexisting fondness for them because he does not do much add it in any way same goes for jabba the hutt who does not look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leias home planet we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing what is the result of tying so many plot points and characters future films the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty there is no meat no substance that makes you want love the characters as they are not as they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the was distracted the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and cpo who got their humanity if you will pardon the expression from their interactions the human characters jar jar is often left interact mostly others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders the plot oddly this is not just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this for kids well he is done good job the hero of this of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me feel any kinship or identify an eightyearold boy that is not jake lloyds fault though he does good job of being cute kid is apparently all lucas asked of him that is another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there is nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he has doting mother pernilla august making her first english language and is slave gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid is not all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him train as jedi under quigon jinn his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble quigon dies at the hand of darth maul scarylooking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned the dark side this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves his doublesided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because quigon never gets chance train the young anakin in the ways of the force obiwan quigons young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins obiwan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need be told would say no but is it worthwhile movie see absolutely if you do not enter the theater jedisize expectations and you simply want be treated an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod races are triumph of effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obiwan are worth seeing for their origins in simpler happier time above all this is fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan cowrite the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential,1.0
as african american detective vergil tibbs questions suspected white murderer inside jail cell there is wonderful eyecatching shot instantaneously presents the main message of the entire the shot has tibbs face completely covered the shadows of the prison bars see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the as black detective conducting an investigation in southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen these bigots as threat simply because of the color of his skin the bars show that tibbs has not been given fair chance show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous this one shot amazes me because it captures whole theme in matter of seconds it perhaps may be the most powerful image have seen in in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america jewison has very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused the abusers he is also not afraid tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present preceding the very original soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters the won best picture in focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly sidney poitier as fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses give up on an investigation in white town where is he not wanted tibbs is man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him as hero who is not afraid face off against five men chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist poitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice his character never nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian soothing however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance as sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows great amount of skill in his role he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople he would refer tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him as the progresses though there is very gradual change in the sheriff he begins see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors what really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect tibbs at the end of the he still could not refer tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil instead it was apparent that he was eventually going see the world differently in the future most movies would have character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in matter of minutes this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone believe something one day and believe something else the next day jewisons determination make this as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or major city and small town in the united states during the it displays this perfectly however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the lacks interest it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving credible explanation involving the murder victim there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being suspect was not needed also it is given that tibbs is vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic congratulations has be given actor scott wilson he managed be in the two best movies of in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood,1.0
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor such livedin naturalism that believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mids in those performances he tended exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions the world you would think such man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath goodnatured veneer but from gordon gecko nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance is not showy or tour de force it is simple yet truthful he embodies grady craggy old writer predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs writers workshop while working tirelessly on follow up the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played the always understated tobey maguire student full of potential and one whom grady develops mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone just hint of dry wit around the edges he is portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is little too calculated he reminds me of the selfimposed outcast director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever happen catch jarmusch in an interview see the man speaking in toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar guy who equates quirks depth tobey maguire fits well in the role his round sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier warm up he is messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah beautiful talented writing student just itching get in gradys pants this is plot line had trouble douglas in his old age is beginning resemble jerry springer man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first found it extremely difficult believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe it is because am jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all may just be lowly internet critic but at least still have all my teeth then think of douglass real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks lot like kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and am pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is great line in the spoken douglas about sara where he says she was junkie for the printed word lucky for me manufactured her drug of choice robert downy r plays bisexual editor who makes his entrance towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many hipster intellectual he is arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains joyous movie presence somewhere between typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor wish wonder boys had more of him searching for plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but that is part of its charm and maybe am bit biased towards the because it takes place in haven of literary academia place am greatly fond of and place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has subgenre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen be privy am privy films about literary types e those individuals enthralled the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise knock my above grade down about half notch the direction curtis hanson is more akin european its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that is problem wish found films more often another minor quibble is that early on the seems bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman a h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana is not ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last la confidential toiled about exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in wonder boys party it fits the is like piece of literature put up on the big screen it is the cinematic equivalent good read novelistic in its approach themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but found much savor among its subtleties,1.0

the event of events is upon us people have waited twentytwo years for the prequel star wars and diehard fans have been camping out at theaters for months get tickets see it do not think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of has caused it is not bit of an exaggeration say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tells you it is just movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up the kind of buzz is far too weak word that star wars epsode the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that does not mean that the itself is bad in fact it is terrific strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed it have simply surrendered the media machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decades before the events of the original star wars took place the focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate what is affectionately known as the force quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor negotiate unable stop the tide of events that was about occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant try and get the republic senate intervene on the way they get sidetracked planet called tatooine where they meet the movies real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong him so qui gon is determined take him them the jedi counsel and get him trained as jedi as any selfrespecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up be darth vader and give birth luke skywalker from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie around of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far plenty of broad comic relief go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jarjar binks he is essentially computeranimated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out cutting away from them and the movie is thrilling triumph if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you did not already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score john williams even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really does add punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia when you see long time ago in galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen you will feel tingle even if you did not see the movie when it first came out in it feels oddly exciting be introduced young anakin boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony see the jedi masters aspire get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like we are seeing the beginning of saga that we have cherished for years the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is very worthy installment in the star wars it works as an action flick visually eyepopping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories piece of exquisite nostalgia eugene novikov,1.0

he is back and it is about time was the motto for this television series pilot call it pilot do not care what fox network says revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series means there are no smart network execs out there not exactly news lot of people know the motto was well chosen the series was simple it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor thirteen lives who traveled around in type forty spaceship called tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly eric roberts as good as this revival was there is something missing from it make sure it was really doctor who is it the acting hell no paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who have played the doctor including his predecessor and offscreen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene he looks right for the role is brilliant actor and slips effortlessly into the role the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would daphne ashbrook brings class her role as dr grace holloway the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen she is not your typical female companion who screams and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is tough spunky american and ashbrook shows this well young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee and have seen him in other stuff in he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end this included imho wastes his talent the only problem the acting is eric roberts one time he had say mcganns doctor always dress for the occasion but he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like song lyric always dress for the occasion you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands act and who is also british like mcgann is as the doctor executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role dunno who thought of casting him but if they are reading this news flash eric roberts is not star he rides on his sisters coattails and any hit movie he makes has nothing do him is this problem the kisses the past they have references the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them only whovians would and they are good is it the script or the movie as whole the script is classy piece of work featuring master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie as whole is one fans will love and it is good stand alone viewing for nonfans enjoy the series so what is it simple no plot the master on his last legs sends for the doctor rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him the doctor attempts take his remains back gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco december where the master young street hood chang lees help opens the eye of harmony will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway does not close it then virtually no plot was told the movie would have featured the daleks on screen and started more of courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but lot of rewriting went on on the set that shows how smart people are as it would have made the movie hell of lot more interesting and that would have gotten four star rating out of me,1.0

profession as real estate agent she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family the third member of this antifamily is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyns daughter young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence but having also come terms her families growing dysfunction this funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple not one character is given less than is needed identify him or her some of the most telling characters are those that serve highlight other characters most notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts she has almost no dialogue and seems be either recovering from stroke or suffering from one colonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man his rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who has just moved his family the same neighborhood as the burnhams in fact they are the next door neighbors anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises be had in american beauty alan ball who was the coexecutive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays have hit the screen in the past ten years not one character in this rings falsely and the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful the plot detailing the last year in the life of man as he tries find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as bring mind such marvelous work as the graduate or lolita kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of life that is spiraling into old age finally unable deal the lost soul that he has become lester tries return his youth he quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one years salary starts smoking pot fantasizes about his daughters girlfriend angela mena suvari in marvelous performance here starts working out and finally takes job at the local fast food outlet mr spaceys performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured see him name among the five nominees annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career carolyn burnham is woman who has become so insecure as be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy unable cope her growing disillusionment she forces herself maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder ms bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as be identifiable almost anyone the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker charnel house martha stewart is too frightening express in words thora birch holds her own against the talents cast her jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is dysfunctional family and rebellious child ready abandon them at any moment her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as warning she is the prototypical trophy child when carolyn praises her daughter after performance her cheerleading team am so proud of you honey you did not screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable thora birch is young actress watch praise must also go chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role life depth and resonance colonel finn is man in complete denial his military upbringing masking desire he is too repulsed even comprehend wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma the boy next door who may be more foe than friend deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivities mask deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him mr bentleys performance is the one troublesome note in the that is simply because the character is such grand and complete liar that one almost faults the performance for it director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle scenes of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that calls attention the emotions of the character the subtle cinematography conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of it is harsh beauty fall has never looked so inviting yet depressing every nuance of american beauty begs it is audience think and examine it is that will be discussed and debated for years come and well it should as it is simply one of this years best,1.0

if there is one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios it is that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively it is obvious there is no significant movement underway promote inventive ideas at the theater so when movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in blanket of innovative ideas and served up on platter of fine production it is welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for nothought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings narrative intense and intelligent undertones the screen the story both about the joys of living life the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema not in recent memory has movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail see the ingenuity of ross work it is still testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite bit of luck find themselves zapped into fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times it is not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins teach the townspeople in quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is closeminded mayor t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out jeff daniels and t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy for daniels it is his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh it is complementary exclamation point on fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start finish there is not much dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who do not,1.0

at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those minds of year olds that is true of home alone and would bet money that it is true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick does not get in the way the mcalisters all of them are going france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plaincheese pizza has already been eaten and he is going have starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the alreadychaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table few cousins and an uncle the kneejerk reaction is for everyone blame kevin nobody came his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine ohara who sends him up the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in big hurry get the airport in surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him it is interesting that in subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class they are twothirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true he is finally rid of his family life is dream come true he can jump on the beds watch rrated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brothers secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is scary monster the old man next door is snowshovel murderer and two crooks are trying break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he is not much of an actor still we can see that kevins character grows thanks some good direction and editing for example acting has little do the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man pass on his request he wants his family back the real santa he learned how deal the furnace you turn on the lights and it is not so scary anymore he goes church one evening and there he sees the snowshovel murderer who actually turns out be nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movies genuine dramatic setup it is dessert it is lot of fun and it does not overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin does not act very well as said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevins life about five times instead of am gonna get that kid they say am gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but strongly disagree mixing comedy specific and viable threats of murder is sociopathic fauxpas will probably never see home alone and wish had skipped home alone but do enjoy home alone almost every year do not let your impressions of the others detract from the original has much more offer than cartoon slapstick,1.0
comedy rated pg runs about starring john goodman kathy moriarty and bunch of teenagers directed joe dante and written charles hass summary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror mant premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis he hopes capitalize on the tense moment providing an escape for the town we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them quick and easy review really enjoyed matinee the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely unlike many comedies this tries and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for laugh the makers of the also cared about telling an intelligent story the performances of all the principals are right on the mark particularly john goodman as the schlock master so would definitely recommend this anyone looking for light hearted yet interesting way spend couple of hours longer more detailed review beware of spoilers the primary reason enjoyed this was that while being comedy the also had an intelligent story tell too many comedies today subscribe the the notion that comedy need only make you laugh you watch the movie laugh lot leave the theatre and take nothing you matinee is not like that left the picture thinking about what would do faced the cuban missile crisis found myself wondering what would happen the characters of the but most importantly found myself caring about what would happen the characters the comedy of the centers around goodman his character and the he brings key west believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today he is highly expressive both physically and vocally felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink the other characters are often lost in scene him due his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the the movie is really the story of the four teenagers discovering who they are and what they want against background where at any minute it could all end thought the kids reaction were highly realistic they tried block it out they tried escape from the concerns of their world unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly the fear and the chaos of the time while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teens there was great deal of overlap several aspects of the panic are shown in humorous light one example is scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in grocery store if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly be the backdrop for comedy but it works here another reason like this is that like science fiction movies one of my favorite films go watch is plan from outer space note did not say it was one of my favorite movies but one of my favorite see while mant never got made many films like it were and mant serves mostly as dantes homage the bfilms he loves so again would like recommend matinee anybody looking for good humorous story this is not gag like many other comedies but an intelligent wellthought out about real people real problems told in an often hilarious way enjoy,1.0
when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become commonplace image when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool spaceships when han solo goes light speed the stars change bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point cool _october sky_ offers much simpler imagethat of single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky was it really only forty years ago when sputnik was launched and that before then no satellites ever existed have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside breathlessly see thentechnological achievement even though it was from the russians it sounds hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ found myself caught up the enthusiasm of homer hickam played jake gyllenhaal determined make dent in the space race he becomes transfixed his desire make rocket that could fly like the best of them it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket when lovely teacher miss riley played laura dern suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair we know exactly who is going win but the joy in like this is in the little details for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class if he has any strengths whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and good organizer it means that he may have lose his reputation associating the nerdiest kid in school who knows more about rocket science than he does it means that if his father forbids him shoot rockets on company property that is the entire coalmining town he must walk eight miles one way just set up the rockets will fail fail fail and fail again homers dad is played chris cooper favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ instead of organizing union rallies he is the head of the coalminers who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year note how multidimensional his character is he is his sons last nemesis as one who most likely interferes his sons dreams but he truly loves his son and wants see him succeed the only way he knows how through coalmining because of his character we can see how far weve come the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us see society advanced at rate far faster than any generation before us we dont understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way raise family the paradigm was shifting under the fathers feet and he knew of no other life so _october sky_ far from being merely feelgood inspirational offers much food for thought and this is the best type of inspirational the one that you take something you btw the final image of the is just as simple is as strong contrast as the aforementioned horizontalmoving white dot against the nightsky background another commonplace image be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago,1.0

the computeranimated comedy shrek is designed be enjoyed on different levels different groups for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed host of familiar faces loads of action and barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related body functions and yucky substances apparently requisite in contemporary family films for adults it is fractured fairy tale packed rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids all in all shrek is snappy ride although there are couple of points found disturbing but first the basics based very loosely on childrens story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character rotund green ogre voiced mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using shrek is grumpy fellow living solitary life deep in the swamp until local nobleman disturbs his peace petty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of string of impolite oneliners owns the land on shrek resides he proceeds turn the ogres yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle as result shrek finds himself surrounded legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears name but few an enraged shrek storms the castle only find farquaad john lithgow ready bargain lord obnoxious wants become king and the magic mirror from snow white has shown him the way all he has do is rescue damsel in distress and make her his wife the mirror unveils three choices in presentation straight out of the dating game when snow white is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives seven men she is not easy farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragonprotected lava moatfilled castle in she is held captive and brings her the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests move back on his grounds shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied motormouthed donkey eddie murphy determined make the green grump his best friend they finally hook up the princess only learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected meet for the matter the dragon offers few surprises as well the movie references great many other flicks from babe thatll do donkey thatll do the graduate but the lions share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney the publicdomain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred as possessed toy and when shrek spies sleeping snow white in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaads royal domicile closely resembles certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in relentlessly peppy tune that sounds lot like it is small world brings me disturbing point number one laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them bit sad the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known for years the two companies have tried sabotage each others and video releases issuing similar competing productions on the same day and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie attack his former employer heres suggestion for the two boys grow up put the past behind you there is room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads cannot play nice then go your rooms the other area found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad beyond all the irreverence shrek actually has message people should learn look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within it is lovely notion but the betrays its own moral incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaads diminutive stature do we really need family reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable the pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough make him target for zingers adding short jokes is simply mean still shrek is rollicking good time the computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is good one trot out clich shrek is fun for all ages parents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is bad thing,1.0
after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese you will never eat bowl of ramen the same way again there is scene where an old man is teaching young one how eat the soupy bowl of noodles as master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize it saying see you soon of course it is meant be parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it certain degree of sobriety you begin appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience experiencing it is process engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts trust me you really want go find noodle shop at this point juzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food the forefront making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of small holeinthewall noodle shop trying fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka goro defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into fight the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious goro finds that tampopos ambition is have shop that people would flock from far away just eat bowl of her ramen the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing however goro agrees help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of wealthy patron and make friends the former enemy this is filled many little scenes are absolute gems take for example when tampopo tries buy the recipe for delicious soup from another shop owner the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it her for more affordable sum tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her back room she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists just when she is about bolt for the exit he shows her small gap in the wall adjoining his store the noodle shop next door she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled joy that can be felt the audience this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery there is also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of restaurant and expertly prepares french omelet the scene is meant bring laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared all there are also number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the help illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives particularly effective one involves wife and mother being tended in her home doctor surrounded her children she is obviously in her last hours of life her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner the viewer knows the husbands intention is not be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this in near miracle the wife drags herself the kitchen and prepares quick meal then brings it her awaiting family as the family eats she looks on them and smiles preparing food for her family is joy and comfort her and for brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy then she falls over dead for moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating this is the last meal your mother ever made crying as they do so the family finishes the meal the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating disjointed but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline instead they even help contribute the idea that tampopos goal of being able serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble because the parodies western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in the good guys come together for the final showdown in this case the showdown is against the ramen if they eat tampopos ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded it is pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford cut it little slack,1.0
there is an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy return of the jedi the final installment of the series is easily the most innovative actionpacked and entertaining of the three films the dark eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone instead for return of the jedi we have good triumphing decisively over evil resolution love triangle and walking teddy bears even darth vader does not seem very intimidating this time around the arrival of the emperor an apparitionlike creature played ian mcdiarmid vader has turned into somewhat of henchman return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill princess leia carrie fisher lando calrissian billy dee williams chewbacca peter mayhew cp anthony daniels and rd kenny baker are on rescue mission lukes home planet of tatooine their goal save han solo harrison ford from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt it is at jabbas home creepylooking stone fortress guarded hognosed beasts that most of the added special effects come into play from hysterical scene involving music group the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge the effects are top notch as soon as han is freed from his cryofreeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt it is back outer space where the rebel alliance is about face the empires newest threat second more powerful death star that if activated could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor so while the fleet prepares for the final battle luke and company travel the forest moon of endor knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks there they are befriended the ewoks the teddy bearlike native race and luke fearing that his presence is endangering the group turns himself over vader return of the jedi has some interesting elements the scenes pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and wellacted from technical pointofview the space battles are amazing easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films not only are there many many more ships but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved on one level return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects in the special edition even more ships are added making the final space battle incredibly fun watch the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films now or then mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher have all matured in their onscreen personas the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific as in empire billy dee williams gives us another human hero root for newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as suitably creepy cunning and evil creature although he is not as imposing as vader was in star wars although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen return of the jedi generates greater sense of enjoyment the spectacular new special effects the adorable ewoks the sinister jabba the hutt the evil emperor the same old millenium falcon darth vaders incredible betrayal the destruction of the new death star and the always lovable yoda return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made huge bang congratulations george lucas whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue entertain generations come,1.0
why do so many childrens films treat their target audience utter contempt too many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just cannot handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues the iron giant was directed and cowritten brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it that is enjoyable for both children and adults alike hogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is spirited young lad who lives his hardworking single mother annie jennifer aniston in small town in maine after staying up late and watching scary movies on night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception he comes across giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as pet of sorts because of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like lost puppy realizing he cannot just keep the giant in barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him junkyard owned dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth cannot keep the giant secret forever because government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant threat national security he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarths house as lodger meanwhile the giant begins exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built be weapon of some kind the iron giant is exactly what family films ought be because it doesn talk down its audience the story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends young boy it is very similar the spielberg classic t and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant the holds many of the better elements of spielbergs such as the ability be sentimental without turning sappy the delivers several serious messages the most important of is ones ability choose ones own fate hogarth teaches the giant go against his programming and become what he wants be hero the final sequence is touching and appropriate though will not give it away will say that very few will be disappointed the animation while not up disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough make you forget you are watching cartoon the giant is computeranimated while the human characters are all handdrawn the oldfashioned way the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief fine voice work is turned in young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother harry connick jr does nice characterization as dean and really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tvs frasier as an army general called in agent mansley unlike several cartoon features each character is actually developed personality rather than stereotype and is actually integral the plot rather than being superfluous comicrelief sidekick clich disney still has not ditched dean for example could have been stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems suggest that but he is presented as character real emotions thoughts and motivations even the heavy agent mansley is not villain who does bad things simply because he wants but out of his own fear and paranoia lesser animated feature would have drawn up paperthin stereotypes and figure the kids will not mind but the iron giant has clearly put little work into making the characters real and it pays off the is not only around deliver heavyhanded messages though it is also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy the scenes in hogarth teaches the giant do certain things such as dive into pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt outlast one another trying stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever the even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown grade school students that tell them duck and cover in the event of nuclear attack the iron giant has much more of satirical edge it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing instead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get welltimed clever gags that seem have required some imagination come up when you get right down it the iron giant is no more than the story of boy and his robot the story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming though enjoy the complex plotting of noir as much as the next person when it comes family entertainment simple is the way go it is akin one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but it is not the story that sets the above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue the iron giant has in spades,1.0

the long kiss goodnight meryl streep tried it and failed even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her wellbared assets however geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star the long kiss goodnight preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed her husband renny harlin davis plays samantha caine mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey samuel jackson she slowly remembersand reclaimsher past as charly baltimore toughasnails cia operative needless say the reappearance of samanthacharly comes the appearance of an assortment of nogoodniks out erase more than her memory shane black netted cool mil for his script am not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such hefty price tag but for what it is worth it delivers the goods like blacks previous work such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout the script juggles some impressive action scenes funny quirky dialogue the humor especially works well in this case for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help keep things from taking things too seriously but there is no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after car while ice skating jackson and davis make good team jackson is funny as ever as ever in fact his spirited line deliveries especially when he first appears are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction as good as he is the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis who shows much promise as an action heroine what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she does not take herself too seriously she is obviously in on the joke slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation this is not say that she does not need worksometimes she lays on the toughness bit too thick and comes off too much as caricature but should the public embrace the and in turn the notion of kickass female davis could have found her special niche it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration the middling pirate epic cutthroat island was just dress rehearsal albeit very costly one for long kiss in the wifehusband team hit their action stride anyone simply looking for fun escapist entertainment that requires littletono thinking will find this be morethanwelcome kiss,1.0

mpaa not rated though feel it would likely be pg for martialarts violence three movies already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot properties in action adventure stardom and it is just about time for over twentyfive years jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong thrilling audiences both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and wonderful sense of comedy drunken master has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong am not entirely sure why exactly in many ways drunken master is similar most of jackies other early films such as fearless hyena and ii master cracked fingers half loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others in fact looking at all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookiecutter style at rate of four six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories be honest think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste they are quite different from action movies as we know them in america these films tend be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together drunken master though its plot is tighter than some is no exception as an aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie ever saw and saw it the way it was meant be seen in movie theater in seattle as part of an asian festival at the time did not really think it was anything special but after having seen more films like it it is kind of grown on me drunken master storyline is very similar that of other early jackie chan movies such as fearless hyena and ii and master cracked fingers slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts harshseeming master and has big fight an evil bad guy in the end formula that has been adapted put it kindly american films such as karate kid more specifically jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong aka naughty panther funloving practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not _quite_ good enough after embarrassing his instructors assistant beating him roundly then beating up bully in marketplace wong feihong tries hit on pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and is further chagrinned discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively his father wong keiying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up sue for damages keiying soon institutes harsh regimen of punishment feihong does not like at all while escaping from this punishment feihong meets up drunken old man who proceeds thrash him soundly then take him on as student and thrash him some more this turns out be su huachi legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu he assigns feihong series of bizarre tasks such as filling jugs water while hanging upside down from frame cracking walnuts his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up then when he is ready he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu unfortunately the lazy feihong only practices six of them drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences jackie winning some fights and losing others it is been said before but will say it againthese fights do not just _happen_ they are as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance and it shows in his fights jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways the fight scenes particularly those toward the end of the are unparallelled in most american films whether jackie wins or loses it is really something see and it is often as funny as anything too and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at there is very little that is new in this moviejackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly master jackie going through punishment or training these schticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties but they are still hilarious as ever likewise jackie has _great_ supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie films and they are often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own the really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including couple starring jackie himself and sequel fifteen years later was the drunkenstyle kung fu am not certain whether or not this is actually genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is imitate the wobbly movements of drunkard lull the enemy into false sense of security and it apparently helps if you are drunk while you are doing it genuine or not have admit there is just something incredibly fun about watching fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what is going on come think of it perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films it is not just martial arts it is the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go whoa on the negative side the cinematography in this is nothing special the stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard read against the background gone the wind this is not still if you like martial arts films or like what you have seen so far of jackie chan and want see more give it shot it is much more real than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme you might very well like it another interesting thing about drunken master has do its video availability in the us drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that know of that you can find in its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in gold box for about there are plenty of other early jackie films around but these are typically either in dubbed panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase thankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in it was meant be seen at very affordable price if you like drunken master take look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones are not really _too_ bad if nothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts of shaolin also the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain and comes _highly_ recommended this reviewer also for rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong who is in fact popular figure from chinese folklore have been told suggest the once upon time in china series starring jet li though have not personally seen any of them yet if you choose watch drunken master really hope you enjoy it and hope it starts open your eyes the wonderful world of asian cinema that is out there all in all give this an,1.0

logical time travel movies are nearimpossibility considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing script that deals this problem is an imposing task occasionally we get that does manage it terry gilliams monkeys was one such but more frequently we get films that do not much deal it at all there is one question ask in this case does the have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies the terminator films made up for them exciting action back the future did it an entertaining story and the new frequency pulls off the trick strong package of its own is frequency filled plot holes yes does it matter not really the opens in october of firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson the doublepronged story flashes forward where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as police detective strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son communicate through the same ham radio frank used in and that john has found in the present day though both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity warn his father against his impending death in warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom now flooded memories of full life his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes the timeline have been disastrous serial killer that would have died has instead lived kill seven more women frank and john now must work together set things right john using the information he has gathered in the future instruct frank on what do in the past the premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as result of their actions this is not explained you just have go it when frank does not die in fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities and are each other sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and could probably come up something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations are not really the point when frequency gets cooking it is riveting little thriller even if it is confusing what matters like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving the manages be engaging despite the logical confusion director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up goal be reached and conflict be resolved liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball drive the action forward it actually uses the metsorioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome convince his friends believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest baseball fan like myself even liked the final scene features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods some may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script lot of leeway and let us face it it is darn cool way end the there are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency keep you on your toes and as result the movie avoids growing stagnant the other major thing appreciate about frequency is the handling of the fatherson relationship quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily it is rocksolid job from both actors the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react being able communicate dead relative or future descendant watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you pretty good idea of how answer that question the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial the rest of the if we do not believe in the characters we do not care about the outcome of the thriller plot here we do care because we like the lead actors also liked some of the supporting cast members elizabeth mitchell gets stuck two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably andre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john he has lovely scene in diner in he tries explain the situation julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused perhaps the only thing did not like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during the cameras focus goes little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard but that is only because the had already earned poignancy without resorting cheap tactics freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as guy movie since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable who

blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up his potential as one of hollywoods premier leading men blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel it it is very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well although at few points thought was watching music video as opposed movie the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story but at times things seem get bit muddled and the writers appear want do too many things at once that really does not take away from the story too much but it does hurt it little bit blade snipes is half man half vampire his mother was bitten vampire when she was pregnant him and as result he has many of the classic traits of vampire including thirst for human blood that must be kept under control special serum quenches his blood lust blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother but this is not as easy as it seems because the vampires in blades world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires where do vampires get money well in blade they run multinational companies in order finance their vampire organizations personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run vampires be very clever idea and great addition the movie blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff maverick in the vampire community he is not content live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means insure its superiority he has managed translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an allpowerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable it is up blade see that this does not transpire admittedly blade is style over substance through and through the story is relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from movie of this type this is not that is going win accolades for its performances and the actors know this the movie is played for fun and nobody seems think otherwise it is popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise blades production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done although the mtvstyle cuts did get on my nerves after while during long sequences blade is fun movie an interesting take on the vampire genre this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century fresh outlook on life very cool,1.0
the truman show paramount pictures running time hour minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed peter weir after long wait jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it the big screen in case you have been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven his life seems so perfect however because it is controlled christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of that is right burbanks life is being broadcast live the american public and seahaven and all it is inhabitants are inclosed in massive sound stage the takes the jerry springer format one step too far an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter dumb it down and appeal the lowest common denominator luckily the remains sensible enough appeal all ages yet never seems be dumb carrey movie talking of carrey he is perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career his character is reinforced stanley ipkiss from the mask and is completely suited carreys persona he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey he is not completely dramatic like the promises however ed harris brings an extreme intensity christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show quiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer unfortunately he is barely in the and for the first hour dosent appear at all also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia she plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed the sidelines just when the audience is used her the supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect it is creepy the philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used great effect during the peter weir keeps the going clearly having fun the is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card although it is slightly slow begin about half an hour into the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the is on roll sadly though the is practically over when the is in full steam also concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous was disappointing the screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca delivers an entertaining script and manages keep the plot in trim while christoffs plans keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line would have been easy for niccol do also there is some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show overall the truman show is excellent entertainment certainly different from the usual crap produces it should be viewed everyone it offers something every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed overall rating review david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes,1.0

since the dramatic picture has undergone certain change of style now instead of emphasizing feelgood stories replete characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as schindlers list shows most of todays mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience that is why pictures like october sky are throwback the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such welcome relief in contemporary cinema the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal teenager in the company town of coalwood west virginia it is wellknown fact that the only boys make name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up work in the coal mine the mine is run homers father chris cooper is not the place for homer however after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in homer feels connection the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing did drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins construct rockets the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things october sky is skillfully crafted and most of that credit must go director joe johnston johnston whose career in the industry includes everything from directing wellknown titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down an uncredited role as death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what he is doing here he molds characters are true life and also fun watch into plot that is straightforward and robust he does not push any barriers but instead adopts conservative style of filmmaking enhances the films charm his finesse brings out elements might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homers mother and father the cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles laura dern jurassic park lends strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need her role is instantly likeable chris cooper the horse whisperer as homers father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity the movie he is definitely driving force in homers life and his more humane moments give the piece certain dynamic that is commendable the script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in lighthearted manner there are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need come up an emotional plot twist it highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps october sky should be success audiences although it does not have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she is all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards it is welcome change the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see,1.0
a big surprise me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such dumb idea really had no hope they replaced him just fine not john goodman he did not do much of anything but the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is evan bonifant who is ten this was another of my fears for the but he is really good dancer and plays mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all am quite pleased that there were less car pileups because they meant less music and john landis seems have lost interest in the whole thing there is few early crashes and then one huge pileup but after that it all stops it is just the music one of my problems the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but there is no problems this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up the exception of johnny lang who cannot sing all the musicians do great job the only real problems had was the special effects these were superfluous and waste of money since the is not doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel want see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities comhollywoodacademy remove no spam reply drive carefully but recklessly mama childs toy the only excercise take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter otoole,1.0

city we watch them struggle cover the horror while trying remain professionally detached however they are human and question the reason behind it all why no one cares and how they can get out stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy henderson realizes that he cannot save the world but he can help few it is wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had suffer through the denis learysandra bullock disaster two if sea woody harrelson continues prove that he is one of the finest most versatile actors of his generation harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter heart of gold allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through

successful career americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place for those who do not have full understanding of the history of the conflict the

many people dislike french films for their lack of closure while possibly shallow have often had desire for sense of epiphany or at least resolution in the films view there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of passiondenying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil stephane daniel auteuil is master violin maker he is passionless about all that surrounds him except his craft and the music his craft is responsible for producing even the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted the fact that stephane permits maxime win close squash matches in the beginning of the movie stephane is closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man camille kessler emmanuelle beart is master violinist and the new love of maximes maxime is so much in love camille that he plans and does leave his wife like stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion her violin and the music emerges when stephane and camille meet there is recognition of bonding both individuals however whereas camille submits the wild interplay of emotions she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted him stephane ignores his feelings for camille the audience cannot help but see is present as the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another these two people very similar approaches life initially react their new circumstance very differently stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering nervous breakdown due the inability consummate their relationship however their approach each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation the audience is led believe that stephane may have been genius as violinist as well due his relationship master violin teacher however apparently he could not be violinist due his intolerance for flaws in his playing consequently stephane becomes precision craftsmen the instrument and no longer plays in contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier however the aid of her manager she has progressed being almost one of the worlds finest successfully submerging herself her playing during the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle meet the challenge of their new emotions stephane attempts remain unchanged however we do see subtle hints of his transformation one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash the development of all of the characters many of is not included in this synopsis is incredible american movies rare exceptions have not and would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development in its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including death is further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is auteuils credit that he manages maintain this uncertainty this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are find the ending appropriate unfortunately found the last ten minutes led up the final scene be very unfulfilling this portion of the is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished unfortunately there is hurried and almost soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best have ever seen the directing in this movie is wonderful the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part great sincerity and warmth emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful and needless say must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful besides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie have is that the movie is almost too cerebral almost left the sense little happened because almost all the changes occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations they end as part of the one question am left is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed have several possibilities believe the movie hints at but am unsure of the director is espousing in summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop relationship in the process we see their attitude towards life and other people in itself do not believe un coeur is complicated movie where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture however bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it,1.0

footloose has only one goal in mind reel in an audience cheesy sentiment and feelgood antics and hate admit it fell for it the movie is about teenager bacon who moves small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned the local reverend lithgow he ends up falling for the preachers daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama there are virtually no surprises and the writing is secondrate so why did enjoy it so much for one thing the cast is great kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role we are rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon does not play him as the rebel without clue sort yes he does rebel but he is also polite when he needs be and he never broods the rest of the cast is equally impressive john lithgow seen here playing normal guy for change is playing man who would normally be flat out villian but lithgow plays him as concerned father who is trying do what he feels is best for his daughter the end of the we feel genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character another nice touch is the music we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen is filled sexual innuendos but that is not true at all the title track performed kenny loggins is upbeat and fun during the final sequence was overcome the urge get off the couch and start dancing of course soon realized that would be little pathetic anyway footloose is charming little surprise do not let the premise prevent you from watching it it sucked me in and it will do the same you,1.0

meet joe black reviewed on nov starring brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani in meet joe black brad pitt plays death that is all that really needs be said but nevertheless will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in cave plot description death decides take holiday what all the rigors of soulcollecting and all and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it is like be human death assumes the body of brad pitt and from there much trouble ensues for one thing deathaspitt falls in love hopkins daughter played claire forlani obviously this enrages hopkins because really what can death offer besides eternal damnation of course there is also subplot about forlanis exboyfriend she dumps him for pitt trying take over hopkins company meet joe black runs just under three hours have always thought that such obscene running times should be limited historical epics meet joe black is neither historical nor is it an epic though get the feeling martin brest the director desperately wants it be every single scene in the movie goes on about minutes too long and the ending takes about minutes longer than it really should severe editing job could have made this movie excellent instead of just good is what it is pitt an actor normally loathe is actually quite engaging as death believed his performance and could see why forlanis character would fall in love him have agree roger ebert though who found it hard believe that an entity that is been around for all time would not know what peanut butter was that has nothing do pitts performance of course but it is little distracting hopkins gives his usual excellent performance he is able portray the angst of man who knows he has very little time left without making him an obnoxious whiner and in her first major studio role claire forlani is surprisingly good she has sweet tenderness that allows the audience instantly root for her so meet joe black is good movie hampered it is ridiculous running time had the been cut an hour or so have no doubt that would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review,1.0
call it touched demon gregory hoblit is fallen is serial killer movie an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact there is even little twin peaks be found here albeit the lions share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although it is consistently interesting it is not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins sing time is on my side as he is taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese was not normal psychopath he was the host body for mythical dark angel named azazel and reeses death azazel is free hop from body body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they are up against the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini newcomer the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland do not have clue and as result they are in mortal danger as depicted hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is dark dreary place gothic city rather than modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark appear is not the liberty bell or independence hall it is genos steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where it is easy believe that fallen angels walk among men fallens plot is brimming potential not all of is realized somehow would have expected more frightening tale emerge from something this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the also boasts chase sequence of kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors play azazel the best is far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems be enjoying himself although his role for most of the is relegated that of burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the it is not that he is bad per se but he is not very interesting there is no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his lifeordeath chess game azazel approaches the point of checkmate expected be more on the edge of my seat than was washingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this never felt sense of urgency however at least washington was believable is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindlers list and donald sutherland be fair the flaws in their characters are not all actingrelated neither stanton nor gretta milano are wellwritten that said however there is nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work both appear be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution the is one of advancing the plot rather than developing multidimensional individual narratively fallen has few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds convoluted gamelike structure it uses denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like like the night sometimes you come face face yourself become little hard swallow in addition fallen is saddled the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced numerous movies and tv shows like touched an angel however despite the negatives am still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected it is not often that plot development takes me surprise the way this one did at time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages buck the trend and redeem itself this is not great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it is reasonably entertaining way spend two hours and whatever you do do not walk out on the before the end credits have begun roll,1.0
