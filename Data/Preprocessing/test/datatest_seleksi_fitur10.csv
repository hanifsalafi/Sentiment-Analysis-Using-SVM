therere so many things criticize about do not know where start recommendation turn off your brain do not be like me decreasing the rating everyday because think about it too much comet is about strike earth causing catastrophe similar the extinction level event l that wiped out the dinosaurs what follows is the story of presidents bid think for the good of his people rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and team of astronauts on the ship messiah save the world firstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the corny and stupid be honest was more moved the trailer than the itself is not saying much mimi leders followup the peacemaker is equally incompetent all the big stars wasted perhaps am just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed far superior thriller the assignment it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives however the simply fails on that note the effects are wornout the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials she is still making good money though a leonis unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast but the suffers from too many characters that do not need be explored robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freemans president is restricted well righteous president means he is not interesting at all leonis character is the only appealing one and is played reasonable conviction but rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued the director and screenwriters warning spoilers included but lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway plot holes plot holes plot holes now l is threatening exterminate more than of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there where is the logic leder could have at least made it plausible and then it turns out that only few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims the was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing also fail see how two teenagers carrying baby would be the first climb up the mountainhill even motorbike for headstart it is unlikely that the dust will take just two years settle but that does not really matter building caves was strategy mentioned in dr strangelove proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years now that is more practical use for caves what is the point of living in caves there is no unlike dr strangelove any radioactivity outside restrict exposure how do plants grow if humans have the technology keep plants alive in caves there is no reason why they cannot do it in the open the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves obviously this means that the other countries were informed long time ago and you cannot be serious say that nobody leaked the news the media in an important mission like that of the messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that is not sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless say tens of kilometres this is not deep impact it is frivolous cheap impact but even all that some overacting and rating it is still watchable just do not think about it okay,0.0
do not let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes vain attempt at that any moves glamorise his life has an annoying tendency do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much makeup on man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well let us fantasise onwards an assume that he was bit of flirtatious playwrite who falls in love beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me believe that he had wet dream and that is how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but guess my version probably would not draw crowd or make dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need do is read his work in order find his soul think not as for the oscars were they deserved this movie think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over more polished cate but guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you,0.0
it is good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan because titan e is proof that does not have clue how do it do not know what this is supposed be about from what can tell it is about young man named kale who is one of the last survivors of earth in the early st century who unknowingly possesses the key saving and regenerating what is left of the human race that is fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie but there is no payoff the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want destroy for no apparent reason so in the process we get lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake stick at there is so much pointless scifi banter it is too much take the galaxy here is total ripoff of the star wars universe the creators do not bother filling in the basic details makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring despite the fantastic animation and special effects it is just not an interesting movie,0.0

writing screenplay for thriller is hard harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun harder than building bridge over troubled waters and incidentally whole heck of lot harder than writing movie review thrillers are all variations on theme you have smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has goal he has meet you have noble and brave good guy who has protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner this simple formula can lead classic movies like north northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in black the fugitive or air force one or it can lead utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror is anyone else getting depressed here point is it is not enough follow the formula you have got throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version something surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals this is hard thing do but it is absolutely necessary in every way without that something extra whether it is great plot or wellwritten screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails that is why the jackal all its starpower all its budget all its hype gets big fat bruce willis is the bad guy the jackal legendary killer for hire richard gere is the good guy former ira assassin vendetta against the jackal the jackal is trying kill someone gere is trying stop him will gere be able stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal will give you three guesses and the first two do not count there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say yourself wonder what happens next the script for the jackal is not ripped straight from todays headlines it is ripped off straight from an episode of millennium throughout the movie we learn what the jackals plans are and how he intends accomplish them no surprise the fun of movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing clever plan foil the bad guy instead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackals plan just as if he is frank black or more likely just as if he is been handed copy of the script and we never get more than superficial clue as why gere has had this flash of insight it is like geres character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem know it and just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important what he is trying do or not what is more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly supersmart professional terrorist who never makes mistake comes down major case of the stupids as for the performances bruce willis manages get through the whole movie without wisecrack is major achievement but not enough reason see the movie his disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmers in the saint richard gere is made talk the entire movie in an irish accent detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything it is not but it is sad that will not use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot kill sneakers writing good plot and good screenplay like said is hard but it can be done it was not done here it is our job as consumers reward good screenplays and denounce bad and uninteresting ones do not go see this movie you will only encourage the producers make more just like it instead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or fire safety video for crying out loud anything other than the jackal lives up its name gnawing the dead bones of other better movies,0.0
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities the bestselling story speechless is not based on the romance between presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin in fact the script was in development well before still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes critical difference no it is not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers it is that carville and matalins story is actually interesting speechless is limp poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy speechless is set during new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is sitcom writer brought in punch up the republican candidates speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julias studreporter fiance christopher reeve and series of stunts continue prove that alls fair in love and politics the standard formula for movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they are crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism it is noble attempt shake things up but unfortunately it just does not work part of the fun of watching sparring in romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know they are attracted each other and we are left waiting for the campaign end so they will admit that they love each other already there is such herkyjerky feel the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cannot prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and those performances most of their scenes together the problems begin their initial courtship does virtually nothing establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is wiseass davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens them seems matter one bit in couple of scenes like quiet moment sitting at fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however they are just actors spouting lines you keep waiting for little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise removing all the punch from speechlesss politics the setting seems perfect for high energy battle of the sexes partisanship thrown into the mix but that is never the tone that underwood is going for he wants warm fuzzy romance compatible marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score and the campaign should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background it might as well have been story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed enjoy robert kings previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so had some hopes for speechless but while there is wit in the words this is script was probably much better on paper on screen it is still paper thin,0.0
teenagers have lot of power in every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand the formula is very simple you make big name young actor or actress sex appeal you add high school environment that features everyone from prom queens math club nerds and then very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in minutes the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste its money on almost any set in an environment they can relate and most importantly they dont care judge films quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office but she is very much dismayed her position in life there is nothing she wants more than be reporter and go out into the field where she can play more active role in the chicago media so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john reilly the two of them are both stricken horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her be an office worker and not reporter however since this is aimed at teenage audience little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves high school specifically she is become an undercover reporter at high school enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them dont think that need even begin explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so wont the movie develops into josie trying find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of dork she truly was and she appears be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love stories between both student jeremy jordan and teacher michael vartan show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this is actually quite amusing typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor one scene in particular features certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still dont recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying scenario from in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful watch she is required play her character on two levels having some very black and white transitions and although some scenes are written be particular shades of gray she seems hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone an obvious love interest on ferris wheel and is expected him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems be limited playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance emerge out of this otherwise bleak david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and as central character he gets take on his own miniplot is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed in dazzling cherryonthesundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the hit risky business never been kissed is mediocre at best the predictable plot has become so overplayed in that it is sickening watch time and again and this is no exception the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be success because teenagers will pay see any trash,0.0

from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong at reagan high four girls are sitting on top of the world courtney shane played rose mcgowan holds the title of meanest most disrespectful soul in the school everyone hates her but everyone envies her due her popularity courtney is the leader of her clique also includes julie played rebecca gayheart liz purr played charlotte roldan and marcie played julie benz are the other three in the group it is lizs seventeenth birthday and julie courtney and marcie concur that they will play seemingly innocent prank on her but the prank results in the death of liz just like stupid teens in any teen directed such as this one the foursome decide cover up the death make it look like murder committed someone else and also just like in other teen directed movies one of the four do not agree hiding it this time that character being julie and finally just like in other teen movies there is witness outside the group trying hide the truth this time that character being fern mayo judy greer who is subject many cracks from courtneys group as well as the entire school from here jawbreaker turns into predictable tale of revenge bad morals and at least trying do the right thing not only is the script weak on whole the acting is horrid thanks large amount of the main cast judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional annoying character as she overacts every line she has also on the bad side of acting is julie benz almost falling the annoying factor that greer delivers on the positive side of acting rose mcgowan performs well here but does not match her wickedly clever performance as tatum in scream mcgowans role is annoying but this only adds the she is wickedly mean and even though she wellwritten character you downright hate her faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart who is always exceptionally believable as her roles when the script feeds her one or two dimensional character she turns it into three always putting strong emotion and power into her roles gayheart is not given as much do here as she was in urban legend but you can still get strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout hardly throwing anything for the viewer get absorbed in we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident and get into things that do not have anything do the actual the beginning and ending are strong it is just the middle that needs lot of help during the body of the movie it is undeniably repetitive never progressing towards conclusion nothing grab the viewers interest is around and the same extremely annoying song plays over and over again jawbreaker tries get off on the same time of humor used in the clueless but falls flat the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off bang all in all horrible disappointment the bottom line the tagline reads even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside yes that is too true no matter how good this may have looked it fails deliver,0.0
well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year was not good this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite from the opening credits had good feeling this would be bad and well guess was right bad excuses for acting horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is terribly unfunny movie that does not work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give good performance the two cameos brooke shields and mariah carey are also good brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances date here is the stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton man who has just broken up his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years jimmie decides that he wants bring their relationship little bit up he really does not realize that anne thinks he wants marry her what he wants never did catch so he proposes in really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad he of course tries apologize but nothing seems help any then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie million dollars as long as he marries before the next day at pm now jimmie must find anne and try marry her get the money and because he loves her or get married someone else get the money itself leading an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves bad taste in our mouths ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy date that has no real big laughs even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser are not even good the plot was good idea but the script would have have been written in less than five minutes and five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing do not help things any even though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even remotely good or funny performance here and wanted boo and throw my pop at the screen get rid of him rene zelweggar is different story and gave charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being total huge washout her sister played marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed up in funny little performance as bigheaded mogul who after while became routine and old one really cannot help but think that we have seen this stuff before it is not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going happen due do its cliches and typicalness the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact does not work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act save her soul and this could be the only of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying great deal he seems held back and really does not get into his character much and after even the first minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just me seems like he is trying another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving why the filmmakers would want waste such cast in such bad movie such bad acting and dialogue is question only they will know maybe they thought it would become hit or critical success and sometimes do not agree other critics on movies even from the trailers for this they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based on the silent seven chances am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this as good date movie most who see this will want pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being terrible movie the bachelor is well terrible movie it has nothing worth recommending therefore really cannot recommend this movie did not have good time and laughed only three times the running time of the movie is minutes is wayyyy over time and needs be shortened at least thirty minutes parts of it seems go on forever and parts of seem not last enough time being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they give up on filmmakers,0.0
my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air sure would seen them all at least once but could always count on at least few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb antifans still have the i s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness think of the i as what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here nononsense old fart who looks disdain at the younger generation and loves give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic in this election year am more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters he gives each one different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up the produced and directed jack webb card pretty much goes without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason was wondering if there would even be plot certainly would have been entertained an hour and half of trademark webb rants but the i gives us more much more webbs mission is make man out of private owens the local screwup the captain gives webb three days convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers webb or owens remains unanswered this of course gives webb an excuse focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life living hell for those of you who have not been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching heres reprint of typical monologue of his cannot duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what am talking about now you listen me youngster someday you will wake up fighting on beach and you will pray god somebody does not get killed because of your foolishness have got headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours you are gonna turn around and will be standing right there could not write down all the reprintable dialogue from the i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but tried include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from hard days work going the local bar where he orders tomato juice he meets woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from typicallystimulating conversation webb flirt his archrival another marine i webb marches over the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of dame do you think you are bogart he as not the other i gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses the girl he is damn good i guess am just little jealous join the club we are all jealous of jack webbs way women is showcased even more amusingly in later scene as webb finds his way the womans place of employment lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me talk you in _here_ he exclaims no doubt intimidated the barrage of bras the woman goes off help customer leaving webb fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here you are man are not you he does not reply but you know he is thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small must be one of those children everyones been talking about this poor girl scarred for life her early encounter jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions he is responsible for the movie does not focus too closely on webbs romance it also continues the owens subplot probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon spend the entire night searching the ground for flea owens killed during one of their drills after two privates hatch scheme present webb the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed male or female owens replies male sir webb yells the platoon this as not the one that such scene along the rest of the movie was intended be taken seriously defies comment but we know it was all presented the utmost seriousness when title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie the exception of owens were played actual marines someone wanting parody this movie could not do more comical job than webb did it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day

ah and was going along so well too she is all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie have seen so far this year and quite frankly doubt will see anything equally bad at least hope do not see anything equally bad she is all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played freddie prinze jr who accepts bet transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular that right there is problem how many times have we seen this storyline as cook comments near the end of the it is kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution of course had the filmmakers attempted try something new this material the wellworn storyline would have been device propell the movie forward as it is though she is all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula push it ahead there is not one original or interesting character in the either and if that was not bad enough there is not one good performance featured the star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible usually do not like get so personal but in this case think it needs be said cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks be having as miserable time as was was never convinced that she was nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary the movie seems be saying it is better be popular than be who you are as for freddie prinze jr an actor ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here he coasts through the on socalled charm and never establishes real character kieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook and for some indiscernable reason he is got hearing aids no explanation is given and they are never brought up were we supposed feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids do not think so that single element of the was one of the most offensive things have seen in movie in long time she is all that sucks that is what it boils down it is not entertaining and it is not even good time passer the hour and half running time goes slower than minute hairremoval system informercial and what is worse it sends out bad message teens it appears be telling them hey it does not matter if you are happy the way you are that is unimportant if you want truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like bubbleheaded moron ugh,0.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for gala premiere this highlyanticipated rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence the picture and good reason this is joyless exercise of held together barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is catastrophic mess immediately invites comparisons last years case study in style over substance joel schumachers muchloathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad karatechopping emma peel immortalized diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same cannot be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they are on board sinking ship at this rate usuallysplendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow strange days the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they are no fun watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began alleviate the boredom considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose go instead that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spoton english accent if nothing else it would at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such as it is involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation his climatecontrolling contraption they also sip lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable blatant postproduction tinkering it is clearly evident that the picture has been cut shreds the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed the buffoonish maniac it is all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who is onscreen barely long enough register an impression approaches the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable hide his disinterest at least it all looks good this is genuinely handsome production fine costume design anthony powell and crisply shot roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order depict this great britain there are handful of striking visual moments in the including an attack swarm of giant robotic bees and nice shot of steed and peel finding way walk on water but the is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail stir interest or raise pulse rates the time the films climax had arrived my interest was not the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer savvy piece of work ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature itself the first promo made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it is everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining crushing disappointment the is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful be savoured as gleefully bad too polished overlook its deficiencies there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but sure hope not,0.0

star wars episode the phantom menace director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime min us distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright nathaniel atcheson fellow critic once stated his belief that reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review have attempted obey this rule in recent months but do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who goes see the phantom menace brings baggage in them the original star wars trilogy means so much so many people for me they calibrated my creativity as child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well am too young have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that does not make me any less dedicated it on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on very short list of why love movies when heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series got exited when first saw screenshots from the well over year ago embarked on yearlong drool of anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving was ready see the but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just be the first ones in the theater was tired of hearing about it was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever went kfc or taco bell just wanted see the movie reader do not misunderstand did not have an antihype reaction the hype was unavoidable understand and accept the hype it is just what happens when the prequel the most widely beloved films of all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace knew there was problem who are these jedi knights asked why are they churning out stale dialogue machinegun rapidity why are not these characters being developed before their adventures why is there special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire these were just some of my questions early on later asked where is the magic of the first three films and why am looking at my watch every fifteen minutes the end of the was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star wars take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you are left what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time it is an embarrassment looked desperately for scene in character is explored or new theme is examined or special effects shot is not used there are few of each but they are all token attempts the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for movie and pretty good showcase for digital effects this is not what wanted see did not want leave the phantom menace headache and bitter taste in my mouth but did the story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has line in the and their attempts liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of bureaucratic war the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking up jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best they head tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august quigon knows that the force is strong young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy them on their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines register as characters there is not anything particularly wrong this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we do not learn one single thing about quigon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this well imagine he did not have one that is why he feels like plot device this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why he is recently retired from do not blame him honestly obiwan character was really looking forward learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines so anyone hoping see the engaging young actor in great performance is urged look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie things start pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the and lloyd does thoughtful job the role was also hugely impressed the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin says goodbye his mother found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages give little depth character where no depth has been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters have ever had endure but he is more interesting than most of the humans as soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over it is back the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes have seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one have seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint cannot say that did not find the effects original because did the final battle between darth maul obiwan and quigon is visually exceptional as is most of the but also found the effects deadening and tiresome my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through digital sky and wanted that go away cannot we have one stinking scene that is not bursting at the seems special effects shot got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that really just wanted go outside and look at physical landscape for few hours and then there is the question of magic what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi have feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction think it comes right down characters there are none here longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine were not that high simply wanted that showed me the roots of the films that grew up loving story that had few characters and few great special effects instead got two hours and fifteen minutes of lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show do not hate the phantom menace as much as resent it would like forget that it exists and yet cannot it is here stay can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they do not then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series,0.0
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting come grips their shared histories and possible futures is fascinating topic finding an allstar cast for such is stroke of genius combining all that threetime oscarwinning director robert benton of kramer vs kramer and creating decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment in yet another noir mystery set in how many of these have we seen during the past few years the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable watch and the story goes nowhere over harry ross paul newman is washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying figure out how live what remains of his life he is screwed up things pretty well had wife and daughter now am drunk and is at crossroads couple of years ago he traveled mexico bring back mel reese witherspoon the underage daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives them the ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something wake him up fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love catherine jack is in even worse shape than harry he is dying of cancer only year live things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry drop off sealed manila envelope for him instead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is himself full of bloody holes this unsettling event gives the former detective project throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband years before through series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer rosss former cop buddies exlover and wouldbe sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it it is noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about the only surprises are exactly whose face fits role in the scenario the time they show you it does not matter the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship rubin giancarlo esposito partner wannabe these scenes are obviously designed be comic relief however they are neither rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it is not explained or did not care enough at that point remember running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant mirror his questions about whether he is still able perform it is also not funny does not connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course on the positive side it is often enjoyable watch the seasoned actors on the screen the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs newman is grand actor but does not seem quite suited the dark style he is bit too clean and understated come across as desperate and down and out hackman also lowkey is believable but lacks sparkle sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional the actors do what they can lame dialog but they cannot pull the out of the hole it is dug for itself james garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always treat but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like am glad they did not shoot your pecker off the best part of the is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the does not run very long before the audience realizes that it is hopeless the only reason for watching is the actors it reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed make everyone ignore the films problems in better world there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better of course we do not live in that better world but you could make yours little nicer choosing different movie,0.0
martial arts master steven seagal not mention director has built career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger he is also the most consistent individual in today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art am sure the guys good and he seems like nice guy on talk shows although tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although kinda liked under siege of course this one as change has message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blows up lot of stuff and kills bunch of people so why do watch his crap usually do not will never and you can hold me this will never pay see this mans movies unless and only unless he is in supporting role e executive decision and would definitely pay if he dies e executive decision but this one has special place in my heart this does not mean it is good or that even liked it this was the last movie watched my deceased uncle and we had one hell of time ripping it apart la mystery science theatre and this was couple years before had heard of mystery science theatre in this one seagal plays worker for mining factory set in alaska and run the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played an oscarwinner give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine wants do something his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks up him in what seems be the typical speech all the vain entrepeneurs what his new fire down below another message and caine has him bumped off or does he seagal is rescued some inuits and falls in love one of them played joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caines cliched henchmen played here lot of overacting john mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on voyage take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech about how he does not have any options but blow stuff up he even goes as far as say do not want kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is have no problem violence am huge john woo fan but he paints his films suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking either telling him his big secret plan or saying corny line seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time devise of way do away them and does this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it did not take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summers con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message would not mind if this was message in the way that they present it you evidence but seagal has no idea how present where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewers mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we cannot take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind the environment he also goes ahead and blows up square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then at the end he spends good minutes giving speech just in case you did not get the message from the trailers what seagal does not realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but does not comfortably fit in his is filled the brim hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as petri dish as far as seagal and his acting he is rather boring he squints he kills period nothing else oh yeah there is corny oneliners am gonna reach out and touch someone of course he is the star and we are supposed root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and bunch of jerks michael caine who is great actor is just supposed yell and look cold he does it well guess but this is no alfie of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible and we even get small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid lee ermey from full metal jacket as hired assasin squad leader who gets say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins anyway conclude this all judge one of seagals movies is judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message makes it more excrucitating watch mean if you do rent it and do not reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minutes but have put it seagal for creating so bad that the last viewed my uncle was pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is watch and mock,0.0

_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies person could ever have sit through that does not have jean claude van damme in it could liken it the scifi cheese that was the productofchoice back in the early but that would be too much of compliment if there is movie theater in hell this is playing there hours day the story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of man who has been raised from birth be merciless soldier in nottoodistant ultraconservative future is there any other kind after years of desensitization at military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes ground fighter in series of wars all over the galaxy who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it does not matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks there is more we see todd as buff scarred adult now so accustomed the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him break sweat there is new wrinkle though todd and his brethren are declared obsolete and new batch of soldiers takes their place after losing sanctioned battle _dragon_s jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped flying icecube tray well that is what is looked like on remote garbage planet if you predict that todd meets bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together fight bunch of bad guys coming destroy them you are way ahead of the game the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster come strolling into frame any minute it is surprising that _soldier_ is the brainchild of _blade runner_ cowriter david webb peoples unlike that mindtwisting classic this contains just barely enough dialogue fill about three doublespaced pages add into the mix the _mortal kombat_s paul anderson inept direction and it is easy see how _soldier_ turned out so bad and the special effects remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars gary busey is in this movie nuff said _soldier_ is proof that still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults that this sad made it the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all now if you will excuse me have go weep for the future,0.0
it is sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it such is the case for the paul mayersberg _the last samurai_ though the blurb alludes jungle filled political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic middleaged japanese businessman named endo played john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel africa in search of his ancestor who went bring buddhism africa he hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher they are all kidnapped an african revolutionary guerilla witchdoctor aspirations conceal prearranged arms deal subsequently falls through congo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary the sword the end _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough be enjoyable it is merely _there_ the murky plot is filled subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all the is shot through all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are be expected from an american movie it is quite slowpaced only bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic most of the acting is fair the possible exception of congos girlfriend lance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery paid for this from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect overpaid for it if you are in the mood for samurai read clavell novel or watch kurusawa movie skip _the last samurai_ unless you are diehard henriksen fan,0.0

m the sequel mission impossible is james bond wannabe but it fails even come close that in wit humor and entertainment value it tries be spyromance movie but without any suspense the just looks like it is an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses it is that prefers techie gadgets anything human the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols the plays as if it was wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequences the was dull for threequarters of its time filled too many dead spots in its story garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed as for the action scenes they might look good those who are converts violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence makes it very difficult sit back and applaud without feeling put off the gratuitous cruelty seen i opens and closes fastpaced action scenes but it is hard get past the middle part just drags on in banal dialogue the looks as if it had been invaded computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it is megabuck adapted from popular hightech gadgetry tv series but its artistic success is an impossible task accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors star in it and it failed produce story that had any substance john woo broken arrow faceoff is good at doing car chases choreographed fights midair flips and kungfu kicks slomo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just cannot seem handle dialogue and suspense the star of the and coproducer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and looks more like yuppie than superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries carry off this macho role while thandie is not an actionfilm girl and seems like fish outofwater in this one their romance did not work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it was not convincing the opens dizzying speed perhaps the hope that befuddled audience is its best bet for success we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where scientist muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mentions that every hero needs worthy villain explains the films mythic theme as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in onedimensional gruff tone did not distinguish him in that role at least if the got the villain part right it might have had some fun this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on plane talking someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out be sean ambrose scott rogue member of the imf is cialike clone he steals the package the antidote peels off latex mask is replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan virus plague on the world and then sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible as convoluted plot as that had it was still superior this sequel woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character distorts the reality of the and makes it impossible for the make much sense next we are in mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when helicopter his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via rocket launcher pair of talking sunglasses hunt learns his next mission is retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed pick two regular imf agents help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames luther running highgadget computer but he also must get jewel thief named nyah hall thandie join his team he is told as an incentive recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped hopkins then signs off the tag line this message will selfdestruct in five seconds actually the departure of hopkins it was this disposable that actually selfdestructed at this point in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of jewel heist and subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of mountain road he also falls for her when this was only supposed be business deal and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants ck her the imf team then inject location tracer chip into her spot sean so she can go ck him as she leads them his hideout in the seaside of australia in he shares his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes colorless pedestrian script one that fails even be funny in camp way the terrorists who aim rule the world are interested in owning percent in biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan infect sydney the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock ethan comes the rescue of the world and of nyah his only conflict being who is more important save first ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds way penetrate security tight biotech company fight it out sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself the virus hinder seans getting it as the only way transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescues her doing stunt riding on motorcycle using kickboxing winning shootout throwing full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and being completely fearless and larger than life while he kicks everyones ass if was only entertained this could have lived it but this was so badly made that it was like watching highlight of basketball game seeing only the slamdunks but the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is criticproof and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made appeal all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy buy into,0.0

starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role not that cindy does that bad it is just that anyone who watches this knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability look drop dead gorgeous in any situation and in fair game most situations tend find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but am sure that that is just coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well that is just happy coincidence sure william baldwin is not bad actor unfortunately he just does not demonstrate it at all in this movie am not sure if that is because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying make cindys acting look good if it was the latter it worked cindy does surprisingly good job here in her first movie is not say that she does not have room for improvement although be fair cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema well am glad you asked that question cindy plays lawyer who some convoluted plot twists becomes target for former elite kgb agents why woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask the end of the movie you will not care the story is so contrived it is not funny anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as scratch might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin who is character max kilpatric police detective seems possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagals early films the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwins characters of the run from these killer russians is not all that bad of an idea it is just everything around that basic idea kinda stinks out loud the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes if was baldwin would hope this disappears as for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability unfortunately any she does have is obscured writing that goes beyond bad this movie was obviously written cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways capitalize off of her looks it is too bad they had not spent more time on half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all herself thank you very much unless you are huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is movie that will only disappoint you,0.0

at first glance thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents given triplebladed sword can shoot bad guys like gun his dying father talon vows for revenge eleven years later when he is established his own army the mercaneries he vows take back his kingdom along the way he meets up alana whose village is attacked drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped cromwell talon vows help and after series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother and several other prisoners only be captured himself in other words put on cross be crucified fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off using hidden dagger in the blade then everything ends happily unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds what would have been great is completely destroyed uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes never once does the story seem connect together it just jumps around repeatedly this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off cliff afterwards wait minute did not the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order invade ehdan he cannot do military force if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him and why does he manage take over ehdan anyway these questions are just never no never answered in the another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about be crucified during alanas wedding cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down alana he just tells her wait and then he just rides off in addition the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been great fantasy adventure even some attempts make it exciting few fire scenes battle scenes do not work it just completely fails altogether miserably the only good thing about this is its musical score contributed david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and billion times better than this is my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it ironically though before the films credits roll there is message indicating that sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only million critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and ataglance reviews called it confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore totally agree these reviews all right and hope that this piece of will be forgotten about there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer hope you get good laugh out of this review but am not laughing in fact my insults do not even come close the gruesome sickness that this gave me throughout its minute running time,0.0
this movie stinks although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the into the abyss knew was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color this might seem like minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is recruit on his first day of training or what about when brenner tells suspect that because he is in the military he does not have the right not answer his questions even though these rights were central military law well before the miranda decision how hard is it get someone familiar the military check these facts now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful sit through for example at the beginning of the paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating the local police investigating the death are openly hostile the military and they discover that brenner has been lying them about the killing but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him duh ultimately brenner gets assigned investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter young captain also assigned the post when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter does he use them generate suspect list and begin grilling suspects no his instinct is suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier will not even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime will just mention one final flaw brenner is investigating crime that occurred in georgia the rape occurred in west point is in new york he is under very tight and totally implausible hour deadline solve this case he needs discuss the rape psychiatrist at west point does he phone the doctor no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport new york question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns georgia again the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline you have been warned stay away from this one,0.0
it was not scary these are the first words that came mind after it was over when movie is called _vampires_ not scary are not words that should be associated it but that was not my only gripe john carpenter is name associated cuttingedge cinema as in the intense scares of _halloween_ _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able reach an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects _john carpenters vampires_ has barely enough substance slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan the is at first concerned group of roaming vampire slayers led james woods of all people like some sort of holy ateam they even have their own soupedup van the bunch invade and wipe out nest of vampires in new mexico shack their method is amusingly innovative the bloodsuckers are reeled out harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates motel room hookers and parties the night away their celebration is shortlived however as master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape their lives along woman named katrina sheryl lee although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide keep katrina for her psychic link the master vampire the rest of the movie is concerned the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith freaky marilyn mansontype who is on mission that dates back years along the way they pick up priest named guiteau tim guinee character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl upham in _saving private ryan_ some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but cannot remember most of it because often found twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen _vampires_ finally starts pick up about minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest only then does the begin even resemble carpenter flick but it is too little too late we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic come on we are dealing _the_ master vampire here interestingly last summers vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from comic book and _vampires_ from novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former more deliberate superhero flick woods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings that ohsocool stride and his motive for killing vampires take wild guess hint ______ killed his _____ when he was just _____ at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills mask its gossamerthin plot make up for this the movie resorts other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone getting woodies it can be argued that maybe wanted too much from this movie if not scary and gory wanted tense relentless and exhausting _john carpenters vampires_ is none of these can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan for the rest of you looking for good scare beware _vampires_ is no teeth,0.0
perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated condescending attitude his shtick was marked crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that she is kicking him out because he is been fired from different jobs over the last months he tries calm the situation saying maybe you will feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly cannot go the distance in fulllength feature dirty work is nothing more than sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically emotionally they have never outgrown their pubescent years is somewhat amusingly explored in beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid was unjust in giving you ticket then dump bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need come up in period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have heart operation their idea is start revengeforhire business where they will do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of live television shoot at nearby used car lot their presence is established but when lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go work exact their sordid brand of revenge default dirty work should treat us some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as prank phone call already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes very unfunny chevy chase as bumbling doctor gambling addiction but what is really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note self note self learn fight he says after getting beat up note self there is always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like we are just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live much like the television show for minutes we get one or two funny bits the rest of the story is just dead space,0.0

bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan pull something like this off you need have sense of wit and style heavy dosage of humor back up the process if the fright factor ever declines something like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the was tremendous fun the notable exception of wisecracking supporting player bats mainly plays it is premise for straightarrow horror judging the ridiculous premise this was not exactly wise move the movie attempts capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds but fails miserably done right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema unfortunately bats is prime example of formula movie done terribly terribly wrong the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience be will recite the following paragraph in manner that will reach the audience of individuals whom bats is aimed toward those guys in have made movie about bats these bats are not very nice because they eat lot of people boy are these bats ugly they are infected this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart they have got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all whole bunch of people in texas get killed so sheriff guy and scientist lady are brought in kill the bats they have big guns and other cool things fight them but the bats are pretty smart so it is sorta hard do the bats swoop down and they shoot at them make they go away for good but no bats is probably too violent for preschoolers the directed louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores on the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived lower expectations but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at few moments it becomes guilty pleasure the is poorly written poorly acted and executed glaring ineptitude even the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery be properly enjoyed the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype smalltown authority figure usually portrays he chomps on cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc the scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field meyer uses lot of technical terms designed make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated sharks in jaws everything revolving around bats is tired drivel desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities spruce it up the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw voices dubbed in later in fact that may have worked out better in the end take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy leon and you will have immediate deja vu he is the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief unfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny in the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch mccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread other bats the entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears be inconspicuously contemplating something else something like when is the damn movie going be over just want my money the bats are ugly must say there is the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the could have been but the absurdly stupid climax it is way too late in the game for decent recovery characters experiment in slaughtering the bats gunfire let us explore the logic there is this really very efficient way decrease the bat population you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only more of them this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats,0.0
the most interesting part of cannot hardly wait just happens be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the films sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the and at one point sits down on couch and looks totally bored the wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically mirror of what is going on them watching this we sit there wondering why we have even bothered see about long high school party we probably never felt the desire go in the first place would actually highly recommend this if it satirized all of this after all this is filled bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of went high school everyones here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and xphiles the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this shows them as superficial lame and basically as bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way making this into an admirable and even likable the as said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant everything however instead of sticking this perhaps even going bit further it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all bunch of moronic stereotypes only shread of humanity and realism and tries tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared andor identified them and if we did we certainly do not want revisit that state of being heres quick lowdown it is graduation and we follow bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did little bit of that and featured big outdoor keg party cannot hardly wait just opts for big indoor keg party and little bit of aimless driving albeit of the amwhiningbecauseicannotgetagirliwant brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who is been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared moment their freshman year over freaking pop tart now that she is broken up her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides go the party note he is written declaring his love for her in the hopes he will build up the guts give it her even though he is leaving for multiweek intensive writing program hosted none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and track record of what goes on it would not be able carry commercial let alone feature and because it is party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up ridiculous plan publically sabotage mike who is humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in bathroom do not ask kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed follow the laws of plot cliches from point point nary bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this is getting another is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not mention were extremely entertaining but john hughes films of the most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that managed not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this forgets satirize its characters and ultimately tells story about bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that it is all okay we cannot take this seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but will tell you some things did like liked the direction except for couple toooverthetop features like waytooglossy jump cuts it is like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage capture an altmanesque feel their from time time thing note though is too hokey really be admirable actually did like seth green for once in about decade when he played very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the however the character of denise really does not work the when really thought about she is far too witty and realized at least for the first half belong in this and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything delightfully satirical tone she is not just the cynic or the intellectual she is just very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the more but at least when she is on screen we can sit up and think ourselves well at least we will be entertained couple other things that just do not work mikes character who suffers an epiphany throughout the but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the in general the aimless bitchy driving preston try and get over his inability shack up amanda give me break and perhaps the one thing that just does not work at all jenna eflmans uncredited cameo as an angel just did not work but nice try basically the worst thing about this the real reason am giving this such low rating is because it refuses give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we would do we do not feel for these characters because for most of us we are not stereotypes going through the motions worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what it is portraying the answer for this is no nice try

the may be called mercury rising but that title does not describe the trajectory taken this motion picture routine thriller that combines government coverups cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story the hook that is supposed make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic however aside from giving actor miko hughes chance win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the comes across as nothing more than convenient plot device those expecting see even semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed mercury rising treats autism the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord alcoholism the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow do not know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond suspension of disbelief is no longer possible once again certain standby plot elements the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not good effect while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized too little tension and too much nonsense the story begins formulaic sequence in the tough fbi agent heart of gold art jeffries bruce willis is confronted his own failure unable resolve hostage crisis in time he is forced observe as two teenagers are shot death the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in closet after his parents have been gunned down the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player soon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just step behind them along the way they are helped the best friend who defies orders help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become love interest kim dickens why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player apparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called mercury make sure it cannot be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place sample of it in nerds puzzle magazine of course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is when he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa as result the coldhearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has be eliminated for the good of the country of course but he has not counted on the tough fbi agent heart of gold even though everyone in the audience has it is hard get worked up about routine thriller that does not do anything exceptionally well and does quite few things rather poorly for those who are desperate find elements of this movie like mercury rising manages manufacture tension from timetotime but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains are not that pulsepounding the climactic struggle is real hohum affair leads finale that is painful in its obviousness overall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing generate even moment that is not derivative or obligatory bruce willis star seems be fading this is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal willis is not terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does alec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace the films real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare who does as good job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about years younger mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and s marshals on the heap of pallid thrillers for those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been good year hopefully the advent of summer will change that until then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video and if you are determined see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may,0.0

godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie loose remake of the classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick has been written the brain dead in mind the script is not just dumbed down it is lobotomized godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone presumably the primary target group for this is teenage boys the demographic most likely shell out repeatedly see the same images of monsterinstigated carnage that is not say that females and other age groups are immune the special effects seduction they are just not as readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that mastery of computergenerated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability write and direct for actors stargate was financial success independence day was runaway hit and godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens it is virtually guaranteed at least million nice numbers for that could have been penned nottooprecocious grade school kid godzilla is not completely without merit although it is close there is certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly frankly while the special effects are competent they are not all that stunning there is nothing new here it is jurassic park meets aliens little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie take computergenerated visuals the next level godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring remain within comfort zone the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced crass formulaic approach disallows creativity how disturbing is it know that godzilla has been chosen close the st cannes festival worst of all godzilla is not even exciting the possible exception of mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there is not sequence in this that raises the pulse even the scenes dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawnprovoking independence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we are never sure who we are supposed be rooting for the green monster an attitude or the paperthin humans trying stop him the plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple he does some of the usual tourist things stops madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on walk through central park and takes the subway in the process he knocks over few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble traffic jams on hand stop him is an elite s army unit led slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man kevin dunn and biologist named nick tatopoulos who has theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually lizard grown enormous proportions as result of the radiation given off french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific in nicks words godzilla is mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind as luck would have it nicks old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is reporter based at new york tv station along her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides follow nick around as he trails godzilla then just when the military has rejected nicks theory about why godzilla is in new york member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that it is becoming boring the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started king kong but the big ape was only about feet tall he could climb the empire state building at ten times that height godzilla would be more likely knock it over godzilla contains few lame attempts at humor there is an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sitcom material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nicks last name properly and rather tame attack on critics roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the ebert the mayor of new york is played michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager eberts reelection slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york the siskelebert stuff is amusing the first time it is used but after while it grows tiresome and although the characters do not serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich does not want risk human performance upstaging his lizard that is not say that matthew broderick and jean reno are not capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they are not alist names then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed shine maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand present what is supposed be comic relief ultimately it does not really matter what or any other critic for that matter have say about the movie tristar has assumed that godzilla like all selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much criticproof it may also be wordofmouthproof those who want see the movie will see it no matter what write or their friends say so when go on record assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time it is like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences their smoke and mirrors it is probably too much hope that some day moviegoers will wake up and

recently one night young director named baz luhrmann could not sleep he tumbled out of bed and moved over the television where he watched mtv for an hour then he moved his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food then he took down volume of shakespeares work and read it cover cover never really paying attention the words or plot and then as climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button the result william shakespeares romeo juliet the worst ever made and complete failure though be fair an interesting complete failure the idea at the films core is make shakespeare appealing the crowds this is done moving the camera around at rapid rate so that we cannot see what is going on and filming the dialogue in voice over and shooting leonardo dicaprio like calvin klein model and making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion mean man this is the dude however have seen terrible films that are fun watch examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau that rule does not apply here this is that takes itself seriously that is it is major fault another problem was pointed out my friend alex who was singing songs leonard bernstein throughout the original play is powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and did not take sides here it is clear that we are supposed side romeo just look at the way they him from the begining he is our hero and this does not work and dicaprios awful performance does not help luhrmann never decides if he wants entertain us or enlighten us the result is mess you can feel him striving be something he is not he tries pull of mix in drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles he tries very hard key word tries oh look he is filming above water action from below pretty what does it represent why do people do ugly things scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if could never read the play again and keep straight face,0.0

humanities quest for knowledge never ends so team of scientists and filmmakers travel the amazon search for legendary indian tribe the party consists of anthropologist steven cale eric stoltz and the camera team consisting of terri flores jennifer lopez danny rich ice cube gary dixon owen wilson denise kahlberg kari wuhrer and warren westridge jonathan hyde early on their journey they meet paul sarone jon voight whose boat is stuck on the shore they agree give him ride the next village he claims know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out be snake hunter without scruples who only wants catch giant anaconda and sell it zoo we do not have wait too long for the giant snake she just had panther hors doevre and now is looking for the main course our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for dinner bell our anaconda is polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp enjoy so much for the first attempt catch her but who would want catch giant snake fishing pole our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake too bad that anaconda is just about strangle another member of the expedition one one she goes after the others eric stoltz is stung giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring whenever the leading lady shows up we are in for laugh the snake reminds us of favorite character of famous animated movie even if she should be an aweinspiring monster her attacks always follow the same plan one last hypnotic look she is looking at you kid then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts gush it down mostly we do not see the act of devouring but she looks nice when she wiggles away her bulging middle part whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted go zoo first and study some real snakes maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real the animatronics are somewhat more believable but that did not work for the strangling scenes do not go see the movie for the fx they are everything but uptodate the viewer who likes watch the end credits will see hisher surprise that snake expert was consultant for the team we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits but will refrain from naming it here avoid further damage its reputation the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling anyway what kind of audience is the target group for this movie hard say this cannot be serious horror movie or can it see for yourself,0.0
absolute power the new produced and directed clint eastwood attempts be thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff it is about as thrilling as lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written william goldman could have ever interested eastwood not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence continually underestimating the audience the gives us information we already know or dont even need details essential the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities masterful jewelthief played clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of powerful millionaire played g marshall while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced hide in the bedrooms vault there through twoway mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay their game of love quickly turns into violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman in self defense the woman grabs letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow she raises her arm stab again when she is fatally shot two secret service men the man he is the president of the united states of america where does the go wrong it cannot be the acting clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast but decent performances the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends be in the thrillersuspense genre the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone while setting up story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and doublecrossing it does not resolve it not one buildup of suspense is resolved an exciting climax rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness an example of this is very promising and tense buildup of scene in an attempt arrest clint eastwood the police have set up trap at small restaurant police officers are everywhere incognito of course at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing kill clint eastwood when he arrives all three parties are unaware of each others presence this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is trap will get himself out of this difficult position he will probably have brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut the police preparing for the trap the scene was resolved in less than seconds parallel the story line of catching the real killer is cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing house somewhere of course their relationship takes turn for the better during the adventure and they end up happy family again it is commendable that absolute power tries deviate from the mainstream suspense giving room for dramatic subplot however trying is simply not enough the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable everything this is not how could screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding be produced how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in project like this one am sad say that my respect for the actordirectorproducer has diminished substantially due this director quentin tarantino once said can make good movie out of any bad script director clint eastwood obviously cannot,0.0

bicentennial man is family without any external motive the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue make his point based on the short story isaac asimov it is supposed be science fiction story about robot who wants be human as you can imagine is very difficult starting in not too distant future the concentrates on wealthy family that buys an android help them the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides teach andrew all the things he was not programmed do soon andrew wants leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this can be described as disney version of blade runner that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible become human at what point can we say robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus did not take them very seriously when you think about it this is not really meditating on the question when is robot no longer machine but human being but tells story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as human being and only the society has troubles it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems this day no serious filmmaker has dared speculate about the future in more than years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination perform such difficult task columbus is the first have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back the late th century and then compare it the world we live in today you will see slightly bigger difference am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but it is even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion suppose it is possible watch this as some sort of bizarre fairytale but it is really hard robin williams is hidden behind and speaking in robotic way as always he does decent job as does sam neill but it does not really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into tiresome experience pretty much like last years meet joe black this is primitive and unresolved story is presented splendor and professionalism that it does not deserve great actors and talented crew have worked hard achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimovs time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed julius vernes leagues under the sea so cannot we accept this story as potential reality let us hope that next years i will be more rewarding,0.0
in the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this such grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved the avika goldsmans screenplay is such cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene another this coming on the heals of such marvelously written project as the client is such shock that it gives rise thoughts that the latter was fluke situations are developed and executed no thought of reason other that get the characters from one point another this is most glaringly brought point the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens be alfreds niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on cure for tragic decease contracted his wife dr freeze is injured during cryogenic procedure and becomes man who can only survive in sub zero environment now of course he has become terrorist intent on turning the world into frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little subplot escapes me if mr freeze wanted find cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want have her live in world no warmth this is indeed cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants breed form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins mr freeze in his plan start new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason have the defense mechanism she had been trying breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying be father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him say that his performance is workmanlike is be generous his best performances are still on r bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening his girlfriend played elle macpherson that it brings into question bruces latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last in the series now he is just spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted be batmans partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robins attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for boy around the age of his later flirtation batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in traditional sense chris odonnell once considered rising star successfully burns up on reentry this performance his robin needs nothing more than good spanking the less said about alicia silverstones performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines all the aplomb of dubbing actor for godzilla she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freezes imprisonment the guards are at least foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on it is almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing growing discomfort her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes mind this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage hire so many thugs only abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have have look no one can be an individual day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume this warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back it is tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaas and clangs associated the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this the special effects john dykstra and production design barbara ling are the primary stars of this and it is case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivys lair the batcave freezes hideout is set enough neon and fiberglass keep the epa in paperwork for years come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in dykstra and his team gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is good director one just has look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated and the client know that but batman and robin comes off as mated made for tv movie the has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent jello pretty look at but empty it is unfortunate that this even it is surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do the franchise kill it joel schumachers batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars,0.0
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting one of the best examples that now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new where the heart is this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman hitting the road her hick guitarplaying boyfriend in rustedout gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath plastic umbrella her unborn baby due in month stopping off at nearby walmart for quick rest novalees boyfriend decides take off and leaves her there novalee then decides secretly hole up in the walmart because she is not the brightest bulb in the stagelights wacky librarian keith david comes her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store then the she moves in family befriends everyone in town including ashley judds character who has five kids and still can work parttime as nurse fights off religious freaks survives tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds martha stewartesque house becomes an awardwinning photographer and manages always look like she stepped out of cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything her kid this is terrible the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again we get pathetic and ugly acting natalie portman who can do good work disjointed pacing of key scenes and time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot an embarrassing display of emotions the characters making the audience ill taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them write drama on par oprahs book club altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching very bad television miniseries and wishing it end only the remote is broken however the main problem the is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart no one ever seems find it in this piece of junk,0.0
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating review in the updating of mickey spillanes novel the jury hardboiled detective mike hammer is vietnam vet who drives shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice less pastels and has sworn off alcohol however he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at whim beyond that the updated retains little or no resemblance the original pulpy pageturner spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers the movie starts off bang howler of an opening credits sequence that is cheap steal from the james bond series complete cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same the murder of jack williams frederick downs onearmed detective and hammers best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jacks death and the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killers trail here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammers vietnam vet buddies and kinky sex clinic many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles for instance charles kalecki alan king numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into suave mob boss and more importantly hammers suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from runofthemill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books including version was made in but this differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due hollywoods production code although this takes the version of the jury closer the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the received the most criticism because it took this new license extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book rest assured the movie not only includes great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women it features one woman having her neck slashed set of twins forced strip before being stabbed death psychotic sexual deviant programmed the cia judson scott and another woman shot pointblank in the belly hammer himself no one would deny that spillanes writing has definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems take it step further giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of is played the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it is no surprise that the movie like the book fades black dead woman on the floor the jury had troubled production and was not wellsupported the studio that made it is one explanation why it did not do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made the script was written larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like it is alive and its two sequels and the stuff cohen wrote the script thinking he was going helm the project as well but he was yanked from the directors chair after only weeks worth of shooting because he was already over budget he was quickly replaced richard heffron who has worked for the last three decades on handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it shows in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie features numerous car chases shootouts and stunts but heffrons background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and fullfrontal nudity the jury takes on the air of madefortv quickie no real punch or depth but the problems in the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties the eighties because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammers character is central the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes do not have hammer in them at all consequently great deal of the texture of spillanes storytelling is lost the period updating turns out be detrimentally bad idea because much of hammers moral code is thrown the wind despite his characterization as hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently his own moral code the title itself the jury refers his antiestablishment notion of being his own law unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms but in any terms especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away that in the first three minutes showing him rolling in the sack the wife of client who had paid him find out if that wife was being unfaithful maybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammers character and is all accounts lousy way start the movie the blame for hammers character cannot be laid on assantes shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling he delivers fine performance spillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillanes books will have strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the hammers the rest of actors are most unnoteworthy the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in the jury were upandcomers who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had short stint on dallas in the mideighties only adds the madefortv atmosphere of the maybe someday someone will manage get the right elements together and make an effective rendition of spillane book but this is certainly not it,0.0

robin hood men in tights is another melbrooksproduced in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit unfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world it is in short one of the worst movies have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce the plot borrows heavily from the wellreceived kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves this is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used great comic effect mainly parodying scenes from the orginal movie mel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the launch several ideas into the air none of connect and none of are explained later on the movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed notice cary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley man who was captured in the crusades fighting king richard he escapes and joining man named achoo am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england reclaim his name and the throne for richard has been captured evil prince john played funny comic richard lewis he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham good adventure plot that is sadly unused elwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating neither actor has any good words work and the lines simply are not funny nor believable perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter man playing macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that really felt like leaving the theatre much of the audience continued look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre chuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rentawreck then from any dialogue whatsoever scenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined poor acting perhaps the largest problem the movie is that it is simply offensive the basic plot that robin has received key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny mel brooks as circumcisiongiving rabbi is also offensive me and others in the audience not all jewish either the movie simply tries hard trying be funny and and large fails the addition of blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive the only reason see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard he is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting if you cannot do not even bother watching this miserable,0.0
his successful books and movies michael crichton is doing well early successes westworld and coma and recent films such as jurassic park his films have been entertaining however he seems taken wrong turn somewhere sphere this million mess good director barry levison disclosure is dull long winded and huge disappointment considering the huge budget the all star cast and story crichton sphere is majorly disappointing the opens norman goodman hoffman psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash console the survivors however when he arrives he his told supervisor barnes peter coyote that he is actually investigating an spacecraft along goodman is mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone and ted fielding liev schrieber they investigate the spaceship find massive sphere inside meet an alien intelligence called jerry and basically weird crap happens unfortunately something went wrong along the way sphere the starts off entertaining enough but throughout this very long movie it just gets sillier and sillier the jaunts along from scene scene never fully explaining what is going on the actors and directing do not help either hoffman is on autopilot and almost seems embarrassed throughout the movie churning out dull lines and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie stone is useless displaying no emotion and fails convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman the only person who seems be having fun in this movie is jackson who is funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere but he is hardly in it and the end of the he is just as dull as hoffman and stone the same goes for peter coyote who hams it up as the officer but is then killed off halfway through the director barry levinson who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure messes up the drama and the action the drama scenes are quite frankly boring and the action scenes suffer from overkill levison throwing the camera all over the place much like the godawful speed the writing does not help much either although crichton is great plots he is terrible dialogue and practically every line in sphere is dud the speech is too simple was hoping it would be bit more intelligent practically every line is just stating the obvious none of it is smart also where the hell did the budget go the sphere itself is impressive and there is few nice special effect shots but where the million went is anyones guess there is giant squid attack in the picture but not once does the audience see the squid even though the has massive budget assume the picture was trying build up tension not showing the squid and if handled correctly it probably would but the whole scene is done badly and was just hoping we could see the stupid squid finally the has no idea what genre be levison cannot handle his own plot it leaps from hokey scifi horror and finally the shiningevent horizon psychological thriller and of course the is very much like the abyss although in it is defense crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released and is far superior this rubbish it is not all that bad though the plot is all right there is few jump scenes although nothing very scary and there is the occasionally interesting bit but overall sphere is big waste of some fine talent lot of money and potentially good movie not really worth seeing overall rating review david wilcock,0.0
director luis mandokis last was the superb serious drama when man loves woman but his luck has ultimately run out his latest picture message in bottle is the worst type of romance movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages dry out your eyes rather than tear them up everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso there is an absence of suspense and the ultimately moves at such very very deliberate pace as if it is trying make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes tedious bore sit through message in bottle begins theresa osborne robin wright penn single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper soon heavy research is conducted find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling the outer banks boating town in north carolina find out the specifics of the message of course garrett turns out be handsome rugged man around theresas age and played kevin costner she is immediately charmed him but hesitant unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died few years earlier do you think you know where this is headed most likely you do and would not call it giving away anything say that the pictures end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that did not buy for second if there are any positive things say about message in bottle it is that the performances robin wright penn and paul newman as garretts stubborn but loving father are far above par be in such wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city meanwhile costner has yet redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently it seems that such bad luck he would not want make another movie set near water but here he is again one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on stormswept sea the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems always get stuck the friend roles here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune the first half of message in bottle plays like humdrum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends great deal of time getting know garrett dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining usually am the type of person practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the is no doubt trying develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking when the main characters of have very little of interest say each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble swear that while watching message in bottle felt as if had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality am not even familiar the novel this is based on nicholas sparks always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly the constraints of the triedandtrue melodrama the strip often seemed almost be in danger of tearing nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after this same exact problem occurred in last years very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar mean meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama city of angels although theresa is deeply touched the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding message in bottle of their own preferably before filming began it should have read memo screenwriters use you brain,0.0
i remember really enjoying this movie when saw it years ago guess my memory really sucks there is very very little that is funny in caddyshack the laughs are few and far between and what there are really are not that great caddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club michael okeefe plays said caddy why they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me the movie does not seem have real plot just series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast mug at the camera the only real story if you can call it that was subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against gopher who is ruining the course most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera painfully limited success bill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted the biggest waste of all is chevy chase who did not even crack smile on my face his characters lame zenlike approach golfing there are few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent carry the movie guess that is what you get for basing story around an unknown kid am not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen paper nothing about this movie works it would not have taken genius figure out that this thing was not going fly most of the scenes just could not possibly be funny it is as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world am sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness the golf ball were supposed be funny in reality they were painfully embarrassing watch there is scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking in her bikini olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny but for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack,0.0
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying prove that she did not kill her spouse the fugitive not quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays parole officer not us marshall clever huh oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed her own husband bruce greenwood who needed collect two million dollars in life insurance money not one armed man both movies are on video make the wise choice and pick the fugitive there are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable while serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice learning that her husband is still alive she decides serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary when the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught she is going back jail director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying convince the audience that libby misses her son every other scene we are given shot of libby staring and crying at his picture in an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby get up and do something all that is needed in this type of movie is short scene in libby tells herself or friend miss my son nothing more nothing less dr kimble of the fugitive did not look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was save himself libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed costar tommy lee jones winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his idomyjobwhethertheyareinnocentorguilty roles people still pay see his movies and he makes plenty of money so guess he was right though do not think he will win another oscar again the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous count burglary assault grand theft auto are some of libbys slipups the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you are innocent of the major crime hopefully criminals will not use double jeopardy as reference in court for why they are innocent that would just be plain stupid,0.0

man this was one wierd movie similar conspiracy theory in that it could not decide genre it is the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it let us just kill everybody from then on forget scifi this movie becomes horror what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever tricks or trying build up scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones seen it all before and knows when expect it the one thing that was done well was the lead up finding out about what happened the previous crew there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video the acting is not too bad at all considering what the actors had work anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue speak of there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had good experienced cast who deserved more work there was just nothing new here that any of us have not seen before in aliens or hellraiser,0.0
the king and a warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of woman who challenges the heart of king obvious results when anna miranda richardson british schoolteacher travels saim educate the kings martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something the greedy ruler meanwhile the kings prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots overthrow the king taking the throne the last and most predictable main subplot deals the kings son allen hong and his love for servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts his feelings and the ancient laws of saim not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of journal will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages elaborate on every detail the screenplay written arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler is based upon the play written richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc would cringe literally speaking of cringing did quite bit of this during the rather short is classic display of terrible filmmaking besides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical the sole song is used cleverly is getting know you is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors they have never been exposed unlike disney animated features the king and is songs do not add the and are as uneffective as could be take the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst you are being hunted dragon what do you do sing happy song martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives do not make positive believe it the terrible dialogue that the king has along his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the progresses no personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end and where does this characters personality change hey thought anna was supposed change him is not that the whole plot the prime ministers hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no another one of his teeth fell out hardyharhar he is supposed bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five would have cringed while watching him the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this is due not liking animated films hence why hate this movie because the king and is disgrace animation animated films such as the lion king and the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time the animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier take my mind off of the annoying king until realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds have not read the play or seen the oscar winning adaption but from what can tell the screenplay for the version completely butchers the play for the king and is never magical nor interesting if it was not for miranda richardson who voices anna feeling the king and could earn the title worst movie of the decade instead the king and will just go down as among the years worst the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs not even young children the target audience in this will enjoy it not the slightest bit,0.0

salaries of top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway thriller directed sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as courier for gangster one day she decides retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed professional assassins terri thompson being the actual star of the instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much be desired on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms bad name martin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway unfortunately he appears in this too little too late prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved be her last,0.0
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put lot of hard work in script worth about ten cents the script was written michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas he would rehash lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drugdealing pirates provide for few highlevel action sequences and explosions there are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make see the truman show for instance six days seven nights is simply waste let us see we have get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island so how do we do that well we will make her feisty magazine editor and we will make him crusty old pilot but wait she has have fianc that can be david schwimmer but wait if she has fianc how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone know they will get their vacation spot and then she will get called back yessssss so they will crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes shucks oh have got it we will throw in distracting subplot in her fianc has sex really attractive woman who acts like bimbo and then he can feel guilty then when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have kiss because otherwise nobody will want see the movie it will be vindicated action because her fianc will already have cheated on her then for no obvious reason they will accidentally run into pirates who try kill them oh yes feel so good about this story instead of using characterization propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable imagine that do not get me wrong six days seven nights is not boring picture ford and heche both do great job the sparks fly between them and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out the actors sheer force of talent almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring the screen and found myself laughing pretty hard schwimmer is also funny and manages milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get and reitman who has made some good films at least tries make things exciting even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb was prepared be pleasantly sidetracked the action sequences it is just when start think about the story that my contempt for this surfaces the picture feels like it is been hacked pieces would not be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely the ones that are here are as bad as they come think let out very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and would just like shake the producers the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script the is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying for instance take the subplot in the schwimmer character has sex the bimbo and then feels really guilty this is serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche kiss ford in script that lacks even glimpse of intelligent subtlety find it odd that such strangely insulting device ended up in the story this is summer movie season but that does not mean our movies have be dumb so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters when was in line for six days seven nights heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets that new harrison ford movie why did not she know the name of the suppose she just did not care what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures do not realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves good actors should sign good scripts and if insists on making flicks rake in cash they least they could do is assume that we would like spend our money on story worth more than ten cents,0.0
if anything stigmata should be taken as warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close one another of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst suppose should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but was not anything would lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe have seen in long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives rosary as gift from her globetrotting mother as it turns out the rosary belonged recentlydeceased brazilian priest the priests church had been under investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who has made career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in person is inflicted wounds like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie story considering she is an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself finding out what is going on he eventually begins suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video mean stigmata is the sort of that starts off ok and only gets worse indeed it would have been good if it were music video because it is only interesting for about five minutes am not sure what wainwright is trying prove his endless parade of slowmotion doubleexposure and extreme closeups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in and yes he has been school his camera trickery is interesting for little while but eventually it becomes headacheinducing what this needed is second audio track be played over the dialogue such as it is wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what can do am an excellent director maybe then he would explain why he decided start half of his scenes slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery did not see it just when you thought it was safe get involved in the story here comes doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery would not bother me if stigmata had story or characters that were remotely engaging though wainwrights vanity certainly does not help he does seem have been given nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that assume we are supposed identify and sympathize but we are not given any back story on her character or any reason like her the extent of her character development seems be that she is hardworking hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she is kind of cute so let us start the bleeding the fact that she is clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer does not help either according frankie page what is the first thing do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back go clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear be sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable even though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time hit on priest who wanders in her hair salon even more curiously he seems be interested in her advances father andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic as for pryce he may as well wear curled mustache and cackle will get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me am not revealing anything telling you pryce turns out be villain what is worse after being faced dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have contend story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible first of all the does not even bother explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely touching rosary how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually am not sure what frankie was posessed supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed the holy spirit but the later has her being posessed the dead priest and later some evil spirit think one is it the answer this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use this time furthermore the ending is ridiculously neat little wrapup and the filmmakers compound this problem ultimately turning the into diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you will find that it is not being suppressed the church as the seems claim but that it is readily available at your local library there is nothing the catholics need worry about though stigmatas religion is so offbase that it cannot be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone allout and equipped them sharkskin suits and tommy guns would have been far more interesting am not catholic in fact don care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this should not be considered realistic any means it is rare see that fails on as many levels as stigmata does it not thoughtprovoking though it would like be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends be am not sure why they tried pass this off as horror because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it is an attempt cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered blood is dulled the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us pick out the films many flaws am also still trying figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earthshattering when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school means that for all its flash the whole is really much ado about nothing the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it,0.0
john boormans zardoz is goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward wood jr has movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course woods career can be explained two things he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses explain zardoz or his followup the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you would not know it from this boorman does indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly overconceived arthurian epic excalibur and the fatherson jungle adventure the emerald forest his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he is ambitious and when he succeeds it is in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boormans his screenplay tries elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz book figures into the movies plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the events take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness be found in fact things seems have moved backwards people riding horses shooting oldstyle guns and living in large victorian mansions it is more middle ages than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally the society however if one breaks the rules that person is punished being aged so many years if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged the point of senility and imprisoned an eternal existence in geriatric home others aged criminals one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents farm so the immortals can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts godlike status among the people flying in their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movies opening images and it is dead giveaway of the lunacy come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch of outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose is kill most of the other outlanders so they cannot procreate and take up more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movies cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardozs flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back the vortex once there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality is mystery them they seem especially interested in his ability gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt determine what gets him worked up say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it be so he made this the straightest of faces although have hard time believing that as production moved forward he did not get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming just looking at connery is enough give one the giggles he spends most of the running around in red loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache and pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on cheap hooker boorman made the right after the critical and financial success of deliverance is the only reason can imagine studio would greenlight this effort he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond in and perhaps he was looking for change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it is wonder it did not end his career am sure boorman intended for this movie make some grand statements is it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it condemnation of those who consider growing old be bad thing or is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substances are the only ones can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than completely unintentional comedy,0.0
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least season of watching their show on hbo before became believer maybe after watching half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are big fan of the kids skip the as it is their firstand most likely onlyattempt at full length lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this makes it more difficult for the audience enjoy their antics brain candy is bunch of skits tied together the story of pharmaceutical company that develops new drug cure depression in typical sketchcomedy tradition each actor plays several roles doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the at about minutes brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability quickly deliver the laughs then go on another quick skit but the additional setup necessary in telling longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced as if they have live up pg rating one of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battlegoing have sex some guys taking shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kids unfortunately are not up the task there are some amusing moments be sure but not enough make the experience an enjoyable one,0.0
there was time when john carpenter was great horror director of course his best was masterpiece halloween but he also made the fog and underrated prince of darkness heck he even made good in in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened him in the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man somehow carpenter has lost his touch junk like his failed remake of village of the damned his uninspired sequel escape from a those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared his latest john carpenters vampires if was him definately would not want put my own name in the title it is sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires the story is simple jack crow james woods is vampire hunter who along one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina was previously bitten him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten valek becomes telepathically linked him until they themselves turn into vampires couple days later and crow is hoping find him the help of her it seems valeks mission is steal black wooden cross from roman catholic church that will enable him become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about as many times as better version of the story has been made john carpenters vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films have ever seen in fact there is not even one suspenseful moment in the whole minute running time the nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work is usually trademark of carpenters and then we come the screenplay as far as can tell is nearly nonexistent there is no story development and there is not even an attempt flesh out the characters james woods can be good actor but he has nothing do here but say couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenters vamires is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters he has said that he turned down directing halloween because he could not work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about vampires sequel he said he would be happy do it think that is definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not mention significant number of iq points,0.0

in ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america this ship was built be the largest ship in the world and she was she was also build be one of the most luxurious and that she was finally she was built be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not get ticket for this voyage you either spent lifes savings get america start life anew were part of the upper class and had the money spare or finally were lucky enough have full house in poker match the docks like jack dawson jack dawson makes the trip and happens be at the right place at the right time rose dewitt bukater first class passenger climbs the railings at the aft of the ship thoughts of jumping thus is started tale of romance and intrigue and tale of death and tragedy this movie is about tragic event that took place great many years ago an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia the movie titanic shows what happened maybe not degree of accuracy but it still shows it very realisticaly now the titanic is both story on its own and backdrop for story it serves as both admirably brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is but that alone is not enough the story is brought out certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced any great frequency the attention detail that was paid is remarkable the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor an already good movie part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast the performances put in the main stars is something be admired the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they are not acting but are actually the characters in the movie the casting for the movie could really have been better in my humble opinion that is one character that will most likely not be mentioned any other review or commentary about this is that of the ship itself yes you read correctly the ship is character how is the titanic character you ask well simple ship had certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you this character is everything about the ship from its specifications its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger this mr cameron brings the ship life in an almost literal sense all this adds the movie in certain way that most productions cant seem grasp now produce the effect that mentioned above and sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished special effects wizards the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening if your imagination is good the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique the movie will leave you amazed at the effects and that is feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie just humans and an oversized ship the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions the theater that went had few people leaving tears in their eyes now that is not feat accomplished most movies now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home something of punch wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning the very end the historical value of this movie is quite high and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy for it is extremely well done the method of telling the story is also good maybe not totally unique but effective none the less regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something be marveled at the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims achieve is just astonishing if you get the chance see this movie go it might not be the best movie in the world but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it during none of the hours and minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie,1.0
the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going destroy earth in the future after sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves leaps and bounds the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in while make that every years or so an evil force comes destroy earth the things needed defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element the plot in this movie really is not that important the thing though this movie has very good special effects for the most part the technoish music in the background fits the mood very well bruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in futuristic new york city one day lady draped few bandages drops down into his trunk this movie is about what happens the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails present the viewer variety of different locations also there is fair bit of action in the particularly towards the end some characters are just plain strange including highlyenergetic deejay in drag bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down it is one of those scifi films where you will be saying cool followed what the hell give the fifth element,1.0
note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned james tobacks return directing after eightyear layoff two girls and guy is is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and great deal of dialogue embracing near realtime approach this is highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written mr toback for his bantering characters fortunately the films cast is up the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the films setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly we meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside soho loft as they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they are both waiting for their respective boyfriends return from the airport and it does not take long for them come the realisation that they are being twotimed the same guy more indignant him than catty each other the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for confrontation it is when blake returns his abode where the hits its stride played magnificent bombast mr downey jr blake is cad all right but captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes new heights it is fascinating watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the films best choice was have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us size up blake not his interactions others but his own innate behaviour whether he is flamboyantly behind his piano in rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it is never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point almost hoped the would transform into oneman show typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin fly one of the great touches in the is how blake when startled carlas unannounced appearance begins both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag doubleteamed the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared its trio of characters two girls and guy concludes its first sequence an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this however it would be unfeasible attempt string along carla and lous outrage full featurelength and it is as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the films tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat subtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed barrel the toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girls and guy was embroiled in bitter longrunning dispute the mpaa regards this scene contractuallyobligated deliver an rrated mr toback was forced resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girls and guy serves as showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put the test in this he plays the gamut from indignant humbled from selfassured disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as not be registered it is wonderful performance in role customtailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and it is hard not see echoes of reality seeping into his character in monologue his mirrored reflection blakes selfchiding get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance while mr downey jr showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles ms graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has screenplay penned akiva goldsman she is quite appealing here playing character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely find it either annoying or like me endearing she tones it down substantially as the progresses but found her more fun watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox the was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girls and guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged good deal of improvisation from his three actors while the could be transposed directly the stage more or less intact it does not feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is wellused vary the background and mr toback allows his camera wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner two girls and guy falls short of its potential but thanks some stellar work mr downey jr it is still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends am an actor he tells them at one point using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense actors lie but not they all seem agree denzel washington,1.0
robert altmans cookies fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality be uplifting and make its viewers feel good it is sunny delightful dreamy comedy filled lovely performances skillful direction and topped off an understated clever extraordinary script as this is an ensemble piece it is forced start of slowly as it introduces us its characters all of them residing in southern town called holly springs first we meet willie charles dutton an honest man slight drinking habit we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled loneliness despair and want of her dead husband we cut camille glenn close who is obsessively directing play her sister cora julianne moore then we briefly get acquainted emma liv tyler an apparent relative of cookie who is downbutnotout teen outcast still full of love and hope even though she has no real place live we also fleetingly see emmas lover jason chris odonnell an ambitious but far too excitable young cop we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture and robert altman decides that it is time set the plot in motion we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at picture of her husband she exclaims here come and then puts pillow her face and shoots herself soon after her niece camille stops get fruit salad bowl comes upstairs finds cookie dead and flips out convinced that suicide is disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow yet sweet sister that it was murder she makes sure that she stages it like murder as well scattering jewelry all over the floor breaking few cabinets windows and doors and then throwing the gun out in the back yard the only reasonable suspect is willie who immediately gets taken into custody and put in jail cell they all know he did not do it so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble the sheriff and the faithful emma meanwhile the unperturbed camille continues her nonetoosubtle manipulations trying further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play success so begins cookies fortune aptly described critic scott renshaw as southern spin on fargo except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers darker somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade robert altmans slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well in that both films focus on and off on the eccentricities of the residents in southern us town indeed most of the characters in cookies fortune are loads of fun observe and portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi dimensional glenn close turns in an insubstantial in terms of her career but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie and she is perfectly cast as the prolific aunt alexandria character endlessly obsessed family dignity the equally essential role of willie is handled an intangible grace veteran thespian charles dutton mimic time kill there is nothing like movie leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours even days after the ends cookies fortune is such movie loved the light kindhearted approach altman whose last project was the dark intense drama the gingerbread man took towards the tricky subject matter enjoyed the talented ensemble cast even liked the trite in the south everybody is related everybody cliche that is inevitably employed the time this movie draws close am not sure why cookies fortune had such an allaround pleasing effect on me perhaps it is that good ol southern charm,1.0

i actually am fan of the original or so liveactiondisney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as pair of twins separated at birth divorcing parents never come in contact the other so the parents never have meet again and everyone should know how feel about remakes especially of films happen enjoy my fallacy unless you are going either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up gasp new idea this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary liveactiondisney films are not one of my favorties anyway they are usually unfunny alienating and big fat bore at least anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it is actually good not the original good but what is great about it is that it does not necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because it is cute and innocent fun because it has pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun follow along because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and am repeating myself because it is cute and innocent fun there is nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it is aimed directly at either kids adults who want remember the original or young adults who want remember what it was like be kid personally am somewhere between the second and third can vividly remember when my taste in movies was not so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick were not even glimmer in my right eye back then when would tune in every sunday night for couple years see abcs wonderful world of disney where they would show you liveaction andor madefortv disney flick an hour per week can remember my mom taking my sister and along all my friends and their mothers see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly remember every single christmas without fail there were barage of childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that would not dare missing can even remember seeing the madefortv parent trap ii on tv one night and after had seen that one over and over and over again saw the original parent trap it is more of late childhood movie because it deals the issue of divorce but it deals it in disneyized version it is playful and witty and charming and if saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood would probably dismiss it would probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if had not seen the original at such perfect age watching it could remember what fun it was watch disney and how divorce for me started get me thinking about the possibilities of my seeminglyperfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fuckedup of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it is also charming in its own way it has new cast contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for liveactiondisney flick tone that is not corny or condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in safe kind of way and for the first time since the original the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story is basically classic now repeated almost as many times as kurosawas the seven samurai pair of twins played here lindsay lohan just like they were played hayley mills in the original are separated at birth their divorcing parents one annie is sent live the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than had ever noticed in london where she lives her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also keen knowledge in sports and pokerplaying the other hallie is sent northern california her father dennis quaid live on vineyard their pseudomaid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants go become more rugged they feud because they look alltoo similar and are thus in tight competition results in some nasty pranks winds them in seclusion together in private outoftheway cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct scheme switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom they have only heard of they learn about eachothers lives in detail they make sure they look alike requires hair cutting and notoriously earpiercing scene is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan does not necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original but she comes off just as appealing as she did once she does though add couple new things she makes the california twin little more appealing and the london twin bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds on an american and british accent each one one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents are not exactly perfect she is also incredibly appealing not merely cute is especially notable since this is her first feature and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films she makes great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact has not been this likable in about decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him notable actor in the past not just that he is mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just has not ever been this likable period the two make winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen ohara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the adds another dimension and another angle their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love eachother and when back together again the films more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraineinducing way as in many such films this all brings this new parent trap level of entertainment that has not really existed since well the original years ago still my money the best liveactiondisney flick of all time this is because it has form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot golddigging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix who is deliciously tormented the twins later on in the treat instead of bore like the original this transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything it knows exactly how be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison the original it could be bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than liked watching two old flames getting back together over bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing lesson extracted from the howard hawkscary grant films of yesteryear and as much as this transcends mere cutedom compared the original this almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just

gere willis poitier chase each other around the world the jackal review michael redman copyright michael redman when the soviet union imploded the western countries lost their shadow the united states friendly the russians we no longer had an entity blame for the worlds problems this showed up in films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy it is time rejoice because we have found our new villain now it is no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands it is the russian _mafia_ perfect solution it combines the dread of organized crime and the stillpresent uneasiness the former eastern block countries best of all the villains are still foreigners fear of the other always plays best so it is crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal bruce willis assassinate highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during nightclub raid the fbi is at loss as how protect the target from someone they are not sure even exists coming their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen richard gere who is temporarily released from prison assist fbi agent carter preston sidney poitier and russian major valentina koslova diane venora mulqueens exgirlfriend basque terrorist isabella mathilda may is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met the follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his million hit and mulqueen attempts locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman does not slip away crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his minivan the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers being very loosely based on the same book the thriller the day of the jackal comparison between the two films is inevitable there is no doubt that the original is the better movie playing the story for suspense rather than the current actionadventure as mystery the jackal has enough holes in it ruin the tale but if you can accept it for what it is there is entertainment be had holes let us see pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers pick it up for year veteran that can command the big bucks the jackal is an incredibly poor shot the final scene between gere and willis occurs in location that should be mobbed police but it is just the two of them willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmers in the saint and lest you misunderstand that is not compliment but the three stars are fun watch it is good see gere in something other than business suit willis has mixed history in picking projects but his characters are always watchable poitier is far the superior actor but has limited screen time the problems in logic are flaws but do not ruin the experience occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes this is one of them the appeared in the bloomington voice bloomington indiana,1.0
it is terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed david koepp who made one of unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than month after the sixth sense is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of straightforward psychological horror while the sixth sense is closer psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary have feeling most viewers are going come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget judge this on its own respectable merits adapted from novel richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens cute sixyearold boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child is not the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hardworking wife one night while at party their closest friends tom convinces maggies newage sister lisa illena douglas try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he would not normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she did not expect it work but it did and the only way stop it is for tom somehow find way help this girl he sees stir of echoes is not perfect any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama and is not only effective on technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of struggling workingclass family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe dream the fishes are topnotch and exceedingly believable as loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over his desire solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being little worried what he is going through does not try stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier relate and always plausible as struggling couple who have work overtime at their jobs just make ends meet in masterfullydone entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching movie screen from inside theater is also showing movie screen in theater telling him move closer and closer the screen as fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin float closer and closer the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have seen hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one truthfully this setpiece and another in tom wakes up from nightmarish dream only quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just see them on the big screen having loads of fun her small role as maggies sister lisa illeana douglas die for her last great character is delight but rarely used her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets utter the best line in the while talking maggie about toms visions of the girl she remarks would not be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she is dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the when we flash back see what really happened her missing character and liza weil remarkable in whatever as morrisons grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up its obviously frightful full potential and it does not what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is director knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters stir of echoes is not as good as the sixth sense but why should it need be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is spinetinglingly good horror,1.0
usually when blockbuster comes out it is loaded effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action mystery men may contain an allstar cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works is rare see this year the is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot bob burden in wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only be out done the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear things go little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans wreak havoc upon champion city well the trio decide take matters in their own hands saving the city but first they need some assitance this is where the takes turn for the better in the beggining there were only wanna be heroes blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william macy sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens of rescue the from becoming disastorous mess thankfully the original heroes become amusing some support of reuben and garfalo on screen the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs few punches keep interest for one the is considerably clever it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in humorous and superior way part of the cleverness comes from the cast sometimes such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here while azaria and macy were enteratining characters really stood out one was paul reuben no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still cannot help but laugh it so incredibly moronic it is just riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions janeane garafalo also was an interesting character she seemed be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due her enthusiasm that kept the flowing men is worth seeing alone for those troubled heroes on the downside few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless their parts were so limited they would be lucky at all be on screen for more than minutes ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue none of these characters get rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects while the set designs and action all look nice am glad there was seperate aspect that the focused on and for that applaud slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers it forgets about money making because it is not likely make bundle like it is proceeders and that is what works stupid maybe but for once am not disappointed no one expected an intelligent but you get thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year,1.0
review peter jacksons the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in movie and still coming in at the extremely cheap million price tag but for those who were dismayed this years blockbusters like twister and independence day the frighteners has much more offer than special effects and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise you can rest easily the frighteners is as far removed from as highprofile movie can get michael fox stars as frank bannister con artist who can speak ghosts he uses this ability set up scam in small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people then he comes and pretends get rid of them this is how he has made living ever since his wife died in car crash years ago franks latest customers are young couple played trini alvarado and peter dobson when dobson ends up dead alvarado starts take an interest in fox but dobsons spirit is still around as he refuses beleive he is dead this leads very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado dobson tagging along as ghost things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for series of murders taking place in the town fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims but noone else can see that so when fox shows up try and save each victim naturally people suspect he is the killer fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collectors hit list and the last half hour of the movie deals foxs attempts save her from this evil spirit there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written peter jackson and frances walsh the movie starts off as black comedy and ends up horroraction the mix between these genres are perfect no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror and vice versa one point of contention might be lackluster score danny elfman but that hardly seems like flaw when you have such diverse cast all in top form michael fox delivers one of his best performances date as man who hides the sorrow of his wifes death and then is forced confront this later on alvarado looking like andie macdowell makes great frightened tough and smart heroine and jeffery combs as paranoid fbi agent is brilliantly bizaare the frighteners never once feels like it is running long the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters this movie is probably what casper would have looked like if david lynch directed it it is easily the best of the year so far,1.0
before you read my review you gotta know that love woody allen this is very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone know folks who believe him be complete genius while others see him as dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again love most of his films but will admit having been quite disappointed his recent crop during the in fact why he felt the need make movies in those years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films you will hear what am saying the only two films of his that really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just reenergize or something but it does not appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is and woody allen is topnotch insurance investigator his methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date new employee hunt has just been hired streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under hypnotic trance magician and unbeknownst them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique wonderful recreation of the style movies the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers catchy jazz score moving things along noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore and fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the actually starts off pretty slowly the first hour tossing only few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so kept hoping that the would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it was not not long before was fully engaged the characters entertained the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage the films of old parody and actual reinvention note therons entire female persona that is drenched in noir very cool of course films like this little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue and once again allen does great job in playing his character who for once is not his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in he is hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this was helen hunt an actress who was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway she is really great in this as the headstrong woman looking new era of equality amongst men and does not miss beat of allens fastpaced dialogue did not care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left room but overall she was really good and especially liked the way that her sweaters clung her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but digress so let us recap great looking picture nice jazzy score some funny oneliners especially in the second half decent plotline although you should not expect real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around cannot say that this is even remotely close any of allens best work but certainly believe it be step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through it is probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but would still recommend this anyone looking for cute oldschool kind of vibe chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and satisfying conclusion little known facts about this and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally you have got mail,1.0

martin scorseses triumphant adaptation of edith whartons the age of innocence is stunning for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets life it seems like an odd choice for scorsese do period piece in the early but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is wonder and testament the greatness of scorsese as filmmaker this is gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorseses finest newland archer daylewis is prestigious lawyer who is engaged may welland ryder somewhat empty and shallow new yorker who belongs prestigious family and is quite beautiful the marriage is one will unite two very prestigious families in society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others on the day that archer is announce his engagement may countess ellen olenska pfeiffer cousin of may walks into archers life archer is immediately captivated and finds himself in love ellen archer is also bound the limits of new york society is an intrusive as any other in the world archer finds himself having secret love affair in his mind countess olenska attempting keep her in his mind while trying not lose his social status the films subject matter may seem alien scorsese but the theme is definitely not it is theme of forbidden romance guilty pleasures and the consequences causes because of those actions there is painstakingly flawed hero and his choice between the life he wants and the life he is destined for in truth it is about society the audience does not know about but wants find out more much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun the performances are absolutely breathtaking daylewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced take pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well ryder is probably the gem of the group for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot and slowly pushes daylewis closer and closer his eventual ending the supporting cast is also wonderful several characters so singular that they are indelible in ones memory scorsese definitely has passion for filmmaking his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is wondrous sight he literally transports the viewer another world incredible imagery his script is also excellent slow in buildup rapid conclusion and fantastic ending that has be seen be believed it is difficult make period piece gripping scorsese however does it beautifully the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere he is patient but he films everything and anything remotely important the cameras sweep pan track and do more than they have ever done but they are so subtle one does not realize he is watching all the scorsese hallmarks until nd viewing the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot but the viewer does not notice it because we want see more of this gorgeous world there are few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding and joanne woodward narration is exquisite not fast like goodfellas this shares more in common kundun than anything else and like kundun this is slowstarting that truly shines when given the chance fully breathe and bloom in the end beautiful director continuing challenge himself year after year,1.0

friends fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevins real father is it all just big nightmare or is john milton really satan playing tricks kevins life the devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted surprise everyone giving us something we do not expect is this surprise conclusion supposed make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devils advocate messes up completely and ironically felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than would have if it had ended ten minutes early went into the devils advocate expecting shocking horror and that is exactly what got was settled in be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what got but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did mention that did not like the ending the producers of this take you on thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you films like seen and the usual suspects can survive this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going end in an unpredictable way the devils advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing recommend watching the and then reading that again as for the overall enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot increase the tension build from the character study the runs like wellbuilt clock slowly building until finally exploding highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for nice resolution does not occur it was at this point that felt cheated taking us on terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced witness conclusion makes most of the seem like game do not want spoil the ending so all can say is go see the and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned its rating for reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this really is not subtle about anything showing us everything it actually surprises me that this did not receive an nc rating as it is quite harsh however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those do not condone sex and nudity in films but if its there might as well enjoy it the biggest merit of this is also the most interesting watch the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed the extremely effective charlize theron mary anns problems are incredibly intense and found myself wanting witness her decline this may sound uncaring but wanted watch because felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into world where she is not wanted something the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for of this nature the story actually has something say about humanity in one of the last scenes john milton explains kevin lomax the game god plays his children he is satan of course he comments that it is human nature lust and loathe in vanity then god sets up rules contradict human nature this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton says is so true about our society that found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but am sure they came straight from the novel it was based on when has something say about our society it deserves be watched the cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we do not expect heather matarazzo makes brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does great job probably the big surprise of this is keanu reeves he has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself this performance have never seen him more believable date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off also gives good performance as eddie barzoon judith ivey manages credible performance as the mother who holds secret kevins past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times one familiar face twist was coach star craig nelson who gives very good performance the devils advocate is rated for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minutes this moves along fairly quickly for the first two hours sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters the technical quality is also remarkable great special effects and good musical score director taylor hackford has managed create very disturbing motion picture only ruin good chunk of tension the final fifteen minutes guess my biggest problem the ending is the fact that went into the theater expecting disturbing and hackford gave me just that for long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the safety net in order make his more mainstream personally would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early,1.0

the most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike movie it is mean that as the highest compliment if most studios were profile an elderly couple who rekindle yearold romance would want run and hide the sex scenes would be handled as farce producers would shed years off the characters ages so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence along charming romantic story the australianbelgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable the romance gets started when former musician andreas charles bud tingwell learns that his true love claire julia blake lives nearby they decide catch up on old times but soon find themselves in reinvigorating affair complicating matters is andreas frail health and claires longtime husband terry norris who cannot understand why he is suddenly become obsolete in my mind the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire than the feelings of everyone involved john claires husband endlessly questions what he did wrong claire initially insists she is grownup but admittedly behaves like child prospect that thrills and disappoints her andreas an agnostic begins question his fate message cox delivers in memorable dream sequence cox litters the movie flashbacks including the repeated vision of roaring train it is reminder of andreas and claires past love as young lovers they met train but as it recurs we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed pall is cast on the whole affair master of the understated cox strings together series of memorable moments in andreas dream sequence amidst the roar of the train and conversations we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love we also get glimpses into john and claires relationship during silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward claire admits john about her indiscretion telling more than any monologue could all that is heard is the scraping of forks against plates the characters are unlike anything have seen they are people so many times movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky or they are reduced comedic buffoons ordinary people pile of emotions claire and andreas are not sure what the next step is they do want be happy consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they have known throughout their adult lives bravo cox who wrote the script for not making john monster so that claires affair is automatically justified norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult accept we feel for him he is decent man sure he may have become complacent but he never expected this especially now so much presented the audience it is only expected that the material gets little drawn out and repetitive it does however in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers cox displays skill and lan is not likely be surpassed anyone anytime soon,1.0

tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently the dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months kundun presence name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in the search for the th incarnation of the tibetan leader group of monks enters village and twoyearold child catches their attention the young boy proves himself identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine he and his family are then moved monastery in lhassa where he is be prepared take his position as the religious and political leader of the country he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results eventually he must make the painful choice flee neighboring india comparisons seven years in tibet are inevitable both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt kundun features only native actors and is more of an insiders story in some ways this makes this superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audiencepleaser the actors contribute the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like wax dummy and moves as if he were computergenerated character on an intellectual level it is interesting see how two different approaches handle the same facts some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life is not even mentioned here glossed over in seven years the problems the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about change things after the chinese attack the is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily the cinematography of roger deakins his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture luscious detail especially striking is an extreme moving close up of sand mandala grain grain the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating poetic meditation for the audience walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from transcendental experience martin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears something of thematic followup his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest yet oddly enough for director history of graphic violence presenting history filled atrocities the chinese most of these events take place offscreen his decision not overexplain rituals is commendable the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in trance state is much more effective as mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting talked tibetan met outside the theater who had just seen the and was walking back in see it again hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip india was struck what was missing in the movie as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is distance between the audience and the movie the is more concerned visuals and history and less so human beings the exception of few scenes involvement the characters is slight one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as mischievous boy who cannot resist being kid sometimes an encounter his older brother thubten norbu retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him persuade him accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there are not many of these even its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that fear most will miss many people who saw seven years in tibet will have been there done that attitude it is likely that the will miss widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping,1.0
i swear have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like the plot in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the but leave it screenwriter david mamet add humor and few surprises mess your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts add it his script action films are dime dozen in and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing would make them more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this genre is probably the least respected of them all the river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films have seen from the the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and half is riddled cliches and plot holes this is an example of the final act saving the instead of the other way around as in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become great action and use the term loosely the edge is pretty much survivalofthefittest but taking screams lead the edge makes fun of the genres cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought him for once we do not immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin photographer who is going take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board plane and head cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives gold watch from his wife and pocket knife from bob as action films go these items do have importance the rest of the story but quite bit more than we first expect soon however bob wants find native shoot pictures of because of his personality charles bob bobs assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off find him and as shown in the previews hit flock of birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot is about follow and therefore has create original ways approach the situations he succeeds often enough for us enjoy the take for instance the entire manhunting bear plot this has been done many times in films different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bobs uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems have seen these action films before my favorite line of the comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they did not do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot subplot develops late in the took me surprise and made me smile when realized that everything is not as it seems anymore have write cautiously as not reveal this surprise so instead will avoid it entirely the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able create lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility have always wondered why characters in films walk over log get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across guess getting chased bear makes your thought process turn off for while thankfully we already have begun care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting of the is highly above average for of this nature and borders on phenomenal anthony hopkins gives terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs alec baldwin gives one of his best performances have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be good or bad character and here he succeeds at both in way you can never quite guess if he is nice or vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able handle the doublenatured photographer elle macpherson gives good performance albeit slight she is not in the all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as model harold perrineau is good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and reveal nothing saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is little too disturbing even for me this is nice change from the mindless action most of us are used but too many cliches bog it down director tamahori has created very smooth and suspenseful action out of recycled parts david mamets script though has lot of humor keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending does not end the normal highstrung action sequence but small detail involving certain gift it is nice touch considering what we have had go through the bear and the way most people laughed when the faded black due large credit bart the bear way go bart,1.0
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made seen is just few steps away from brilliance however those few steps away are only few steps from level of evil and depravity that few people want discuss the received mixed reviews upon release but there is an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue this that many critics perhaps did not notice at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems be criticizing but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable this piece of work is intensity it is uncomfortable watch yet compelling want not look yet cannot turn away the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted visionary director david fincher he has experience in tantalizing his audience information and visions but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien seen is even more ominous because the threat is real it is human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic that is if human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credits have ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset knowledgeable veteran who is ready give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt costars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new this unnamed city and full of fury catch the bad guys these two fine actors give the its human qualities along the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife however none of them stands out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset has only week or that is seven days left on the force train his young protege the title of the picture also refers the deadly sins as chronicled john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found it is the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but will not give that away as said this has great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer sets out make statement the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it the two partners stumble over the corpse of grotesquely obese man they learn that he was murderedforced eat himself death the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough stay him all the way if they did not it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see lot of blood but it is not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in pulp fiction seen is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is postdeath still if you tend get queasy do not eat food during this kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that he is the messenger who will right the wrongs his teachings like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself spacey does not appear until the final minutes and also does not receive billing in the opening credits however it is his appearance that turns this upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination great villain manages make you either root for him or feel compelled listen his ramblings regardless of whether you agree him or not this character is so well written that it is hard disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered everyone no serial killer has ever been so creative seen is blatantly unsubtle its messages about the horrors of the world and it is often little too depressing what it lacks in those areas it makes up for believable dialogue topnotch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters the technical aspects of the are unobtrusive fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the fortunately we do not find out what happens mills and somerset after the closing credits are run backwards up the screen it is better imagine what paths they will follow this is not the kind of you turn away from and quickly forget it is got sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world are not going cure themselves seen raises some tough questions and it is intelligent enough allow its audience answer many of those questions for themselves useless triviacostars in seen brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best supporting actor oscarpitt in monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for he won,1.0
there are some works of art that are almost impossible review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status prevents the reviewer say anything original one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one its popularity can be measured not in multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works this day casablanca is also movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised the critics and loved general audience one of the things that makes this even more unique was the fact that it was doomed fail at least judging conventional moviemaking wisdom of its time it was based on broadway play so mediocre that it had not been produced on stage screenplay three writers julius epstein philip epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered be capable but not great director however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best until this very day it is considered be the best example of making in its own golden age the plot of the movie was heavily influenced the needs of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order make intriguing story in december casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled officially neutral yet nazicollaborating french vichy government thousands of refugees from wartorn europe are stuck there on the way lisbon and safety of america and ready pay any price for precious exit visas many shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used be idealistic antifascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas this event coincides the arrival of two new refugees casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman whom rick had stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced choose between love wounded pride selfpreserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona the star status bogarts portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen did not look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic ever made but the reason for that is not the romance itself it is the realistic story of people forced make tough and often wrong choices in their life the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in case of main leads the supporting actors also did marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly give mystic flavour spotted in previous bogart classic john hustons maltese falcon yet both of them managed portray colourful and original characters another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like somebody who could inspire millions of people rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed rickilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed claude rains in role of lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rains also gave another dimension the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like analyse movies death discovered signs of homosexuality in renaults relationship towards rick and ricks final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations together welldrawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpickers would probably have field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still shining example of ww movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we do not see it as historical document casablanca is movie that can

like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is true work of art it is one of those few movies of the that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence why is this such good there are almost too many reasons explain the story court composer salieri murray abraham feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart tom hulce comes into his life as the young genius composer salieri feels envy and jealousy but at the same time is fascinated mozarts brilliance and ingenious we travel through mozarts life as composer through his struggles his triumphs and ultimately his demise the acting abraham is magnificient as salieri his acting range enables him focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language this performance earned him well deserved oscar tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart quirky annoying bratty kid an annoying laugh he is strong but weak at the same time and must be aided his wife elizabeth berridge who is good in her role but lacks dramatic depth jeffrey jones in smaller more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world is cast perfectly because of his noble charm the movie every element of this movie works the costumes and makeup are very memorable as well as its stunning art direction and unforgettable scores adapted from mozarts original music while wolfgang amadeus mozart was genius at music milos forman proves his that he is genius of filmmaking this movie is classic that will be remembered for years come adam almost lost my nose and like it like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown,1.0
armageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking stories have been replaced special effects character development gets overshadowed bad dialogue plotting consists of bunch of shit getting blown up armageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie you will see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer but loved every freaking minute of it believe me am just as shocked as you are hell do not even know why went see it in the first place the previews were so annoying that predicted this was going be the worst of the year or at least in the running am sorry but somebody dial is not quite the tagging that is going sell movie it is not too wise either market the using the movies stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing mean let us face it armageddons previews rival the truman show is as being some of the worst of the year neither of them even come close doing their respective films justice of course you all know the story when the earth is threatened total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the uss top oil drillers go into space and implant nuclear device eighthundred and someodd feet into the asteroid in the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced some interesting and not so interesting characters belonging the former group is rockhound steve buscemi horny little womanizing genius who is always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at huge amount of gs also there is the always coolashell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo only without the intensity and great lines deliver then on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing annoying accent cannot quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie basically that is about it as said this is hardly about plot it is another summer blockbuster plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden case in point nasa does not know that there is even an asteroid on it is way until eighteen days before impact huh another example at one point in the movie two children are playing toy space shuttles in front of poster of kennedy how pretentious is that want another one okay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on jet plane and soon all the rest join in did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture but naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate one bitchin time at the movies and do not get me wrong despite all of the things found wrong armageddon still very much enjoyed it so even if you do not win one of mcdonalds free tickets it is still definitely worth checking out,1.0
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens be animated there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywoods most famous celebrities some fabulous animation and compelling story this is the best we have seen from disney since beauty and the beast this begins an unspecified time following the happilyeverafter conclusion toy story in the aftermath of their earlier adventures buzz voice of tim allen and woody voice of tom hanks are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony content their lives one day andy broke woodys arm off while playing him woody is now officially discarged and worthless left his nightmares where he lies in trash can the other discards later andys mother decides have yard sale and she collects few old toys from her sons room since one of these discards is member of the moving toy gang woody goes the rescue leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order bring the toy back although his mission is successful he is placed in serious predicament when toy collector named al voice of wayne knight spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series woodys roundup if he can acquire woody al can ship everything toy museum in japan for huge profit so after andys mother refuses sell the wooden cowboy al steals him and it is up the other toys led buzz go into the city save their friend and so buzz rex voice of wallace shawn hamm voice of john ratzenberger mr potatohead voice of don rickles and slinky voice of jim varney go out on dangerous journey rescue their friend they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys there are car chases gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis who the way resembles darth vader meanwhile woody learns that he was once tv celebrity and has family cowgirl named jessie voice of joan cusack horse named bullseye and father figure called the prospector voice of kelsey grammar they offer him another life as celebrity toy in museum in japan he is now forced choose between being loved intensively andy for little while before he grows up and be forgotten or be admired children for generations the problem is if woody escapes from als clutches and returns home they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage real effort is made in the technical department the animation is rich and colorful lots of wonderful details the cinematography is also extremely improved since toy story there are lot of complicated swings turns and closeups that really make an impression lighting and filters are used create mood as in surprisingly emotional moment jessies remembrance of her days when she was beloved toy the contains lot of inside jokes such as the one about videogames and entertaining parodies on jurassic park and star wars the ends the failed takes the kind of scenes that we are used see after comedy shows on tv these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the but what in the end makes toy story memorable experience is not the jokes its multiple parodies or marvelous animation it is its heart and emotions the story about the meaning of friendship love and even life itself it is not difficult predict that toy story would be huge economical success but its artistic achievement was unexpected unexpected because the first was not much more than demonstration of special effects but mostly it was unexpected because disney has not produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed companies such as dreamworks and warner brs but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that years this is big stepaway from the ancient laws of disneyanimation off course this is not antz it is not as intelligent this is not landmark and no masterpiece but promise that you will find it as funny and enjoyable as have whether this is the best animated of the year dare not say my choice would probably be the iron giant but along side american pie this is the comedy of the year almost lost my hopes for disney but toy story proves that disney has not lost their ability entertain,1.0
not too many people know who james whale is but it is safe bet that good chunk of them have seen his movies if we are believe the semi biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it be that way this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in movie gods and monsters has no interest in being biopic of whales life because it tracks only the final few days of his life and it is probably better movie for it it is focus is on whales ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser it begins whale fairly talented artist aside from being director asking boone sit for him pose for portrait at first boone does not realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated the old man when he does discover whales sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing sit for the guy but he comes back only storm out again disgusted whales locker room talk boone returns yet another time after whale promises tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and finds their platonic relationship be strengthening meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as result of his stroke not long ago his ailment leads desperation and depression build the point where he is forced ask boone for an incredulously big favor what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan frasers bravura performance up until seeing this intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency ruin the movies he is in blast from the past for example was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself be here this is impressive because his characters dialogue is minimal mckellan doing most of the talking that requires fraser act through body language difficult skill master but something he proves capable of doing well this is not ignore mckellans oscar nominated turn he earned that nomination his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like philistine would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the horror genre and he thought be the equivalent of battlefield he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going receptions fellow movie people in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memories of and war blending together form living nightmare eugene novikov,1.0
when initially set out review this my tag line was going be you too can believe whales can fly then it was going be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then it was going be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally just gave up trying come up tag line and decided say there is lot of flying going on in this as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was bring it out every year some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell the wayside for while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part of this might have something do the cold reception the got when it was first released in grossing somewhere close in its original month of release subsequent rereleases of the have elevated the popularity of the the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up present the animated in fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented is set beethovens fifth symphony it is hard describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems be going great for these little things until the ground erupts swarms of evil black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns the butterfly things though this segment is not very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin overtake the skies the next segment is set ottorino respighis the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape whale calf gets into scuffle some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in giant iceberg he smashes into while trying avoid the birds attack he is finally saved another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries find way out its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set george gershwins rhapsody in blue this segment is designed as tribute acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york there is construction worker who dreams of being jazz drummer an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having job young girl that dreams of spending time her parents instead of being hustled off schoolmarm and nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife will not go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set dmitri shostakovichs piano concerto no and is an animated version of hans christian andersens the steadfast tin soldier one legged toy tin soldier falls in love windup clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he cannot see her other leg extended out behind her much the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester the jester knocks the soldier out of window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only be swallowed fish that has been captured and sold the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told in the framework of seven minute short some children may find the jester be little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set camille saintsaens the carnival of the animals this segment features flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos yoyo while they are trying perform choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and throwback the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment be repeated from the original fantasia and it is the one that people remember most the sorcerers apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment was not made be presented on large format considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard make out due the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image be shown accurately but no one seems notice for some strange reason an anomaly common many plus screen theaters segment seven is set sir edward elgars pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment feature stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one did not make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings whole new meaning the clich saving the best for last set igor stravinskys the firebird an elk awakens forest sprite that proceeds change the wintery landscape into beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about large mountain housing strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due the enlargement of the the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martins clip is pretty funny be sure stay through the credits for little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee take on the four horsemen set wagners ride of the valkyries and strange segment prepared in the salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is perfect way spend the afternoon the is also decent family entertainment and contains little no objectionable material as mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you spend on this fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going be brought out in regular theaters must stress that the best way see this is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly g,1.0
it is tough really say something nice about type of person who is so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but god american history does it and for that commend it it not only takes balls but intelligence make human being out of neonazi skinhead kind of person who dedicates their lives hating anyone who is not what they are and this wisely and miracurously pulls it off the subject of this is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack he is the one who instigates them take firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks he is so utterly convincing as public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he is played edward norton so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he is almost as convincing and arresting public speaker as say malcom when we first see him he is clean shaven jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast devlish goatee and he is attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying handgun in his hand that never seems run out of bullets at least when he does not need them he so believes in his convictions that he is willing put his beliefs the test even if he knows it will mean stop in prison if only for couple years american history is about derek how he became neonazi skinhead how he rose power how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in fit of rage that was less do the stealing of his car and more do proving himself and how he tried save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stages as smart teenager vicious hate monger man having an epiphany and the man who tries correct what he is done before and in all of these we get portrait of man from all sides or at least that is the intention the films framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space is trying correct him when the opens danny has just written book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble sweeney causes him make him write paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he is cleanedup not as buff and has full head of hair he is just as intelligent but still very rough along the edges but he is wisened up he is no longer controlled his anger at blacks and jews and tries persuade danny who is becoming what derek was before give up his lifestyle but danny will not he goes large skinhead beer bash meets the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is as opposed neonazidom as he was for it couple of years ago the circles around this then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime as skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants do the same work and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on them the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he backs everything up political reasons justifying their rage at least them and frighteningly enough much of what he says sounds true american history is collection of really great scenes and moments rather than cohesive great that flows effortlessly from one moment the next in it there are some of the best scenes have seen all year one scene features dinner between dereks family and his mothers newest boyfriend played reserve eliott gould jewish liberal who quietly disagrees dereks rightist views launching the scene into fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience goulds reaction dereks final summation is unnerrving another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk build friendship and nice connection between derek and black coworker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail contains final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there is much more appreciate like the acting is uniformly good standouts coming from avery brooks beverly dangelo as the longsuffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off the best performance he is given in what seems like really long time norton walks off the though coming off such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation and maybe the best there is nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie spewing out lines such authority that he commands all attention from the audience coming off power similar that of young maron brando that he allows the little emotions seep through is amazing sadly enough this is not going be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes be it is too unambitious and even little contrived really take off as either powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movies tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinheads are reduced mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire eat more and even the dramatic arc is not as well travelled furlongs danny never seems really be learning lesson since the flashbacks refuse show his point of view and when he decides make change the end was inevitable it does not seem like it has actually arrived there even dereks descent into skinheaddom does not seem justified though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and do not ask me how know that is killed black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs as such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted have his name removed sorta american history is very good movie and was very moved it but it could be lot better and the problem seems be that the cut as it is is not up what he claims be his potential somewhere he claims there lies tony kaye cut and that was be the true cut until it was viewed norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit go alan smithee the resident name for any that is be disowned its director it was not allowed him under the grounds that once you disown you can not badmouth it but really that is the macguffin no one really wanted this good be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kayes right in that it is not up par even if he is not referring normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be do the right thing for the late yet it still gets its point across intelligently and backs it up its story its message that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it is not perfect at least when avery brooks turns norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he is done has made his life any better it realy hits nerve not only in derek but also in the audience,1.0

the idea at the center of the devils advocate is thus far one of the three or four best films of is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is trickster satan is humanist the last humanist he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity far my favorite sin al pacino plays this role relish and gets chew some delectable lines lemme givya piece inside wisdom on god have million names as john milton the devil the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case buisness man harkens mainly back terry gilliams the time bandits but the is something else something original part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles morality vanity death and child abuse but does not try become any profound study of power this is marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking it is also entertaining there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the minds eye the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coens fargo the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows its nice know that things like this are still being made,1.0

it is always refreshing see superstar actor who gets paid more than enough forget about working for living want take chance and play lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if was being paid million for one months work would probably be willing take risks as well but that is neither here nor there payback is based on novel richard stark apparently actually donald westlake author of the grifters itself fine crime was also filmed in the as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the opens gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back whom we do not know yet all we know is that gibson as porter is not happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man he is after is val gregg henry his sometime partner whom he stole briefcase full of cash from gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money pay off debt his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val gibson gives terrific performance in the sort of role he was born play that of slightly unhinged guy who does not mind beating up or shooting people get what he wants you probably would not see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat outofcharacter role such as porter jim carrey will not be doing anything like this in hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played villain was batman and robin we will not mention further and has stallone ever really played villain at all this is not say that porter is villain per se while he is not the sort of character you would not want get on the wrong side of he is nothing compared some of the ones we are forced watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just prove how mean they are porter is only trying get back what is notsorightfully his in way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller will not be remembered as being among gibsons most important work but is still one of the finer films he is done the only real problem it is that while everything seems work out in the end was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voiceover does not ring true even though it was used good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the embodies the just ends far too suddenly after huge buildup in the penultimate scenes fine even though it needs just little something more be the kind of that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for possible letdown of an ending,1.0

there is striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach watch the sun rise the camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black then the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up you see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel human touch it is an important scene for several reasons first of all it is one of many instances in the that make angels seem thoroughly plausible the presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on little interference there are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield or michael the angels here are stark and believable this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well they eternally walk the earth listening our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying heaven like human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially love story between seth and human beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan he first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting lead the soul of her dying patient heaven maggie is distraught doing everything in her power stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies angels have the limited power soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can his invisible touch but it is not enough he wants be her and share her pain not just stand back at distance he learns that the only way fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him fall and become human he learns this from another fallen angel played dennis franz y d blue in touching and humorous performance sitting at diner together franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is be human be able taste food feel another persons skin smell the air and most importantly have loving wife and children of course there is pain go along all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting wings of desire wenders was more like poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human and unlike most foreign films that are remade into fare it does not suffer extensive damage this may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted make city of angels its own movie inspired wings of desire but not an attempt copy it and yet city of angels is not typical movie it is beautifully filmed in lush colors cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world seale creates many striking visuals in addition the beach scene there is wonderful sequence in circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk while the travels along charted plot it takes time develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are both cage and ryan give soulful softspoken performances ryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies sadness that can only be alleviated heavenly touch cage projects all his desire and longing be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have what is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added new ending the screenplay is both unexpected and challenging it is not formulaic ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time it does not give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of romance instead it offers something much better something that speaks the depths of what it means be human and alive ____________________________________________ visit charlie do not surf an eclectic collection of reviews james kendrick http www bigfoot comjimkendrick email jimkendrickbigfoot com,1.0
star wars episode the phantom menace review matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star wars the original blockbuster and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or jedi is than budget deficit or serb so years after the release of the original and years since the third the return of the jedi how can any new star wars withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can new storyline and new cast of characters possibly compete the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the is neither flop nor disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is worthy sequel er prequel the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke the force in the original star wars is only young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor quigon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi settle trade dispute that has developed into blockade of the planet naboo shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of planetary invasion rushing protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced stop at tatooine repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her the galactic senate make an appeal for justice on tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts quigon senses the child is unusually strong the force and begins suspect that he may be the one prophesized bring balance the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being galactic savior the innocentlooking yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out lethal apprentice darth maul find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight save her planet they soon also have deal the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakins turn evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the films story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it is unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly lukes story the stories centering around his growth from farmboy rebel hero jedi knight but it is unclear whether this new is anakins story or obiwans if this trilogy is centered on anakin it is shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work some iffy dialogue lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room give her character much personality the biggest problem the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas does not do as good of job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obiwan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns lot about all four characters in the ways they react the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace flesh out the characters and their relationships each other individually they are interesting characters clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetianlooking planet of naboo watch spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in were changes that allowed him give the earlier movies the look and feel that just were not possible when the films were made more than ever in this new lucas universe is filled menagerie of creatures robots personalities and supporting cast of aliens who interact the main characters the best such character is watto greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has scratchy italian voice and short paunchy body oddly mismatched wings that flutter like hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computergenerated characters in the watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computergenerated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the jar jar binks more than minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream include fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the and becomes qui jons accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs comicrelief role in the lightening scenes his mishaps and inability stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts the characters throughout the as if he were really on the set the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar is not completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like cartoon blend into scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends roger rabbit like presence you accept that he is there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially found jar jar annoying but grew enjoy the humor he added the on my second viewing of the jar jar was lot of fun and did not mind him at all second reason this continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the is replete humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the films struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about ones destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas has not lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar oneman twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the films thrilling podrace sequence cameo appearance t in the the phantom menace is simply lot of fun lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning end there are lightsaber battles hairraising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars and the final showdown between obiwan quigon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace will not win any major oscars it probably will not beat titanics box office record and it is not even the best star wars would put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but it is an exciting and entertaining far better than your typical summer blockbuster the cannot live up it is hype no not even the original star wars could have done that but it is still worth seeing probably more than once,1.0

director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us slick and entertaining remake of the of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen nicolas cage plays memphis retired car thief who is pulled back in the business an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi memphis is ordered steal cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having elude the detectives hot on his trail and rival car thief who feels the job should have been given him and his gang memphis sets out put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits in that sequence we get rockin little tune from moby along some simple back story told only photographs and assorted objects filmmakers can sometimes make or break just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride and what follows does not disappoint cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way good or bad do not know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the along nicely of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the just provide eye candy she is definitely the hottest looking grease monkey have ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around lend the some class also am big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love see him get huge role someday none of these three performers are given much do unfortunately some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindos partner just wish some of the other characters could have been as important the only real gripe have about the though is its conclusion mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll there is no doubt in anyones mind that the cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew perfectly good opportunity add some suspense the picture using the rival car thief plot line as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the in tidy little package but if was making this would have had the rival gang trying get the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have improvise thereby adding some meat the plot the finale is essentially just big car chase and there just are not ways make car chases interesting anymore it is all been done the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene sure it is car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it it is very hard tell finally there is stunt during this scene that comes close challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh do not think so department despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment it is not thought provoking but it is shiny loud and fun just what summer flick should be pg,1.0
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so this is set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late searly inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched it and now george lucas brings it back for new audience enjoy much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now some fans are angry that he has dared meddle what they consider perfection while others are thrilled the idea of seeing yesterdays star wars updated todays special effects wizardry either way the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen where it rightfully deserves be seen can there be anyone in the world who does not know what star wars is about in way star wars is so much part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial try summarize it it is story about young mans coming of age fight for freedom against an oppressive empire tale of swashbuckling and derringdo the likes of have not been seen on the silver screen in decades strange new worlds strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn and the yearning within each of us realize our dreams and make difference in the world it is high adventure incredible special effects and well it is just an _experience_ something about this movie sparked the imagination of generation and it is about do so again this new release of star wars comes as no surprise many of the films devoted fans who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now interviews trailers leaks from within lucasfilm all of these have been collected collated and placed on webpages for people see pages such as http www islandnet comcoronafilmsdetailssw html or my personal favorite http leopard cs latrobe edu aukoukoula pictures of before and after have been placed side side even months before the movies were released fans were making comparisons in some cases the changes were nothing less than phenomenal and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater the digital matte effects that were little more than toy in forrest gump are put excellent use here unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied in the original for instance in my personal favorite example the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly flat stone edifice now has deep mosscovered carvings and etchings and mos eisley spaceport is now bustling booming city more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing all the starships and fighters are now computeranimated getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the was originally madeand they look _fantastic_ four and half minutes of new or missing footage have been added including scene jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in simply could not do it justice however much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the itself the negatives badly damaged the ravages of time were brightened and returned their original splendor the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed reworked sound effects effects maven ben burtt into glorious booming theatershaking fullthx dolby digital stereo and _that_ more than the added scenes or new special effects is where the real value of this new version lies it is really true what they say in the commercials star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen even letterboxing does not make up for the decrease in size and definition in regard the star wars special edition and the other two films of the trilogy have yet be released will make this final recommendation go and see it go and see it more than once it may be another twenty years before it comes back the big screen after it is gone this time take along the youngsters who have never had the bigscreen star wars experienceyou will enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time there is magic in this moviespecial edition or no there can be no denying that it is still star wars and still has the power thrill and enthrall children of all ages from four four hundred let us all return that time long ago and that galaxy far far away,1.0

cinematically speaking gordon parks original _shaft_ is not great bit slow at times and more than little rough around the edges as it builds its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidymans black private dick that is sex machine all the chicks the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly years after its original releaseand long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died that decadethe _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the films connection moviegoers far beyond the target africanamerican audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broadbased appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had problem that could simply kiss his ass this fact also explains why john singletons yg revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is much like the that started the franchise this _shaft_s plot does not score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers contrary what has been reported over the past few months this _shaft_ is not remake of the original but more of sequelspinoff the star audiences know and love from the original and its first two sequels _shafts_big_score _ and _shaft_in_africa_ richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the lies on his samenamed nephew samuel jackson who as the begins is cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds his superiors when privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of brutal raciallymotivated murder is allowed be released on bail disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides take matters into his own hands as p but that is easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright dominican gangster who is hired walter rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness his crime peoplesor rather wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages however he is not so funny as make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn more serious villainy is seamless and believable probably would not have been the case had he been played original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it is no easy task steal from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that is exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless then again such talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn does not quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only wright but all his other costars bale has already proven his ability play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ so it only follows that his performance as similar less exaggerated character would be spoton collette lends the some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan registering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little do in the script credited richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also has little do in sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft does not even have one sex scene that singleton once again proves his ability actors is an especially good thing since he is not really an action director this is not say that he does bad job the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases they move well as does the as whole and are reasonably exciting it is just that there is nothing terribly inventive about them these set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they are unsurprising and conventional but if there is anything that _shaft_ movie does well it is make the familiar look cooland this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive from the slick title sequencescored of course isaac hayes everinfectious oscarwinning theme song singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the filmon the looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world its energetic bravado even common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary style does not exactly make for great but when it comes _shaft_ that is of little consequence what matters above all else is having good time and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides be had this bad muthashut your mouth,1.0
uncompromising french director robert bressons lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malorys morte darthur instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them revealing arthur as weak ineffectual leader and the knights as group of jealous bickering men who failed live up the legends prescribed them chivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of dying ideal bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlins command retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled christs blood bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure the opening sequence is series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights head is hacked off stomach is impaled skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of flaming house since the starts camelot in nearruin and takes only an hour and half arrive at its inevitable conclusion it does not carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films we never get see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall witness but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of kingdom lancelot has always been tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh the greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthurs wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot even when lancelot attempts end the affair guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring lancelots defense it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of mens hearts and minds lancelot of the lake is filled his particular trademarks strippeddown minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and grand use of natural sounds in place of music he uses background music only twice in the during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits the music here is heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the is scored natural sounds that punctuate the films thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest like most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices all the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on given word instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove create emotion through images in some ways this technique works in other ways it does not the final montage of arthurs men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced literal scrappile sums up the entire in one moment however other times bressons uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable for instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs he does this repeatedly opening each shot the same few notes from bagpipe and the raising of different flag while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nevertheless lancelot of the lake is fascinating cinematic experience boldly made master filmmaker bressons style may not be for everyone but one has respect his strength as an artist reevaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema truly personal,1.0

an entertaining hours awaits the audience in this set in the early sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte who are on the lookout for love alice is mousy shy intellectual charlotte is bitchy outgoing and fun we join their adventures as they go through variety of adventures and men all the background of the local disco whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story alice and charlotte are both well written characters and the actresses who play them are not bad aswell sevigny delivers an honest performance and makes the audience feel for her character beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable the huge supporting cast also play part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining the dialogue is sharp and well written many funny set pieces for example there is great discussion about lady the tramp the main characters the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long is good fun the direction is good bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes but their are slight flaws the movie firstly although it is supposedly set in the the characters are very very the way they dress and act have very feel them although the male hairstyles look slightly frankly the atmosphere just was not conveyed is shame also as mentioned above the is too long and some parts do lag the charm of the characters do help these moments but generally the editing could of been bit tighter the plot also sidetracks into silly cocaine dealing bust seemed out of place in this movie finally their are almost too many characters in the and despite the running time the never really spends enough time on them some of the characters are very slight is shame the conclusion while funny is also surprisingly weak and certainly not strong enough but despite these qualms the last days of disco is funny warm movie is certainly worth seeing and is fitting homage the disco era of the worth look overall rating review david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes,1.0

the latest epos from lars is blast although rather moody one this lovestory is situated in small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the something the church calvinistic is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained in these surroundings we find the tobeweds jan and bess played stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess is just bess bit naive and innocent in every aspect of the word at first at the wedding party we are told an anecdote illustrating her infinite kindness she once lend bike an stranger her best friends bike however but bess is suffering in this scary religious society we soon take part in funeral where man fallen off the orthodox path is laid rest while doomed hell women are not allowed attend funerals or speak up in the church when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend almost manic that her friends try calm her down bit the time has come when jan is return the rig bess is falling into the darkness of depression her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves she cannot stand the thought of life without her husband we witness her dialogues god she speaks both parts paranoia convincing god return jan from the oilrig and her prayers are heard an accident on the rig bring him back paralysed from the neck and down now he cannot satisfy her need for physical love he try persuade her into finding lover the ulterior motive make her describe these affairs him in every detail at first she resist but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply imagine what this is doing the poor girl the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted beautiful pictures made danish artist per kirkeby accompanied music from the era procol harum deep purple trex and others the use of handheld camera and lack of any makeup make the characters solid and help separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant though bit too gloomy for my taste would say that it is in the genre of betty blue le matin and bitter moon lunes de fiel emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances this must be the reason for giving it the grand prix du jury in cannes this year although we had hoped for the palme dor the screenplay is now available in print the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may july just in time for the danish premiere,1.0
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases especially hercules emotion all the wacky characters voiced celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences are not going hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core hold it all together not since disneys beauty the beast has there been such compelling animated interesting characters and drama that works the story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the anastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced christopher lloyd her grandmother voiced angela landsbury but anastasia gets lost and grows up no memory of her royal origins the grandmother lives in paris hoping someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family survive the russian revolution young woman named anya voiced meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying put together scheme create an anastasia fool the grandmother and get the reward money they pick anya pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov the plot is actually quite well structured there are lot of complexities that may have be explained the kids later but it moves along fast enough that they will never have time be bored what this really means is that the adults will not be bored it either there is great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the progresses there is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputins pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the however the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly the animation is gorgeous the characters seem come life through the talented animators not since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life them even without the voices they act the musical number in paris is showstopper some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style as all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top singers get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits the songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but that is so much fun it is okay cannot reccomend anastasia highly enough it is wonderful that ranks right up there other animated classics kids and adults alike will enjoy it and it is also nice have quality animated feature from another studio besides disney,1.0
i can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common most people not lot except that both are renowned directors as saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyones production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campions imaginative visuals only serve emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is left everyone says love you not remembering lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put grin on my face left the portrait of lady not remembering lot about who loved whom and could have cared less everyone features nothing allen has not done before storywise woody is again desperately in love beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain similar situations happen his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is what is most important yes the movie would have been betteramong his very best thinkif it had meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight the heart some are tad too goofy such as the number where lot of ghosts prance around in funeral parlor but admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has topflight cast working him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn not quite good allen literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned it this should work wonders jane campion too has topflight cast working for her in portrait of lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing keep the from being stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what did not linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed be reflecting remember very well shots of train its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse do not find myself feeling bad that have forgotten the problem think lies not the cast seemed be trying very hard for the material it was the script that could not convince me care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but found no reason connect any of them understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me care about them have identify them somehow and want them inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying inject some life of her own into the proceedings her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the in the end the movies one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films pretty uninteresting plots and yet was able truly enjoy one of them why both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says love you was able make my heart sing,1.0
you have got think twice before you go see movie title like maximum risk the title is generic it is meaningless and cannot believe it is good business when you pick up the phone and dial how in the world are you supposed remember that the new jeanclaude van damme movie the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed some chinese hot shot is called geez maximum risk yuck the movie itself deserves your attention for sweet bloody thrills this one beats the summer blockbuster competition handsdown only mission impossible came close delivering as skillful thriller and will give maximum risk the edge simply because it is not as slick as the tom cruise picture and therefore more gratifying in its execution much my surprise van damme continues develop as pleasant unpretentious action hero his track record is not as solid as schwarzeneggers but he is hell of lot more adventurous than arnold in van damme worked hong kongs premier hardcore action director john woo on fairly lame movie called hard target if you can find bootleg copy woos radically different directors cut is much better than what was eventually released this followup is directed ringo lam city on fire full contact whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle woos more operatic offerings the surprise here is that maximum risk is more effective action flick than either hard target or woos subsequent broken arrow heres the rundown van damme plays french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when policeman friend jeanhugues anglade finds corpse that is alains exact double turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother michael who has been killed some russian heavies and some strangely american looking cops alain does some investigating he finds that michael had booked flight new york city and received message from someone there named alex bohemia assuming michaels identity alain flies new york and gets tangled up michaels girlfriend natasha henstridge the fbi and the russian mob in little odessa that is as much as you need know the story is adequate but not overly involving and the major plot points are basically explained you twice just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment there is love story too but did not find it terribly convincing partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species she is great look at and she can certainly read line but what she does here cannot really be described as acting of course acting is not really what she was hired for lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van dammes the movie is exceptionally violent bordering on gratuity keep that in mind when planning your date the stunts are spectacular and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive there is only so much you can do car wreck but this movie makes crisp effective use of pileups in handful of frenzied destruction derbies and lam has surprising innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go catch any bit of action the main difference between lam and woo believe is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle gas up his action show pieces lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view make things run do not get me wrong when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on toothpick glass and confetti littering the air around him in woos hardboiled it is an amazing moment but it is moment that is hard reproduce in for one thing does not yet have chow yunfat while woos movies look like the work of talented upstart maximum risk is surprisingly confident picture the very first shot of the is an awkward overhead view of chase through the streets of european city but lams use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on the editing is particularly savvy complement lams shooting style accentuating rather than amplifying the action the performances could have used some fine tuning in particular there is an annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely and the movie does not always overcome the limitations of its genre the story is little mundane although there are some effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had but it is not often that cranks out truly satisfying action picture and it is doubly surprising that this one should come mere whisper of publicity van damme fans should treat themselves what may well be the mans best movie and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid,1.0
in many ways twotg does for toughguy movies what la confidential did for police stories there is savviness in its writing and mature patience in allowing the material unfold but suppose we would not expect less from christopher mcquarrie who was responsible for giving us the usual suspects his writing talents are still in tact as he brings us bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and plan gone awry the two goons are parker and longbaugh ryan phillipe and benicio del toro these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills survive given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime they will always choose the latter yet they are incredibly foolish planners actually these two never really have plan they just improvise along the way hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked their next scheme they cook up about as fast as mcdonalds burger is kidnap some surrogate mother named robin juliette lewis that was hired some welltodo family if all goes well they will receive nice bit of ransom money and life goes on what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying baby for the chidduck family whose patriarch is feared crime boss moreover two bodyguards nicky katt and taye diggs constantly escort her these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations they would rather die than fail thus their bravado level is equally high but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are bit higher and they employ some unusual but funtowatch tactics pull off the kidnapping and outrun the pursuers in sort of slowmotion car chase down series of alleyways the next hour or so we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation during this time additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed because the chidducks can not go the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping we are introduced more characters that will help influence the outcome we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal the cause as result there are undercurrents of conspiracy and elements of betrayal and subterfuge the sepiatoned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks terrific soundtrack emits velvet forebodings shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about occur the momentum and the coolness of the however begins fizzle in the last minutes featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try make their way off the ransom money you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement in fact you may admire this more than you like it yet for the most part the way of the gun stays on target it feels cool its elements of conspiracy and gunplay and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry,1.0

is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal was almost stunned the quality of who framed roger rabbit fun unique look at world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wannabes is getting me you know the spiel lame plot recycled from some wellknown story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekicksidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest few catchy songs few injokes for adults and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke it is formula and like any formula it gets tiresome that is why am delighted hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights the works of ghibli japanese cartoon studio from what have seen of their movies kikis delivery service and the already englishdubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for treat these movies particularly kikis delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kikis delivery service starts an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her leave home this is unusual because kiki is not college student or young adult making her start on the world but thirteen year old girl eager begin her training as witch her mother is also witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt harmlessly throughout the movie kikis mother acts as village doctor and kiki is able do no more than fly on broom kiki must choose city move and what she chooses is the costar of the movie german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she is discouraged and unable support herself though her rudimentary skills as witch on the verge of leaving for new town she uses her power of flight deliver pacifier baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossoms into her working as courier onepersons delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kikis job is catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that does not seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in different light they are three dimensional impossible quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards strange girl however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of medieval city adapted the more modern needs of the this beauty is beauty depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at could probably go on all day but will not suffice it say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorites are kikis relationship the bakers husband although he is quiet never shown speaking kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship in the garage of deliverees house can be found vintage model two old ladies have relationship evolving from masterservant friendfriend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is lesson on the importance of selfworth kiki initially seems derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this causes kiki lose faith in herself however kiki comes realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used do it is so sublime that do not even want hint at it the ending of the movie has subtle charm combined sense of awe and ironically the most disneyesque moment have ever seen if you do not hold your breath in wonder you might want get medical attention the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no songanddance number and kikis pet cat jiji is more friend than comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes however would be surprised if disney does not give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from persons inside and was then rewarded having the beast turn into handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns separate her wardrobe from her selfimage and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the another difference disney movies is in the style of animation for kikis delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but greater attention realism and detail it fits the movie t this is particularly true scenes of kikis flights the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other have ever seen am not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states disney tentatively plans theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that would guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it is good know that it is being released at all for kikis delivery service is definitely movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along man bites dog and perhaps something woody allen this is the best movie have ever seen,1.0

at one point during brian de palmas crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns ranting al pacino and pops question that the audience has no doubt been wanting ask for themselves cannot you stop saying fuck all the time fucking good question that it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers pride but as far as can tell oliver stones script contains the said expletitive more times than any other in cinema history yet it would be shame if bad language is all de palmas scarface is remembered for because this is damn fine gangstar flick the overall structure is similar howard hawks original but this time the scene has switched miami florida and our antiheros chosen vice is cocaine traffiking pacino sporting thick cuban accent gives one the best performances of his career golden globe nominated as tony montana cuban refugee criminal past who flees castro and comes america live the american dream and live it out he does lashings of violence abuse murder and the funny white powder from his earliest jobs as drug runner for various middlemen tony montana makes it clear everyone he meets that he is not man be fucked sorry soon he is the king of the cocaine heap but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing never do your own stash warns one character early in the as sure as night follows day the emperor of miami eventually falls writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here stones script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development montana is fascinating uneducated but calculating straight shooter who speaks from the heart an ambitious violent man yet one conscience man fiercely protective of his beautiful year old sister not wanting her be sucked into the glitzy dangerous world he inhabits pacino is dynamite taking the role brooding bristling energy in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole no inner life only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire have children and even then you sense all he really wants is regular screw and beautiful object show off his friends and she is happy oblige this is not as meaty role for pfieffer as sharon stones was in casino but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well as director de palma sets up number of dramatic scenes his typical stylistic brauva the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations drug deal gone wrong an assination attempt is often thrilling and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola where he differs from say coppolas godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep whereas in scarface de palma opts for grittier feel and it perfectly suits the material the only major botch is giorgio moroders mostly crap synthesier score it is just not right and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes as expected scarface is very violent at times but you should not be watching gangster movies if that upsets you at over two and half hours in length it is true epic and if you are fan of the genre you will love kfilled minute of it,1.0
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs follow firstly fill her life happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location propose finally the groomwannabe should probably get her parents blessing of these four the last one can be nightmare meeting parents is rite of passage fraught unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability make positive impression if you are lucky things will go smoothly but if you are greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc es father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that he is male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg it is definitely not good start but greg is determined win him over and it is this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing say grace before dinner it does not matter that he is jewish if daddy byrnes asks him say grace then that is what he is going gamely do oh god you are such good god he moons his discomfort at trying force out simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility it is pretty hard not grin things get progressively worse for greg and that is too bad because he is genuinely likable guy romantic heart eventually he begins try so hard that he starts mess everything up committing host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people it is neverending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads disastrous circumstances he tries find jacks missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at gregs expense but love often makes person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tugofwar is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry make this an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell,1.0
i like movies albert brooks and really like movies directed and written albert brooks lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies his humor is of kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are films revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films are finding their way into theaters the situations in his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify but even if we cannot brooks has the talent make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenagers and jim carrey fans probably will not find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brooks comedy is intelligent mother is albert brooks latest and it does not disappoint brooks plays john henderson middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then has dinner his brother jeff rob morrow successful sports agent who seems live the ideal life jeff has good job loving family and most of all warm relationship their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witnesses telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened how hunkydory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hints at fault in john and his career every time she talks him and john gives it right back her at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life she says love you and john replies know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way is tantamount nitpicking and guilt loading it is the kind that goes something like yes dear think you do that wonderfully but it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy there is always the big but john believes that his mother is somehow connected his failed relationships women either because of his flawed selfesteem caused his need for validation or perhaps because he tends unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he comes the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in his mother for while just see what kinds of feelings come out and that be able sort out why his life is the way it is great experiment he calls it brooks own brand of humor really shines in this especially in the interaction john has his mother there is scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house and after having driven from los angeles sausalito and having explained his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain me again why you do not want stay at hotel she still does not get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not worry about the protective glaze you have named the ice asks john he is also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as twentypound block of cheese the freezer was good invention says john but it is not supposed be used for everything that is why it is smaller than the refrigerator it is something most of us find strangely familiar brooks is also master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streeps characters are in comedy club having discussion when they are finished and walk out brooks cuts the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have fart go outside you do not know what the joke was because you could not hear him during the entire scene but must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context in this brooks uses the same trick couple of times open or close scene do not want give them away but suffice it say they work just as well as they have in the past johns purpose for staying his mother is learn and we as the audience learn right along him his mother is not the fascinating type begin but as john spends more time her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world in way he is very much like yosarian of catch expect something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect she assumes the part ease even moving and speaking little slowly and is just so adorable it is hard get mad at her character this only helps the audience share the frustration john feels when dealing her as his first choice brooks originally wanted lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning show symptoms of alzheimers disease that may be just as well since reynolds lends softness the character enhances it immensely rob morrow also does good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as mamas boy the only things that hold this movie back from being better are couple of plot holes solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living his mother additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think am some kind of moron john no think your someone who thinks am moron beatrice well it takes one know one,1.0
note there are spoilers regarding the films climax the election of course we see matthew broderick man torn primal state he is been unfaithful his wife lied and manipulated his students and the same token they have demeaned his masculinity his selfrespect his desperate attempt at changing the world and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment tracy flick reese witherspoon no matter how many students have come and gone and disappointed him as an educator she is the real threat about give in and divulge that she is won only lone vote brodericks mccalister turns in defeat sees tracys euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says no the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement all men no matter how obscure have in their relationships traditional expectation of success usurp and surpass women as proverbial industry she cannot go higher than him he will not allow it and what is amazing about election is that every word of that criticism is drawn from rather opaque metaphor early in the we learn that tracy was romantically and then sexually involved now departed teacher it is like payne and taylor his coscreenwriter have taken tracy girl desperate for friendship loyalty and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected their peers that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting an unlikely extreme her as the protagonist and it is amazing the compassion that we have it seems so real us and not merely because it is happened before splashed all over the front pages but because of the all around nice persona of these people we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters it is mandy barnetts if you will be the teacher playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most final viscous injection of bittersweet irony sexuality though is not the only basis for paynes satire or its success it also makes telling point about politics friendship and class boundaries satire is required or ought be anyway take itself seriously or act so while the audience does not it is fine line straddle but some films ignore it altogether drop dead gorgeous leaps infuriatingly mind payne and taylor hit the right chord their characters are real people neither is perfect but rather both of the leads are flawed misguided individuals who retain somewhat noble intentions at heart we sympathize them but still as satire their idiosyncratic behavior and their wrongdoing is taken an extreme for the audience knowingly chuckle but also reflect and meditate about minus half point though for payne admitting not having seen ferris buellers day off whatever,1.0
martin scorseses films used intimidate me because of his reputation felt obligated appreciate them as deep art rather than as great flicks as much as enjoyed them usually felt like missed something learned from scorseses casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required appreciate his movies for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words each other there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him tell the audience what was really going on or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves compress scene of car backing away from building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing do not mean say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking but he simply uses the best tool for the job it should not have surprised me then that kundun about mystical religion actually turned out be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movies title is another name for the dalai lama means ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only few cinematic visions embellish the literal story one of makes an interesting statement pay attention the films opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old his curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of monk wandering in search of the new lama test is arranged see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lamas who have gone before several items belonging the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing boy who could be wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lamas spirit and the future leader of nation it is great weight put on the mind of child in the s it might be grounds for call social services but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming genuinely likeable wellrounded person certain patterns take shape over the years for example the dalai lama is fascinated technology radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys when he is old enough accept his leadership he makes plans modernize isolated tibet he also has soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals it is nearly running gag that he will buy sheep keep them from being herded slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibets gigantic neighbor china tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lamas life is in danger if he stays the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india the story does not lead up cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do it just does not fit that mold if it were forced into such shape it would have been completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet is good in its own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the is made fit the characters and events not viceversa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet mandala tibetan sand painting beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold the bricks are rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice for those who do not know of glass his music is like tibetan mandala his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music are first grouped then repeated in patterns these patterns create interesting textures are themselves part of larger composition people will not be flocking kundun for it is great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have lot offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes warm look at the dalai lama as person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the strong beautiful consistent look,1.0
robert redfords river runs through it is not watch often it is masterpiece one of the better films of recent years until it was my second favorite of all time the acting and direction is topnotch never sappy always touching friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because was afraid it would just be really politically correct and tick me off all could do was tell him go in unbiased and enjoy it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me tears but certain memories should not often be rereleased in the last few shots you have cry upon my first viewing left bawling it is not flawless but it is so very good that you cannot help but be effected the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental watching these shots of people who have been dead so long gives you feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films martin scorsese once described the movies as dream state like taking dope and immersing yourself in an alternative world that is what river runs through it does it exploits the unique power of cinema engross you and help forget your real self both times have seen it its been hard again quote scorsese waking up but the dream is lovely,1.0
richard gere is not one of my favorite actors however like courtroom dramas and this looked good enough take chance on was not disappointed it was not great but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns one thing what is the title not only is it extremely forgettable it does not really have much do the as far as could determine in the long run it will probably hurt the as people will not be able think of or remember it martin vail richard gere is grandiose defense attorney he loves the money and the fame that go along defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drugdealers once he sees that the accused killer of prominent chicago archbishop is babyfaced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press he will get we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is former lover janet venable laura linney vail himself is former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well john mahoney frasiers father on the tv series there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces we see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail richard gere does fairly good job at first he appears be money and attentiongrabbing lawyer no consideration of the truth but we see another side as he becomes seeker of justice and comes believe in his client alfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in standard role laura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable her relationship vail is believable their verbal fencing adds the the actor who playes vails investigator unfortunately do not remember his name is quite good his female assistant she looked very familiar but cannot remember where have seen her was also capable but unspectacular the best performance in the was edward norton he was excellent as the timid altarboy turned alleged butcher boy of st mikes was impressed the depth of the plot there are redherrings and deadends that in lesser would lead predictable ending liked the plot twists the took and most of the supporting characters thus give primal fear respectable rating,1.0
when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated double jeopardy is lurid prepostrous thriller that is also one of the years most enjoyable it is an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has mission and never diverts from it there is not moment here when the events on screen do not have direct bearing on the plot once the gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that is probably correct assessment of the plot but the itself has little in common the andrew davisharrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the getgo and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively seemingly happy married couple son matty age they go out on sailboat one night and after period of some rockin sex they go sleep libby hears strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered blood she follows red trail the upper deck where she finds knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer friend puts up defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes prison once in prison she makes phone call her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing is not even dead she gets some advice from prisonerformer lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they cannot convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they cannot touch her after weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent live at house other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on mission find her husband and get her son back turns out be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her sons adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances it is not like it matters this is rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious it is silly alright but this is the kind of you just do not question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned making sense its sole purpose is entertain and it does judd helps the tremendously in difficult role this is her breakout boxoffice performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion what could have been onedimensional role giving the movie little soul go along its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stonefaced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing romance between libby and travis subplot doubtlessly would have interfered the films story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and took sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system it is great see movie that does not so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it is not the kind of good that is remembered or recognized awards it is one of those movies better viewed the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is thriller that is not concerned being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention the action this year is second none,1.0
let us say you live at the end of an airport runway large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace let us say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home now let us say an airport conglomerate wants buy your property in order lengthen the runway and offers you more than it is worth would not you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed of course you would but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle that is what they are darryl kerrigan michael caton and although he is happy that multinational corporation would like buy his home sorry it is not for sale unfortunately the corporation wields quite bit of influence over the australian government serves darryl and his family what amounts an eviction notice not about take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes determined albeit pathetic attempt fight back the castle an australian comedy rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies have seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest in fact it is this films reliance on simplicity makes it so successful the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets it is the perfect setup for relaxing hilarious good time and as much as hate admit it liked the fact that did not have think all that much while watching this just sat back and enjoyed myself the situation is one we have seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever what makes this different is its characters darryl thinks he is got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next power lines is constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want go out and eat in fancy restaurant when he is got the meat loaf feast prepared his wife sal anne tenny and he swells pride when his son dale stephen curry digs hole in the yard steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers the great thing about the kerrigans is that they are not so stupid that they get annoying they are just group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing we look upon them little bit of pity but whole lot of affection screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against stoic court system and condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the familys wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us degree of emotional investment that causes us actually care about what happens them suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works particularly noted that the writers did not have use slapstick in order get laughs do not get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius it is just that too often will resort it is use as shortcut amusing the audience not always successfully instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed the rest of the world when they are themselves the are funny and when they are normal people they are hilarious one of the few problems saw this was detour taken about midway though the kerrigans go out vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than pack in few more jokes and increase the films running time luckily it is funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the films main drive is still quite enjoyable all the levity abound in the castle the still manages take on pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of citizen keep his property an issue has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world differing outcomes am not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the would actually hold up in real life but it brings the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate and for that matter it is more than would have expected out of light hearted like this,1.0
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent punxsutawney a report on groundhog day the groundhog day ceremony involves groundhog being lifted out of box and if he dosent see shadow it will be an early spring phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind however fate has cruel trick for phil and he starts reliving groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love him groundhog day is well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy although the idea of day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes hold the audiences attention throughout the whole ramiss direction also helps and although he dosent try any flash director tricks the is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries have the perfect night rita the performances are also excellent bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just little bit too sweet in some parts of the there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole would probably fall part chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have like his goofy style otherwise you are really going hate him throughout this and it will lower your enjoyment of the overall the supporting cast are not bad either stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as neurologist in fact there is not one dud performance in this and even the groundhog gets funny scene involving car chase overall there is really nothing wrong groundhog day at all it almost seems perfect however the can get bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated the day repeating over and over and over and over also there is not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all overall then groundhog day is funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart an excellent comedy overall rating,1.0

i rented this movie very high hopes this movie got praise as one of the best films of and unfortunately was not as good as hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking first of all the casting for this is great tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly plot as unbelievable as this you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast tobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters honesty and believability william macy an actor have grown love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife colored person and his friends the noncolored ones he also displays believability and must display certain lack of chemistry his wife he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in joan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom her character is the most ambitious she is very na ve and must display this well make her character believable and she does just that her lack of chemistry macy the role calls for and her developed chemistry jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this would even been even better as said before jeff daniels gives bad performance his character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it enough conviction his character is very confusing and he is not very believable this could have been elevated whole new level had daniels been able give better performance the movie is very provocative it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off such flair that it was mind blowing they demonstrate the racism issue without hitch but do it in slow pace the only major flaw in the besides the performance daniels is length some films are not meant be that long pleasantville is one of those films this could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly it first they are amazed the implementation of color then they want have it then they do not want then the war ensues between the colored and noncolored this is all strung out over two hours was way too long some movies need lot of time saving private ryan was little bit under three hours long and thought it could have used more time this is only two hours long and seems much longer length is everything in films if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle pleasantville can move at good pace at times but it is not consistent enough overall pleasantville is very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days went in expecting lighthearted about change left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change luckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such way make it appeal all audiences only if it could have done in shorter amount of time,1.0
few films in have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parkers adaptation of frank mccourts memoir angelas ashes many dismissed it as an humorless sentimentalized uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel others hailed it as heartfelt sincere portrait of the human spirit am somewhere in between leaning strongly towards the latter it is certainly wellmade and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have tendency be but have feeling that parker filled the movie pseudolyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the twoandahalf hour running time that screams am important mccourts book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us ireland in the early a time when most people were desperately trying get into the us as he comments we were the only irishfolk say goodbye the statue of liberty in ireland frank played joe breen as small child his brothers his mother angela emily watson and his father malachy robert carlyle get financial help from angelas mother stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying northern irishman she helps them get ratinfested apartment and malachy goes looking for job positions are scarce and when he does finally find one he is unable hold on it because of his fondness for drinking meanwhile frank goes an uptight catholic school where the instructors beat students blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires two of franks brothers soon die crippled the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition as if the poverty and the suffering were not intense enough as it stood malachy and angela have another baby worsening the situation further imagine this does not sound like much of plot that is probably because it is not one these are people this is their story director alan parker the commitments knows how tell good story and angelas ashes despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting though the occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting it avoids looking like glorified travelogue supplementing parkers able direction are the engaging often poignant performances of the leads some of them seasoned thespians others relative beginners carlyle the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range hopping from the lead in rowdy slapstick comedy the villain in james bond movie and now sentimental melodrama perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character we empathize the guy but we do not like or admire him emily watson turns in heartfelt sincere supporting performance it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats also worthy of mention is little joe breen whose face graces the films superb poster it is breens first feature and he is extraordinary as young frank not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense you can peer into the characters soul through breens sad eyes on the flip side one thing that could have vastly improved angelas ashes is more decisive editor while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery he and parker also leave in at least half an hour of unnecessary footage the first half especially could have been trimmed down bringing the more reasonable running time and doing our bladders favor in the process things pick up at about the halfway point sort of dismissing lot of the criticisms accumulated during the opening hour but maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary spoiler warning skip next paragraph if in suspense the films final message is somewhat conflicted as frankie in effect leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back america what exactly are we supposed make of that his mother does not seem mind because she wants the best possible future for her son as any mother would but it still seems inconsiderate of him have not read the book but am sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein therefore am suspicious another thing that is never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title am sure is also explained in the memoir if seen as onto itself rather than an adaptation angelas ashes stands tall despite few minor setbacks it is captivating story of people forced live in the trenches an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved the bottom of the financial ladder,1.0

i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not am fan of the xfiles first let me assure you that no prior experience the series is required fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have reach for larger audience therefore the movie is quite userfriendly altough nonfans will only fail understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no am not fan of the xfiles only watch it when nothing else is on and prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend took that opportunity test the movie taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie am glad report that learned nothing new everything you need know is explained the viewer duchovny and others know am going maybe bit too far make my point but everybody should get the chance experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the xfiles is what summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of wooden plank from start finish this movie does not let go of you when compare it last summers movies the best way describe it would be take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time monster scared me that much was when first saw aliens as six year old kid you know when you are affraid put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying cover your throat your shirt so yeah the xfiles is scary and guess what you never even have see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having watch flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the xfiles is monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the xfiles is definately mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has couple of good scenes duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get do much no this is mulders time in the spotlight now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then will not spoil it for you let us just say that due recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there them when they open door or climb hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose if you are confused something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also those people who need go the bathroom during movies do not the person who watched the movie me had go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the xfiles does not need fill scenes between the suspense and the action useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves purpose who needs see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies would recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins nose but the truman show is not what would call summer movie the xfiles is what more do you ask from summer movie other than the chance be excited cool effects it is got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have good time it does not provide answers the show is many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half star well swore never give movie the full five stars so had find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it is pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles give the appearance that mulder had been driving for long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving,1.0

i wish could say that there is something more the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there is not george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again this is the first star wars have seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when watched the three original episodes on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals basically the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets quigon liam neeson and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out the animated jarjar binks fix the mess that may result in war when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing anakin participates in heartpounding podrace one of the highlights of the get the equipment needed fix quigons ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wit is end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders there are hardly any emotional scenes in the even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole wears down the poignancy the size of crumb this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws for starters we have the illconceived moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered threat star wars galactic society and the audience what klutz george lucas clumsily tried create fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda rd or cpo but alas his efforts were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments this is due perhaps the utter complexity this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here the movie seems be reaching for epic proportions cannot say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz the performances they are straightforward and at times stale natalie portman has great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable faults there is so much enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequences does not quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite the is treasure look at the visual effects are astonishing of the time the aweinspiring mouthopening eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius not since the fifth element has there been as drenched in visual treats as this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubricks maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis however all the sets are so original the original star wars movies cannot even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete goldembroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent outrageousness the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie as for john williams score do not think he is done one as complex or powerful since cannot even remember it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving what the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in high expectations and be disappointed there is very little hate in the it is very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun and the best bigbudget out today most definitely,1.0

asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback lebowskis passion is bowling when he is not rolling the ball down an alley towards strike things just happen him arriving home one night he is beaten thugs attempting collect money that his wife owes them even worse they urinate on his rug the problem is that the dude does not have wife his assailants

bag man deliver ransom bunnys kidnappers this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences the kidnappers are impossibly inept the dude and his cronies are even worse every plan goes awry you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries figure out the clues that is the story but tell the truth it does not much matter there could be almost any plot and the would be just as entertaining the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into the dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people you would see on the street but like everything else in this they are not quite what they seem walter is vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties everything that happens reminds him of situation in the nam when fellow bowler crosses the foul line but will not admit it walter pulls gun on him until he marks zero on the score sheet donny gets precious few words

demands an open mind and even more open eyes mark of the coen brothers is that even all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy miss there is so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater felt that the had something important say on further examination was not sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley it is not going be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling maybe there is no real message perhaps it is just roller coaster

here is that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for loop okay it is not quite original considering it is sequel the box office hit species but it certainly is smart most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the and and some even become them however as we learned the smallbudget horrorscifi sometimes expectations can be shattered lot of criticism has gone against this from what have read so far anywayyep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash but the thing is it is not it is well made well acted and quite intelligent can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the but the species series is not about the lack of these elements it is about how much it can get into one and yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it get away doing so species ii begins in the present day though it seems be an alternate universe many films especially scifi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it fit the films needs species ii begins the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars aboard is patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick succeed well it would seem that he has succeeded landing on the surface of mars he is the first human being ever do so of course he is not the first ever about billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able sustain life now of course the red planet is cold and rocky no life lives on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground he takes them aboard and puts them in storage unfortunately one of the samples contains form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior heading back earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they cannot even remember they blame it on technical malfunction back on earth patrick begins have strong urges mate as many women as possible as we know from the original this is because the alien wants breed and take over the planet however the children that are bred are halfhuman as their father is patrick is really looking for another alien breed and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable since she was involved the original alien attack she wants learn how stop the alien should it come again and it has storywise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey love the but you cannot tell me it was strong on story what surprised me the most this was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about piece of rock from mars landed in one of the poles this piece of rock contained fossils may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not living creature that created it the script uses this effectively but also manages provide wellbalanced plot beginning the first man on mars something have always dreamed of seeing was hoping that the would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie and it does it quite well the characters are all smart and they know what do and what not do the only character that seems little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does there are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage the alien series when the mothers gave birth alien children also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someones head being blown off however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including menage troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however tend disagree what were the alien films about and if an alien species ever did come earth and their sole purpose was destroy us would not you mate as quickly as possible as many people as possible my only gripe this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for mate in grocery store did not realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women mate just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of it is vast improvement over the first at least the acting is the key element this if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison films like aliens okay so it is not that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his overthetop impersonation of general makes him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in cage however she does manage very impressive performance this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she is quite fun just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this michael madsen is soso but he is not annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing his nice cynic personality james cromwell has small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been more incapable actor as say any james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the more downtoearth feel and of course justin lazard lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but think he is effective sure he is wooden but is not that what his character is like the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due the couples acting species ii is rated for strong sexuality scifi violencegore and language this is definitely an rated that young kids should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives hell do not even know if will what is sure be critically lambasted turns out be the surprise of the year probably will not see another where was expecting so little and got so much for quite while director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of mediocre series medak has also mastered the wonderful jump moments and has probably the second scariest moment have ever seen on scream still has the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and surehanded director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining,1.0

glorystarring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freemanis the true story of the th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited the north during the civil war broderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle shaw the son of welltodo abolitionists hailed from boston high society the letters he wrote home his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory as the begins in shaw is captain in the northern forces like private eriksson michael fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the warthat is until his company is attacked enemy forces shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving minor wound himself when bullet grazes his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted colonel and assigned enlist and train blacks in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives free their brothers from slavery the periodically jumps between shaws point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers the movie introduces us handful of black recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as runaway slave big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the films intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he removes his shirt receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back is riddled ugly scars from his days as slave it makes your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings tear rolls down washingtons cheekand will probably run down your cheek as well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington was not deserting the army at all he left camp look for shoes because his feet were covered oozing sores freeman is as usual strong presence even in small supporting role he plays grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares remember he quickly becomes leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving as liaison the white officers colonel shaw recognizes freemans leadership ability and promotes him sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher makes an impressive debut in the role of thomas searles free black who is one of shaws close childhood friends searles is educated and refined like white man prompting washington nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough survive basic training and kill in combat the road from marching drills battle action is bumpy one for the black regiment the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them racism and discrimination they are paid only month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for long time they have go without shoes guns or uniforms make matters worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant allow the blacks into action preferring instead use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right fight thanks the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail get them what they deserve even if it means threatening general blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment unfortunately however brodericks uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie in an effort look more mature broderick sports mustache and goatee and throughout the he slips in and out of phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced the places too much weight on brodericks character and not enough on the black soldiers who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground its harrowing depiction of war the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting the unnecessarily graphic gore marred born on the fourth of july glory does not try rattle you nauseating blood and guts except for few bullet wounds and one exploding head the for the most part leaves the gore your imagination is not say that the battle scenes in glory are timid the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it is just that director edward zwick the cocreator of thirtysomething films them far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers the movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals in one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves singing prayers around the campfire each man has chance relay few words of

truman trueman burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature truman also recalls an era of plenty following grim war an era when planned communities built government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans and burbank california brings mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if is the center of the world burbank is or was the center of tvs world the world where our protagonist lives combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman leads the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality comes under attack one day when studio light falls from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying studio light the next day during the drive work the radio jams and he starts picking up voice that exactly describes his movements he is so distracted that he nearly hits pedestrian when the radio comes back normal the announcer warns listeners drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities the world appears be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries take the elevator the elevator doors open up on small lounge people on coffee breaks grip sees truman him and quickly moves paneled door made look like the back of an elevator into place two security guards grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it gets even worse the next day when his wife nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it is best not think about it she says trying vainly change trumans memory truman becomes determined see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped an amazing coincidence that just happens keep him in his own little town his last hope is quell his fear of the ocean and sail the edge of the world you know now that trumans life is the subject of television program his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father the choice of his wife truman is determined find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best keep him unaware and happy it is sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view we root for the captive of the cageworld our protagonist is counting on chaos theory help him escape his elaborate trap the story written andrew niccol writerdirector of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting person this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake although these questions came mind do not think the itself asked them it certainly did not address them or try answer them was particularly disappointed that the did not deal more the trauma of learning ones life is tv show carreys performance at the end showed smidgen of trumans pain but almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing earlier in the movie found myself wondering if it would be better for truman find out the truth or whether should root for him be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol did not see it that way perhaps it is not fair criticize movie for what it is not but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here but on its own terms the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is wellchosen and scored the opens what sounds like family drama theme music when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie ends the score sounds more like frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening glass has small cameo as keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story was brisk there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just few quick title cards few interviews and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart because it was not necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there is also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it is quick straight shot the movies end in terms of overall quality would compare the truman show niccols gattaca both films are well made interesting stories set in interesting worlds but neither really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless look forward niccols next whatever it may be,1.0
