capsule the much anticipated readaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes the screen as dark and little dreary lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there is much like about this version but the approach is take an adventure after the style of gullivers travels and treat it as an action that makes it without much center pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes k monkey planet the novel as social satire it reads lot like fifth book of gullivers travels humans discover planet in the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swifts island of the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly create some suspense in revealing all the things most fans know be true about the nature of the planet it seems me there is also statement about human cruelty animals but perhaps was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into released in he added number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending make it more serlingish the final irony of the original version has become history without it there could never have been planet of the apes series can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how handle the tricky question of language in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done in the but that would have required the entire be subtitled for the nonapespeaking serling avoided this having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that the end of the justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the allimportant question of why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language language they had no opportunity ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the has become well respected in cinema history partial credit at least should go jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmiths best if not his best when the films success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the and while the first had little shooting of guns and what was there seemed little half hearted the second beneath the planet of the apes there was good deal more violence and from that point on the series had lot of violence and chases the series concluded battle for the planet of the apes in now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again for those who thought that the version was not very faithful the book burtons new version is even less faithful first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes that could be good story too but it is not planet of the apes as the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring in leo davidson mark wahlberg not this worlds most expressive actor works on space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes then convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect he quickly finds not greatly any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk is earth english apparently it does not even occur leo that there is mystery that needs be explained about that the fact it does not occur leo and apparently did not occur tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this both just assumed that if apes were going talk the language they would speak would be english in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not look at humananimal relationships and more one of the masterslave relationships outside of sudan and few other countries this is less relevant topic leo is captured be used as slave but also is discovered ari played helena bonham carter ari is an attractive ape close ties high political power she is bent on making the world better place perhaps in previous draft of the script she was called hilari in any case makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in she may want consider this become her standard look from this point forward it is not long before leo escapes some human and only couple of sympathetic apes this is further abandonment of the source material the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society each important in the book we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn this is miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones place much emotional investment in they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason root for them win the script had little subtlety lines like never met an ape did not like but at least we cared for what happened taylor the main character most of what this has offer is in the visuals the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the takes place in the night or in fog this tends limit close looks at the makeup in general it seems much improved from the makeup team is led rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the version in chambers makeup was jawdropper it was realistic enough almost be believable but flexible enough show emotion chambers is good but if anyone had chance best him it would have be baker today audiences have higher expectations bakers visualization is really an improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make they look like they were inspired the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only small group of people closeup since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over stardom in role that required heavy makeup the one actor who has shot is paul giamatti it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes but he delivers them very well he was always watchable actor but has not yet made stardom as the apetrader limbo he overemotes overcome his ape makeup but does it very well in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen he is probably the best thing in the and conjures up memories of peter ustinovs performance in spartacus as an injoke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the and an old ape played charleton heston becomes an allusion the first itself danny elfmans score has nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmiths tour de force score is real classic that score and the whole will be remembered when the is forgotten rate the remake on the scale and on the scale,0.0
i wish could accurately describe the theme music for part the best way can put it is that it is funky know this is an odd question but remember the opening music of police academy citizens on patrol when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song citizens on patrol during the opening credits it is just like that anyway part takes place day after the events of part so technically still this time group of horny teens who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason head up cabin on crystal lake for weekend of sex and weed it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked jason earlier in her life must have been between parts and so why she has returned crystal lake one day after new batch of murders is beyond me she is the lone survivor this time part was originally shown in theaters in and from what can tell from the video it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects jason had long wild hair when he was unmasked in part now one day later he is completely bald also it being one day later it cannot be friday the th now can it oh well steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one in the series r,0.0
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today from timetotime she blows away audiences powerful intense performances on the other hand this is the same woman who made her jawdroppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong and much as lange would probably prefer moviegoers develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality hush is one such example lange is so bad here that she might have been fun watch if the rest of the was not such prime example of motion picture tedium the opens as many socalled psychological thrillers do posing as light drama we are introduced jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow picture perfect young couple who are very much in love jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange the moment first saw martha started looking for fangs soon the wicked witch of the east is plotting way for her son get helen pregnant this involves poking hole in diaphragm once that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city the horse farm where she lives as long as she gets her way martha is perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her it is declaration of war hush has three very simple problems it is incredibly dumb it is incredibly boring and it is incredibly predictable at least up the stupefying ending this has absolutely nothing recommend it the exception of couple of nice shots of snowcovered fields and quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrows bare buttocks frankly it is embarrassing watch respected actress of langes stature give performance like this it is like bad blanche dubois the role she played in tv version of streetcar named desire meanwhile paltrow does her best get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts passable imitation of an inanimate object as in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn here it is mom and against wife jackson caught in the middle of course since schaechs character is poorlydeveloped and badly acted it is impossible say how he feels about being in that situation maybe someone should ask him if he is familiar oedipus martha is of course the evil one how do we know she is evil she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work on the other hand helen is good girl the evidence for this is that she is nice old ladies and treasures locket picture of her dead parents that is about it for character development beyond that point hush is just series of increasingly hardtoswallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists however the first minutes are just warmup for the ending is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying cannot imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as whole liking this conclusion either there was some serious lastminute editing or someone left out few pages of the script before the climax disliked hush the time the end credits started hated it viewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable most entries into this wornout wormeaten genre are not especially good films like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists propel the narrative along in general however they are directed degree of competence that assures level of sustained tension that is not the case really bad thrillers like this fail generate even momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience care indeed the title of this movie probably refers what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid,0.0

certainly no one would rent ed woods glen or glenda expecting see good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays level of incompetence that did not know was possible in fact woods infamous plan from outer space actually seems pretty tame comparison watching glen or glenda found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together as result it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious the movie starts out as what mostly seems like bad documentary endless repetitive narration about transvestites how difficult it is for transvestite look at his girlfriends clothes without being able wear them how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals and how the main character glenglenda is as it reminds us probably half dozen times not half man and half woman but man and woman at the same time the camera work is terribleoccasionally the camera lingers on say closed door while the characters talk offscreen or inexplicably zooms in on someones ear or nose wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage leads voicedover nonsequiturs like yes our world is busy and frightening place so many people driving their automobiles finally there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as sort of omniscient being who seems inhabit frankensteinstyle laboratory delivering pointless lines such as people all their own thoughts their own ideas while lightning crackles quasiominously overhead had wood continued in this vein glen or glenda probably would have been remembered as nothing more than poorly done documentary the occasional inappropriate horrormovie touch unfortunately he then wanders so far off into left field that you have wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script pull the string pull the string announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns this time warning us beware beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door it eats little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails bizarre nightmare sequence is probably meant be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid ensues during glenglenda finds his fiance trapped under fallen treein the living room someone who is apparently intended be the sinister green dragon but looks more like klingon from the original star trek series appears be orchestrating all this though the is far from clear on this point put it kindly near the end of this sceneand here must confess that wood lost me completelyis violent sexual encounter on couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored goofily upbeat folk music after this scene ends not moment too soon glen or glenda returns its documentary style but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone the wanders dumb happy ending that also seems abandon much of what it was trying say about transvestitism but at that point it did not matter much what happened as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over glen or glenda had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent had ever seen honestly think that if picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried make the worst movie possibly could it still might not match glen or glenda for sheer cinematic disaster am giving this movie an but am not sure that quite does it justice,0.0

this is my first review that post this newsgroup and kind of feel like have say something negative about this no one else seems care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken historical story however even if one thinks of it as fiction the prince of egypt remains shallow but will begin from the beginning the biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible whereas the animated version gives the impression of reluctant hero maybe it is just me but if knew had god on my side would have little bit more confidence there are other differences as well such as lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoahs death like it is nothing but thing most of all though the storys focus has shifted rather than being story about fatherson manethnicity mangod the prince of egypt is almost solely about the brotherbrother relationship between rameses and moses was originally excited about this story element until saw the movie where it came off as maudlin rameses and moses squabble like children and then in the interests of peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses was the one who started it yawn did not care anymore the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer of course never happened in the original story moses was exiled but enough about the differences let us talk about the movie itself it features moses who in the interests of making the character more human lacks any divinity whatsoever is not convincing at all anyone who knows who god is it features cookiecutter iwannapleasedada rameses who at least is given dignity the voicework of ralph fiennes from schindlers list among other things the also features an extremely annoying character way of the newimproved miriam voiced the everantsy sandra bullock even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency burst into song for no apparent reason here bullock is replaced singing voice speaking of it contains very annoying music it contains shallow writing it features extraordinary animation is one good thing can say about this most of all it contains an attempt commercialize homogenize and massmarket story about manifestation of god am not christian but got the impression of blasphemy the writers and producers took butcher knife and chopchopped into the story,0.0
for original sin the road the screen has been rocky initially slated for release last november the was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer advance screenings of the were denied all but few critics generally sign that the studio realizes it has dud on its hands so is original sin really all that bad yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards the location settings are gorgeous and there is healthy sprinkling of ta angelina jolie providing the and antonio banderas the more importantly the movie is entertainingly bad veteran readers know that as rule do not encourage people patronize lousy films most of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the let us go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable but things are different this summer quality films put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as am concerned it is fair find our kicks where we may original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but it will do until something worse comes along the adapted director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness was also the source for the francois truffaut mississippi mermaid opens in turnofthecentury prison as jolies character slated for dawn execution tells her lurid tale priest who appears desperately horny the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not love story it is story about love wary of local golddiggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements secure mail order bride from america listing himself as mere clerk dissuade foreign golddiggers practical man luis chooses frumpy looking lady hoping she will be loyal mate able provide him children imagine his surprise when his fianc julia russell jolie turns out be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo julia explains that she sent different womans image because she did not want be selected solely for her pretty face luis then confesses his deception leading julie state great significance we have something in common we are both not trusted after their wedding luis and julia retire for glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking their bodies positioned display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs cover jolies crotch makes it look like he is trying climb her luis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank make his personal and business accounts available julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman whom he corresponded his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up luis must force julia write her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication shortly after julia complains about the chirping of pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage broken neck finally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins suspect that something might be wrong incidentally if you are afraid am giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass along the way private detective walter downs played thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie turns up hired the frumpy womans sister find out what happened the real julia luis is also eager for the detective track down the con artist having decided that if he cannot have her he will kill her oh the pathos of it all the cast appears recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly banderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and those lips she can really pout as for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates snidely whiplash level of nastiness his most startling moment comes when prove his power humiliate he forces luis against wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance fullon kiss if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and laughable potboiler show them original sin,0.0

tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex his boss he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city there lawernce attempts steal his car but no avail and is dragged along robbins on trip arizona there they hold up store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased the police and the other robbers of course there is gags along the way usually from lawernce although the is midly funny and quite watchable there is something so horribly familiar about it all this should really be called beverly hills midnight run there is lawernce his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run it is full of all the road movie cliches and even has comedy car chase just seemed so eighties even the credit sequence seemed be out of steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy there also is not much chemistry between robbins and lawernce in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy in nothing lose there is hardly chemistry at all towards the end the chemistry seems work but for the bulk of the there is hardly any the director directs the in workman like fashion but gets the jokes across and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own lawerence gives good eddie murphy performance and robbins is alright aswell however robbins performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacobs ladder and the player in fact if you want see robbins do comedy much better than in nothing lose suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nothing lose does have some funny moments in it however the humour is not particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this the characters in arizona are funny and there is also good scene where robbins asks shopkeeper threatening approach was better lawerences consisted of lawerence threatening shoot the shopkeepers ass and swearing lot or himselfs was speaking in deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too farfetched and perfect nothing lose then is robbins first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another he nearly ruined carreys career ace ventura when nature calls let us hope he has not ruined robbins or even lawerences nothing lose,0.0
capsule not as bad sequel as crow or batman robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and illconceived this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons extended review you know about halfway through this movie realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes you would have damn fine minutes or so of flashy hong kong style martial arts beautifully choreographed robin shou who also plays liu kang the fight scenes are both mindblowing and graceful acrobatic enough make olympic gymnasts weep this is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson instead they got john leonetti the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat not good choice while the fight scenes are brutal and eyepopping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare the acting is subpar could endure if it were not for the directors style the special effects the treatment of the story and characters mr leonetti should go back lighting in my opinion could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slowmotion he has no eye for action he cannot get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on but far his worst move was the way he treated jumping apparantly everybody can now fly hell am all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena warrior princess in short they should have gotten paul anderson back or at least let robin shou direct unlike the first one whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic mk as special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad counted at least half dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious had this movie been made in the it would have been groundbreaking but in todays industry it does not even look finished now for the _really_ bad parts admit am an avid fan of the mortal kombat series the games are amusing diversions an easy way work off stress and anger the first movie was mindlessly fun thrillride this could have been really cool movie it is not the writers apparantly deemed it necessary lower the target audience from teens preschoolers some of the plot elements are just plain stupid how stupid take for instance how our heroes move around they use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh boy even worse is the treatment of secondary characters blink and you will miss em most characters had more depth in the video games if you thought batman robin was bad about this you as not seen nothin yet good of the characters are introduced kick somebody around bit then either die or are forgotten about there is no explanation at all for this and for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped be the most intricate of the movie lasted about minutes and then just sort of ended it almost made me weep sum it all up rent it on video and fastforward through everything except the fight scenes,0.0

last summer featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters the tune of unanimous critical panning based on the famous television show the was an enormous boxoffice flop and huge disappointment for warner bros year later the studio is up their old tricks again the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west but it sounded promising the same tagteam of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contributed make men in black such financial success is at the reins again and costar kevin kline is attached the project as well as substantial budget spice up the special effects mean what could possibly go wrong the answer is just about everything wild wild west is cinematic abomination that was so entirely pointless begin that it is never given proper chance get out of the gate there are lot of fancy special effects and handful of distinguished actors who try desperately tunnel through the inane plot and make lasting impression but the script is so deliriously uneven the entire movie so off course that no human being or technical achievement has chance salvage it at square one we have bizarre case of casting will smith plays james west renegade cowboy who was originally played white actor robert conrad in the tv series my guess regarding the casting of africanamerican smith is simple one the actor cozy summertime release big bucks for all those involved smith is very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance any comic relief material but this is not an ideal role for him he is too much of joker heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role and frankly that sounds lot more plausible what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role such selfassurance in his eyes you can practically sense his contentment the fact that he knows wild wild west will be huge hit at the summer box office the plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline who are assigned the president recover group of kidnapped scientists the trail leads the diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh man no lower body who speaks in dry witty southern accent loveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control using lethal superweapons destroy entire towns one such weapon is an foot mechanical tarantula bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right the visual effects that bring this metallic bug life are spectacular seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery the western surroundings unfortunately all of these effects seem so detached from the story and can do little support the films plot deficiencies are undoubtedly the main problem wild wild west is running gag that never truly works most of the jokes usually care of smith die on arrival if it is one thing that could possibly be the saving grace it is the performances and even they are mostly offkilter and poorly delivered kline is admirable but he has little do but invent silly devices on the spot salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest because she is viewed as little more than that window dressing look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon branagh an esteemed shakespearean actor and director adds marginal enjoyment the but even he is so utterly weird and overthetop rarely is so lost in itself as wild wild west is suppose there is always one turkey of the summer season highly anticipated bigbudget release that manages completely disappoint wild wild west is such movie and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office perhaps after this audiences will be less assured when they see will smiths name stamped on summer movie after such hits as independence day and mib wild wild west is not an impressive addition the resume,0.0
at the outset of swordfish john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today basically he says it boils down lack of imagination among the majority of writers how ironic as travolta seems be describing his latest venture swordfish is loud violent and amoral it has the audacity justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life and how does travoltas gabriel plan do this robbing billions from his own government and using the funds outterrorize terrorists swordfish is very cynical movie it relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration the movies plot is preposterous enough illogical leaps that if the ever slowed down you would actually see how ridiculous it all is this is liveaction road runner cartoon moving so quickly that it is over before you can catch your breath ask any reasonable questions the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited gabriel crack the governments computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his antiterrorist campaign talk about whackedout patriotism my objections swordfish are many the body count is high but that is expected in movie of this sort it is becoming bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown bits another example is the family dynamics between stanley his yearold daughter and his exwife stanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as loving and caring father forbidden his ex see his little girl audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse showing her as drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husbands adult films thus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time grieve in fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed then there is the sequence involving one of gabriels henchman holding gun the head of stanleys daughter coerce the hacker download the key computer program for gabriel children as pawns have become most unwelcome clich in recent films there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having make them onscreen victims as well yea it is only make believe but that does not mean you have tolerate it travolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the nearcrazy gabriel his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and faceoff jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able create the worm get inside the government database his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriels assistant while don cheadle is given little do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel swordfish plays like comic book largerthanlife character in gabriel viewers align themselves him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain and maybe that is the movies underlying flaw there is no real hero speak of only those doing their upmost survive and that is not enough this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water,0.0

not great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the years least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that as well who barely have time care about anyone but themselves ick real sweet stuff but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared what john travolta went through earlier this summer entitled battlefield earth seemed be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the even if it was on cheese factor as everybody and mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time yipes another beauty so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out movie costarring the everversatile lisa kudrow uhhhm you guessed it not much plot in order escape major financial difficulties local weatherman hooks up his ballpicking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery but as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand part of their winnings and more and more problems arise critique simply stated did not laugh once during this entire picture for comedy it offered me few smiles bunch of nincompoops as characters miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tvs friends this was not as disastrous as thought it would be but it was pretty close thankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the films trailer and not in this final cut and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this also managed feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast foremost was travoltas character who declined give us any reason care for him once in the entire movie and for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong he did not fit the part just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role cool calculating roughneck certain hip suave je ne sais quoi in this he looks like he is trying be funny trying be bad trying be good we are not supposed be able notice that and when we do at least in my case consider it wrong choice in casting add that lisa kudrow boring us yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle play the guy who is not quite up at the same speed level as everyone else and truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and you have got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize the only real good thing that could say about this is that its story was actually halfinteresting and never really bored me also liked michael moores perverted cousin character and loved and say it again loved the character that bill pullman played give this dude his own movie he played lazy cop man who tries everything not do any real work he fakes injuries get off duty tries avoid arrest situations so that he will not have fill out any forms now there is base of humor sadly the filmmakers decided bring him into play only about half an hour left in the and there is not much else can say about this movie folks on the whole it was lame included slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience but get somebody write up movie featuring that lazy cop played pullman and am there,0.0

it is amazing how comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies take adam sandler on the basis of his first two cds they are all gonna laugh at you and what the hell happened me he is the best thing hit comedy since robin williams but when you put him in front of camera it just is not the same kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted marginal recommendation but his latest the waterboy is about as funny as root canal seriously am willing wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here in fact found this movie be more depressing than comedic the first half hour generated not one smile in me it is scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only the cruel football players but also his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming granted after the gets rolling there are few mild chuckles throughout am even willing admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough sustain the waterboy for it is nearly hour and half running time you are all familiar the plot because you have seen it at least million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows hidden talent and leads the underdog team victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves and believe me am not giving anything away saying that sandlers team wins if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be you the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest mean they should be lending their talents some loftier purpose but they do extremely well what they are given here kudos both of them my advice adam is try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made very smooth and successful transition from stage screen rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises make people laugh or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did the recent truman show the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just cannot keep going on like this,0.0
according popular opinion films greatness is determined time take for example casablanca great even today it is still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic another example would be star wars had very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about billion times before but as rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of kinda felt like it was not as cool as when had first seen it had liked it when saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as good escape but when rewatched it felt cheated thus the curse of the event independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for couple kids the critics in this situation but after while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one well this kid is the event in my little analogy and when rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but felt insulted the whole time there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just are not sure if it is comedy or hokey drama one scene you will see hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next you will see bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines the worst is scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like junkyard dog bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda now this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls and independence day has no balls it plays it safe everywhere it throws in ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars mean is not that devils den and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in striptease they are these octopus men boring freaking octopus men mean come on the aliens in were more interesting and you did not even see them basically the plot is straight from bmovie from the aliens come earth and we wonder if they are hostile or peaceful okay it is an interesting topic but it is not handled greatly now they are not and somehow computer geek jeff goldblum figure out they are using our satellites as countdown destruction yep these aliens are not only heavily armed they are stupid too they also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later the president bill pullman who is under attack for being wimp decides this would be nice time be belligerent and he decides he will stay in the white house the aliens have covered do not care if it is bob freaking dole in the white house get him out of there do not care if you have inject him sodium pentathol just get him out of there later on he is stupid and wants fly in the attack on big alien ship think it is time for impeachment for this guy he is more senile than reagan on pot then there is cocky pilot will smith who is the only person survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children the elusive area the films only sign of being brave his girlfriends stripper sharing subplot striptease in that she has do it for her son come on she has fighter pilot boyfriendsoontobe fiance think she can quit that job and get more respectable job at long john silvers she is also the few the proud the lucky survive the igniting of a as well as her dog who narrowly survives there are some bright spots they tossed in enough old homages keep me laughing the best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave and they even played e s it is the end of the world as we know it and feel fine at the beginning and judd hirsch steals the actually acting great he is stereotype but just loved the man anyway but there are no real subtle comic moments will gets way too many oneliners and he has no one play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great as said this has no balls it is just aiming for crowd pleaser and that is what it is but after couple months we all move on the next event while intaking little films and couple indy ones for good measure but at least the indy ones last for lifetime this ones short on batteries,0.0
trying satisfy every kind of viewer it is possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one action lovers will be bored what they will see as an interminably boring setup audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted the films sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and the ending is an insulting copout somewhere out there maybe there is small cadre of filmgoers who will appreciate spheres dubious charms but am not among them sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie no longer read anything either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything go it is hard understand why the rights were optioned sphere is the kind of first class mess that only topline director an alist cast can create expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry levinsondustin hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters something this bad cannot help but look even worse the last time bigname bigbudget displayed this level of ineptitude was last years batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received sphere starts out little like an amalgamation of contact and james camerons the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar another recent science fiction effort event horizon science and philosophy are used good effect during spheres first hour give way mindless confusing action sequences attempts at characterization fall apart intelligent writing is evident early on is replaced hackneyed drivel special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness but all that is just in preparation for the ending is inexcusably awful this is the timehonored deus ex machina device used its worst effect left the theater feeling cheated the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen end the there is some promise but it is all in the setup we are introduced norman goodman dustin hoffman psychologist who once wrote report for the government about what do in the event that crashed space ship is discovered when one is found in the middle of nowhere feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in be part of the welcoming committee on the team him are beth halperin sharon stone biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel jackson mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed the opportunity explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission together the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous temporary sea base on the ocean floor from they will attempt make first contact for while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going take an astute approach the manmeetsalien situation the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities then right around the onehour mark that is the time sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic the virtually nonstop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts make things exciting additionally because none of the characters are wellformed common failing in anything penned crichton who is more interested in technology than people viewers do not develop much of rooting interest it makes sitting through sphere frustrating and pointless experience what about that alist cast not surprisingly the most energetic performance is given samuel jackson but his harry is not person he is walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue dustin hoffman is not lively or particularly good it is ironic that this may be his worst work in decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective then there is queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than handful of lines and almost nothing do other than inflate the body count like think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely be chose make wag the dog as sort of penance the lowbudget picture was filmed during spheres lengthy preproduction phase if that is the case forgiveness is granted am less inclined look favorably upon crichton although he has few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinsondirected disclosure come mind even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichtons credit as producer disallows him absolution he was willing participant in creative travesty no wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early years cinematic wasteland it deserves no better than get sunk the unstoppable titanic should plow sphere under on its way ninthconsecutive weekend atop the box office heap,0.0
shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen it is both humorous and romantic in very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly and and half hours that it occupies that is however not say it is good quality production or anything of the sort shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out be very little quality or original work the finest sign of this may be the plot in looking back there seems be little more than thin predictable plot that is only carried the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books philip henslowe geoffrey rush owns of the theatres in london it is at the peak of the royal theatre era and queen elizabeth the recently damed judi dench appropriately enough queen elizabeth ii is very much fan however directly quote the he has cash flow problems through long set of events it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough pay off his debts so mr henslowe employs the young playwright william shakespeare joseph fiennes pen comedic production however the young writer has severe case of writers block and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well he has the title in mind romeo and ethel the pirates daughter even that joke loses steam after while but cannot seem put words paper then as only could have it through long set of twisted events he meets viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow and falls madly in love thus curing his writers block there are many other little issues that mr henslowe encounters but they all pan out be much ado about nothing the first realization that reached in watching this is that one of the messages given is that show should not always be credited it is author ironically that could not be truer here the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines actors playing actors one of the most breathtaking moments in this does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner but rather young children named romeo and juliet who chose end their own lives in the name of love so it is that am offended the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited writing this production and the name william shakespeare is no were be seen beyond characters name in the credits the acting in this entertaining yet poor is often thin the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeths theatres joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well however the supporting cast does almost save the day geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking they both seem have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this of weak links you will also find very good performance ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting no armageddon does not qualify as real acting and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well but not even they could save this sad excuse for so it remains plagued poor performances when all is said and done shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want be entertained however as the so kindly pointed out entertainment may be fun but it is not necessarily quality and this certainly is not quality perhaps this may be best compared john grisham novel as dear friend of mine often does compare things his work simply put it is farfetched poorly crafted but very entertaining,0.0

working in the motion picture industry must be constant source of frustration for frontline african american actress like jada pinkett smith despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated playing thankless supporting parts low down dirty shame the nutty professor the problem is of course that there are not many good roles available for black women take away the likes of waiting exhale set it off soul food and eves bayou and all that is left is chance be someones girlfriend local whore or murder victim as result for pinkett smiths first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in stupid formulaic romantic comedy the unpromising title of woo actually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy s mayer party girl could have been worse than it is the offers few funny albeit juvenile moments and the onscreen relationship between pinkett smiths woo and tommy davidsons tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two are not forced play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags unfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting the intelligence of anyone tripledigit q the situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sitcoms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment woo is spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places her latest relationship testosteroneoverdosed drugdealer came an abrupt end when she refused wear beeper now her transvestitemedium friend celestrial girlina predicts that she is about meet mr right and that he will be virgo later that day woo is given an opportunity go out on blind date tim shy man penchant for neatness and order who just happens be virgo it is not love at first sight however things get off rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at swanky restaurant enjoy quiet dinner in the onehundred year history of motion pictures there have been ton of bad white movies about mismatched lovers so suppose it is only fair that we get black effort of the same low caliber as in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going end up together the question is are their courtship rituals entertaining in good entry the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is in woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes there is huge one in woo involving corvette broken window that miraculously repairs itself added that is the mystery of how the car looses its top sadly that is one of the films most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional despite exuding charm from every pore there is little that pinkett smith and davidson can do save their characters or david johnsons script since it misses the mark so much better name for woo might have been whoops,0.0

first troy beyer wrote the critically panned a s now she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this subpar about women talking about sex though not without redeeming qualities this is bad the basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love jazz has an idea for local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating she and her friends make demo tape of interviews the women of miami the itself is sprinkled these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters the fact that they are real provides refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the there are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension in lowbudget independent from firsttime director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid that is not the case here the script suffers from random plot developments there are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from at one point character has lifelong reconciliation her mother we are supposed be moved but since the scene is completely unledup we really do not care if she and her mother get along we have never seen her mother before we never see her again who cares what is worse these sudden developments are supposed engage our sympathy at another point character announces that she cannot have children apparently this is devastating we would not know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected be devastated for her the scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow these scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax two scenes were played such overwhelming melodrama that found myself laughing one scene is lovers spat between two minor characters the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax thinking on these scenes it is hard for me admit that the has redeeming qualities but it does first it is original we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and imagine this gives me pretty good idea it is something do not think has been the subject of second the interviews of the miami women are sincere taken together they form mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some womans real experience neither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way at some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true can imagine some people liking this when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole it is pretty bad and that makes it even harder forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension will give beyer one more strike and then she is out rated almost got an nc for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity,0.0

georges polti once wrote paper called the thirtysix dramatic situations in he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined no more than thirtysix different situations this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes there is nothing new under the sun the faculty the latest movie from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical fashion there is not measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream credit gives us horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall making use of cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence daystyle but rather through the back door parasitic aliens take over the faculty of rundown high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up the ensemble of principal characters win the day the lack of gusto is the movies major stumbling block even though the genre has seen movies that have lack for quality such as this they have been saved an energetic approach this casts more than shadow of doubt on williamsons ability who enjoyed success the wes cravendirected scream but could not pull anything solid in for this outing or know what you did last summer although he designs the faculty more of scifi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down the same results throw the stock characters in steel cage match and see who comes out alive on that level the main roles are played virtual unknowns only the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers perhaps williamson has it in mind champion these upandcomers the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but do that they would all need star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty la dawsons creek needless say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be there is moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction make any use of it in sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off,0.0
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending watching one of these movies everything seems make sense until suddenly you are blown away an unexpected surprise when the ends there is moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly second viewing for clarification this is description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out do and more good surprises make movies fun watch then there are the bad twists you either know what is going happen ten minutes into the movie am talking about you reindeer games or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid screwed perfectly suits the latter description what starts out as dumb guilty pleasure should be fun mock group of friends ends complex finale way too much going on the writers of man on the moon and the people vs larry flynt scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take stab at directing whoops screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments norm macdonald stars as willard filmore hard working chauffeur who just wants little respect from his rich old insidious boss miss crock elaine stritch when he overhears her plans fire him on christmas day willard is convinced his best friend rusty dave chapelle kidnap crocks beloved dog and hold it for ransom of one million dollars too excited pay any attention the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends realizing they can make even more money decide stage the fake kidnapping of course everything that could go wrong does the first fortyfive minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad but the convoluted script eventually builds into disaster that is impossible bear the more idiotic these characters get the more reckless the script becomes at one point wanted get out of my seat and yell at these characters no you idiot am not just talking about willard and rusty who were extremely annoying am also talking about the cops in this monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys headed murder ones daniel benzali were just too clueless forgive they give real cops bad names also poor danny devito apparently does not know how turn down role these days looking almost identical his penguin in batman returns every time he appeared on the screen had shake my head in disbelief he just did not belong in this movie macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the much worse than it already was gross out humor is certainly not his forte if you are fan of norm macdonalds other chaotic comedy dirty work you might actually love this nearsequel otherwise do not get screwed out of your hardearned money,0.0
spice world is just one long promotional for the british girl band the spice girls sure there is hint of humor in there every once in while actually there is couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls but overall who cares not me if you do not know now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from lower middle class neighborhood in spice world they ride around in their big tour bus whining about having do photo shoots and give interviews amazingly all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies fun things things they want do not things they are required do keep earning money and they keep babbling about girl power when they should really be talking about cleavage power mean if all it takes is girl power then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits the is pg but really only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions you would have yourself one raunchy adult the way there is something in the opening credits says based on an idea the spice girls wow they got idea credit certainly wish that was new trend in giving credit for simply having the thought say girls let us make movie the supporting cast fares well roger moore the real james bond mockingly plays the clichespewing chief of the spice girls and darn it all he is fun watch mark mckenney also is good as screenwriter trying pitch ideas the bands manager richard grant one question though george wendt you would think that spice world would envoke one of two reactions in people if you like the spice girls you will like them even more afterwards and if you cannot stand them like me then spice world will really make you sick oddly the audience saw the roughly twelve yearold girls sat in silence for the entire well not the two who sat directly behind me they kept muttering this is stupid over and over again maybe there is hope for humanity after all pg,0.0
i read the new yorker magazine and enjoy some of their really indepth articles about some incident they will take some incident like the investigation of mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail it becomes real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of frequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but am being told in more detail than really wanted know often get the middle of story and say ok it sounded good but now have invested more time than am willing spend on this subject is different medium it is visual medium that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize frequently am surprised find out how short script is and how much of the pages are empty space the magazine article and the script are two very different media the insider is adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much marie brenner it is too much an adaptation of magazine article slowed the pace of it really verges on being tedious at least at times for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused host of unhealthy sideeffects but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco the tide turned when former vicepresident of one of the companies was convinced the cbs minutes news team tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking the resulting pressure stop the story created small civil war at cbs who were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway that is the story covered in surprising detail the insider this all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that stylist like michael mann would be likely do well and in the end he failed make long story short the needed director who knew how make long story short the opens the cbs minutes team in iran the assignment interview terrorist we get taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists the actual interview mike wallace played christopher plummer there the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away it this seems have nothing do the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder manipulate than committed terrorists we have wry irony on who really has clout in the world terrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power incongruously intercut the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work his home we discover that he has been fired and his career brought complete halt unexpectedly he had been very profitably rewarded vicepresident in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money support his family rather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed do for income meanwhile the minutes team trying do story on fires started cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand they offer wigand just interpret the data wigands severance agreement swears him secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms he is willing read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman in spite of the secrecy wigands former employers seem immediately know wigand is talking minutes and he is warned off former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role and so the game begins wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued be loyalty his agreement and his former employer meanwhile someone is playing very rough wigand and his family the examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants wigand has always wanted make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies getting the story out he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider the story is told slowly and in just bit too much meticulous detail the is minutes and is an extremely demanding for the audience the musical score pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too wellknown for even so good an actor as plummer play him convincingly this might have been really engaging experience under another directors control michael mann was the wrong person helm this and the insider lacks intensity because of his style rate it on the scale and on the scale,0.0
i should have known damn it should have known ewan mcgregor codename eye is pointing hightech riflely gadget at fat bald businessoriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in window across the street we get the requisite electrogreen throughthesight view we the audience seeing high tech riflely gadget of course think that eye is going assassinate the target but instead he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy lowquality photographs eye then proceeds fax and email everyone in his targets office all right so thirty seconds in was slightly befuddled this seemingly pointless riflecamera but was still open minded maybe there is really good reason for it have got reason believe you see admire lot of ewan mcgregors previous work and he is obi wan ke frigginnobi for gods sake and director stephan elliots last movie priscilla queen of the desert was quirky little delight there is some genuine talent involved here think at the twenty minute mark there was still spark of hope in my heart eye has been assigned investigate the leader of his organizations son still have no idea what this organization was british intelligence national spy ring private investigation who is apparently stealing from his trust fund he has received his assignment from d lang through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase when eye tracks his target an expensive looking secluded house he witnesses mysterious and beautiful woman ashley judd take knife out and proceed stab the poor bastard ok that is odd think myself this could be interesting then she starts cry and through her tears exclaims merry christmas dad for the first time so begins our tale of obsession or something the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregors eye character following ashley judd around every corner of the united states totally and completely obsessed this woman from afar throughout his entire professional life he has been voyeur so when he falls for someone the only way he can handle it is watch and drool through telescopes and cameras fine that is lovely premise suppose but gosh darn it if you are going go there you better have some sort of explanation and that is precisely where this fails this is the kind of movie that pisses me off it is an abortion collection of halfformed and wasted ideas that amounts absolutely nothing in the end it pretends it is something that it is not surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in hightech thriller here the filmmakers have confused surreal and deep vaguely unclear and crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors never even for an instant had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in love this woman who changes wigs and kills people the movie offers only two explanations neither of make lick of sense explanation number one the obnoxious presence of eyes imaginary daughter who was taken away from him his wife some time ago tells him he should not leave ms judd explanation two the end of the has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie beauty is in the eye of the beholder whoo hoo that helps thanks bunch case closed that is as deep as it gets folks there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes instead of tying everything together ends up being as profound as clever sixthgrade mad lib there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except make the audience wonder what the hell the point was my personal favorites include the prisonmatron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina who apparently taught ms judd everything she knows about wearing wigs jason priestleys awfully played dirty desert vagrant who tries emulate dennis hopper la blue velvet but fails miserably and the copwhoseesashleyfleeinganaccidentsceneand thenwantstopayforsex butisshot each one in this sad little parade is little more pointless than the last the script pays no attention the laws of time and space any time one of the frequent location changes occurs the camera zooms in on souvenir snow globe and minutes weeks or years could have passed bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair one character passes glass of cognac another in slowmotion closeup awash in lot of bass ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened the giant bell jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks then laughs maniacally cut random guy eye patch iguana out of focus iguana comes into focus wow man when found out afterward that this was based on novel it came as no surprise me there are plenty of elements here that if extended and fleshed out more would have made for decent story and would not be surprised if found out there was an hour and half of footage cut from this movie lying in landfill somewhere or waiting in the wings for the dvd special directors cut not that anything would ever possess me purchase such thing find out what was missing the last ten or so minutes featured conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed be some sort of revealing exposition some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone and this time did not particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was steaming pile of unholy crap the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar what was thinking someone near cellphoneguy did eventually yell shut the hell up but it was lot funnier when we thought he was talking the

vampires is rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only pleasure men feed vampires readied be bashed or beaten till ones sensibilities is shocked the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half the dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion james wood portrays jack crow man obsessed killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires as for adam baldwin he is nothing more than stooge who is ordered beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked avoid much offence against the female sex as for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury enough blood spilt make the inquisition look tame an awful movie on all counts my suggestion is bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers,0.0

let me just start this review off saying am huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years am not too fond of ted turners world championship wrestling however and am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for wrestling movie tonight the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs david arquette aptly cast as neandrathal and sean dawkins scott caan who are so obsessed professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than flashy show when they finally get see their hero wcw world champion jimmy king played oliver platt personally would have gotten wrestler play king he ends up getting screwed over evil promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff they will agree me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it they embark on quest find him and help him get his title back when they find him they discover in horror that jimmy kings real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv king is drunken atlanta native rather than an english king after convincing king that they do not care that his persona is not real gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro after sinclair agrees book him in main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcws payperview gee whiz there are so many things wrong this movie do not know where begin yes do the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff wcw president who thought up this project thinks of wrestling fans he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough believe this is meant be taken seriously got news for you eric nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that this is you know not know he will probably cover arguments up saying it is not meant be taken seriously but it is because that is how big an ego bischoff has there was documentary made in wrestling shadows that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation vince mcmahons screwing bret the hitman hart out of the title this movies storyline is basically comic ripoff of that plot the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in eric bischoff is trying make vince mcmahon look bad the character of titus sinclair but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon and that vince did what he had do bret hart the movies main wrestler jimmy king has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age we want bad asses today why make this comedy instead of an emotional rockystyle drama know wrestling is not sport but you can still get behind guy who struggles as wrestler and finally makes it in the end in the movie gordie starts up an illfated romance nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan what she sees in that freak marilyn manson will never understand only find that she has hospitalized kings trainer for sinclair would not it have been easier just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spygirlforthebadguy cliche hate that last but certainly not least there was not one single moment in this movie that could not predict would happen nor did laugh once either the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company make the movie for these reasons they are the better promotion they have better and younger talent performers and wrestlers they give their fans what they want and do not treat them like idiots they are winning the ratings and they are the promotion everybody cares about simply put they could make movie hundred times better and they could do wrestling movie the right way the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end and if spoiled it for you good saved you from wasting seven dollars,0.0

even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves down periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of corrupt officers james coburn plan get him out of the navy like any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him group of misfits like the guy who wants be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who does not belong there lauren holly the secondincommand who does everything the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on then comes the transparent plotline first grammer has fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy sad sight gag montage that includes guy mop knocking schneider overboard after the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who cannot connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone finally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has lead his men and holly overcome the other ships in wargames exercise and he has be clever rebel do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability first they are singing louie louie like bunch of drunk sailors throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later they are making whale mating noises throw the radar of the other ship off the whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too it is all predictable without any original humor redeem it the jokes are right out of mchales navy and other cutrate sitcoms of the past there is one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in yelled back at the screen so did these jokes watched this movie the whole family and everyone hated it my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour started writing my will the blame cannot really be placed on the stars though kelsey grammer is good in this he just does not have anything work his character is said have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis grammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed appear in movie he knew nothing about same for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because she is so gorgeous as for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere go but up after surf ninjas although he is still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as formula comedy okay it is police academy in the navy frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into disaster judging from the video box most other movie critics agree me the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson guess even jeff craig from second preview who said tank girl kicks butt without ever seeing it did not like this,0.0
movies do not come much more ridiculously titled than still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as warning more than sillysounding mouthful blurt out the ticket vendor this horror sequels moniker also contains grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able spot what you did _last_ summer you actually did the summer _before_ last summer and since knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer it is really illogical say that _still_ know what you did _last_ summer the filmmakers would have at least made sense the shorter still know the longer still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked bits that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this do things that are the polar opposite of smart for example if your roommate is plagued terrible nightmares as result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just locate and borrow cute little dress probably not but that is precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in long line of phony frights julie you will recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of surprise hit know what you did last summer after slasher grudge bear it is _long_ story began trying pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins trip the bahamas and julie yet racked guilt decides that maybe tropical getaway will help ease her mind yeah right their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the stillalive killer muse watson from the first he sports the same gortons fisherman getup heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why he is still trying stay anonymous is mystery this movie never solves though suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of leisure suit in sense that is the movies glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained its prequel the murders and attempted murders in that were vivid and scary but trey callaways derivative still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims when julie lays blissfully unaware in tanning bed giving him perfect chance wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do he twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays you would think he would want her gutted now instead of skin cancer victim later even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into know unfolding story is sorely missed replaced the grating antics of white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo you will cheer not shriek when he ends up pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest if know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly still know what you did last summer deserves fullblown roasting on mystery science theatre,0.0
synopsis humorless police officers life changes when he befriends supersmart superadorable golden retriever named einstein and cute young blond scientist unfortunately einstein shares psychic link bigfootsized apecreature trained the blond scientist be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl meanwhile group of white chainsmoking guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries kill all the other characters in the movie comments watchers reborn cheaply made directtovideo turkey is the fourth sequel the first version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers technically this should have been called watchers but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequelcrazy series has decided drop the numbers from the titles even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi the makers of watchers reborn probably want fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be good movie instead of crappy fifth installment of series should have died long time ago this really is not good movie have you ever rented movie and recieved sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation well any hope viewer may have had perhaps because he is fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed the time he is seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn they are awful these commercials cover films like strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio scott baio what idiot dreamed this movie up after surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets watch the movie he rented watchers reborn maybe it will not be that bad he may say himself perhaps just perhaps the bottomofthebarrel fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading watchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote decade ago it stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy lou rawls is even in the mix unfortunately the force is certainly no longer mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements watchers the book the latter is really too bad koontz is hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer koontz has writing style is succinct and suspenseful people who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices it is definately not koontz book if there is not psychic superintelligent dog or psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs watchers has all three devices may explain why it is arguably the most popular of koontzs books the idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible is very interesting basically biological war machine is created smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the targets position psychically large creature designed kill in handtohand combat silly but kind of neat too am sorry do not mean ramble on about matters not directly linked watchers reborn the movie suppose just do not want talk about the movie itself this turkey is really cheesy no one in this movie can act including mark hamill and it is difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying be the hero the cheese factor is only increased when he is involved in an implied sex scene the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshe issupposedtobe whom he befriends mercifully the filmmakers opted not do nudity be honest the only halfconvincing actor in the is the golden retriever who plays einstein you know movie is bad when dog outacts all of its human counterparts find it difficult relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie and the creature yes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in furry suit and mask poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling this creature is shot about times but it is okay the creature has the ability kill people swinging his arms around and pushing oh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around cheesy gore that is another main element of watchers reborn it has many bloody scenes are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense ultimately gave watchers reborn star and half because bad horror scifi buffs may get few kicks out of the films silliness though this will tax even their patience it is an minute but it feels like four hours also hate admit have survived far worse than this anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what mean finally could not help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows mystery science theater this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn smile on my face rated watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore it also has violence obviously would not recommend it for the little kids but am sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay instead of watching this however recommend reading koontzs book trust me it will be time much much better spent,0.0
you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the odd couple ii sneak preview they were as happy group of men as have ever encountered what great movie exclaimed one gent at the urinal everything was so true yeah laughed man standing next him drive as slow as that one guy did my kids give me holy hell for it and peeing is big part of my day just like felix chuckled another fellow as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared rejoin his wife if you are over and in the habit of driving at least miles per hour below the posted speed limit neil simons the odd couple ii may be just the for you others will likely be less charitable while the odd couple ii is amiable enough neil simons shockingly lazy screenplay feels like slappedtogether tv reunion show suffering from wheezing situation comedy setups and jokes straight out of the borschtbelt simon once the toast of broadway has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way the neighborhood multiplex in branson missouri the contrived story involving the marriage of their kids provides the excuse for reunion between oscar madison and felix unger who have not seen each other in years the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and quite literally run into one another at the airport they take off in rental car for the ceremony in san molina get lost and have series of wacky adventures on the road jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair the impact of their reunion is lessened the fact that they have headlined three films together since grumpy old men grumpier old men and out sea still the two veteran actors are fun watch matthau whose magnificently rumpled face looks like big pile of laundry eyes has field day as oscar the crown prince of the curmudgeons lemmon looking pastier than usual is fine as the ever annoying felix who still punctuates his chronic whining occasional allergic honks of phnah phnah despite their bickering the characters have real affection for each other providing welcome respite from the nonstop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together unfortunately matthau and lemmons charm is not enough compensate for simons hack script would not pass muster even on upn sitcom one contrived situation follows another lathered enough stale one liners supply dozen wouldbe comics on openmike night at the local comedy club if someone drags you this and you find yourself as bored as was try entertaining yourself counting the product placements burger king gets one as does the el pollo loco taco joint but budget renta car really hits the jackpot between script references their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name could not keep count of all the plugs did however keep track of some of the swearing came up four goddamns three shitheads and two fucks the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for aimed at an older audience but the theater full of seniors appeared have no problem them howling like crazy every time the boys let rip naughty word it is sad that writer of neil simons stature has grown desperate enough resort swearing for cheap laughs but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise one running gag involves oscar and felixs inability remember the name of the town where the wedding is be held at one point the men actually spend seconds just freeassociating riffing off variants of the word san the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing one of the oldest maxims of filmgoing is beware of movies that use the authors name in the title neil simons the odd couple ii is no exception the rule while the production has enough minor pleasures warrant tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon it has no business playing in movie theater of course there is bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree every word have written and would probably whip my youngwhippersnapper ass boot one things for sure though they will never catch me in car chase,0.0
the army comedy genre has never turned out truly good movie if you do not count neil simons biloxi blues year after year more predictably cliched military movies come out most recently sgt bilko and none of them ever manage be anything more than rehash of the last thought stripes would be different ivan reitman as director bill murray as star and harold ramis as costar and coscreenwriter it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army instead it was bunch of unfunny crap in the army murray about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs plays loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success and convinces his friend ramis enlist him so he does and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell headshaving and marchingsinging sequences more mindnumbingly stale here than ever the characters are even less original ranging from underachieving slob john candy incompetent captain john larroquette all the big name stars in stripes and even larroquette fall victim the lame rehashed material and are never really likeable murray in particular he only gets few decent lines in although those barelyfunny one liners pale in comparison the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters he was even better in caddyshack for crying out loud as lot of the late early comedies stripes is completely juvenile movie only child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able watch it am sure it seems funny on paper have candy pay over mud wrestle five beautiful women but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition dear god every few seconds stripes is not the playful kind of sex comedy either most of the time it seems downright misogynistic as when larroquette uses his telescope peer into the womens showers or murray lifts female p onto the stove and an iknowwhatyoulike look on his face says he is going give her the aunt jemima treatment means shoving spatula under her butt repeatedly you do not want stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region am not enjoying this the woman protests my sentiments exactly,0.0
mercury rising has numerous flaws but there is one that really stands out its central plot device is unnecessary that is right the major aspect of the that is supposed make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better this central device is the fact that nineyearold boy is autistic his name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked supersecret government code slipped into the back of puzzle magazine its programmers just see if someone could beat it simon is intended be the heart and soul of the and we are supposed feel for him because he is poor handicapped child thrown into violent unfair world against his will only renegade fbi agent played bruce willis protect him the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of mercury rising suppose the original novel upon the movie was based did much more this aspect of simons character and his relationship willis but here it is lost miko hughes the young actor who plays simon goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic he walks slowly drawls his words kicks and screams when he is touched and has hard time looking at other people it is difficult role for an adult much less young child play and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he is not playing like he is autistic unlike dustin hoffmans performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprios in what is eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting however unlike rain man used its characters autism in unique and interesting ways build credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about its generic predictable plot simon being simply really smart but really shy kid hell he does not even have be shy in fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm willis character art jeffries is disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening wiretaps rookies who are happy be doing anything he becomes involved simon when he is called check out murder scene at simons house where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide of course we know that is not the way it happened happen because we saw an evil squarejawed government hitman meanlooking crewcut knock off the parents simon was able get away and jeffries finds him hiding in secret compartment in closet the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked jeffries who is accused several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it knows there is something more and he makes it his personal mission go against everything and everyone in order protect simon this is quite task because that same hitman who knocked off simons parents is crawling everywhere attempting kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he goes late in the movie jeffries is forced enlist the aid of pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meets at coffee shop of all the hardtobelieve aspects of the movie this is the worst can believe in the decency of the human heart but staceys character is far too accommodating not only does she agree watch simon while jeffries runs off solve the mystery she lets him into her apartment at two of the clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him and then lets him leave simon in her apartment means that she has forgo business trip that is desperately needed pay the rent the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point the movie might have been redeemed some good action sequences but even here mercury rising does not rise the challenge the movie was directed harold becker who has made some good suspense films including sea of love and malice but his talent is nowhere be found in this latest excursion there is one fight on streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that had no idea exactly where they were on the streetcar who was hitting who and where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were the grand finale takes place on the roof of tall building and features harrowing yawn scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building not because he has but because it is more suspenseful that way taken as whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lacks style wit and any traces of sense of humor usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor his roles but here he is too straight and serious this is because the movie wants be an action flick and heartfelt drama at the same time but it ends up failing on both fronts maybe the book was better but the way it is handled here is perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed bore,0.0
i have never been star trek fan and tell the truth out of the five films in the series that have seen have disliked all of them do however always go into one of these an open mind and the ninth in the series star trek insurrection is no exception dropping almost completely the hardcore scifi element of the previous one in the series first contact insurrection tells the story of planet that holds only people known as the baku as well as the fountain of youth at the start of the picture the villagers go under attack second alien species known as the sona who want push all of the baku out so that their own race will not die out also attacking the baku is data brent spiner robot from the star trek enterprise after returning jeanluc picard patrick stewart and the gang on their space ship no one can understand why data was somehow taken over another force so several of the star trek members travel down the planet of the baku where picard meets up and starts fall in love one of the inhabitants sultry kind alien woman donna murphy who is over sixhundredyearsold but looks only be in her thirties star trek insurrection is completely unoriginal and cheaplooking installment in the series and is big step down from first contact at least appeared try make something bit different in insurrection however it plays like lowrent episode of the television show due the smallscale generic storyline and an emphasis on oneliners rather than excitement the was filled nearly nonstop comedy and worse yet most of it fell flatter than cartoon character that drops off cliff meanwhile when there were action sequences they were not at all interesting or inventive relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very very slowly this plot device is seen in just about every action made nowadays is getting old fast are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have timer ticking away during the climax another element of star trek films in general is that picard seems always have have love interest but then she always miraculously disappears when the next is made two or three years later although donna murphy who falls victim this thankless love interest role here is actually one of the few characters that we get know in the minute running time alfre woodard was far superior in first contact she should have returned for this one but do not blame her for not wanting waste her time this movies disappointing and often lifeless screenplay michael piller star trek insurrection is perhaps the weakest in the star trek series although have not seen what is widely considered the worst star trek the final frontier insurrection is the type of safe sequel that will bewilder nonfans since it is so lowtech compared most of todays blockbuster action films although most of these are honestly not very good either and should disappoint the loyal trekkies since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed go through few more drafts on second thought they probably should have completely thrown the script out that way they could have come up story that at least had sign of intelligence and freshness,0.0
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on the inexorable hasten from the major studios please kids everything they think kids will go for disburse their seven bucks and once again we have one of the worst films of the year the trend of the moment and bear in mind it is trend not movie is spawn and if you have seen the animated series on hbo you will recall it embodies the lost life of disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment he is been sent hell todd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about bewildered individual who must take on group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after while every character in this is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written depressed college student the story begins like in every superhero movie in this age man living an idyllic life al simmons michael jai white government agentassassin shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has tongueincheek wiseass partner terry b sweeney and is content the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him the next element in the is the part when things go awry and as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended jason and dies in gory and truly sickening scene inevitably it leads everyone the conclusion that he has passed away hence jasons mischievous mastermind plan conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes pact satan himself agreeing command the devils army take over the world and he gets see his family again so our pal al has been uplifted hell and while his transformation from normal guy spawn takes place his ol partner terry forms relationship his wife time passes and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc this character is merely poor mans obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla now the stage is set spawn the new enemy of evil vs evil and evil takes the cake doubtlessly john leguizamos deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the films relief point all this anguish pain halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character is basically compilation of soso one liners and then there is martin sheen whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent as the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like bad dream out of bmovie scrambled and left in the shelf rot this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street would never thought would be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheens career is in better shape spawn is movie in realism or even an attempt draw parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable for most of the the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises even batman and robin accomplished better it constantly reminded us we were watching superhero movie very bad superhero movie continually the kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry the filmmakers seem have forgotten every human element possible the quality of this is abysmal and insulting it is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted touch the psychological chord that tim burtons batman did touch the desperation of man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act but bruce wayne had human elements him he was pensive resourceful and had relationships made our perspective on him equally human the character of al simmons seems be longing for drastic change as if he is fatigued about being normal and as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians make us think they are extraordinary none of this is present in spawn the fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is pennydreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runners as an example of this films vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided include poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued spawn so our emotions tend be little more sympathetic admittedly did laugh once in the and that is when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as bum it is no wonder why so american children grow up no engrossment for art or literature besides blaming large portion of it on the laughable school system condemn the other part garbage like spawn movies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected and kids will continue see films like spawn simply because they are unable differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous from an insipid and wasteful one children are not muppets and spawn unapologetically targets children,0.0

i have always been fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as the company of wolves the crying game and interview vampire his latest the butcher boy is return his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not successful homecoming told through the eyes of yearold irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar follows him as we learn little about his decidedly unstable life his father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden see him anymore francis is the type of boy who always has lot say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be little psychotic even capable of brutal murder the premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into thoughtprovoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works francis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the was distancing itself away from him when suspect we were actually supposed sympathize him this is definately not young owens fault however because he gives brilliantly accurate performance and is able also seem menacing as well the fact that we do not get close his character is because of the sloppy screenplay the supporting characters are no help though rea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks his son or anyone else for that matter he usually seems just be sitting watching the television throughout shaw has little bit more work since she has one touching scene in she talks francis in time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning know her and singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice the pacing is all off in the butcher boy although the story could have been dynamite it moves at deadeningly slow rate and found my mind wandering every once in while it is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly no satisfying payoffs at one point francis is sent away juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins develop between priest and himself but nothing comes of it would rather think of the butcher boy as brief diversion for director jordan rather than total misfire he has already proven be strong director but he lucked out this latest what could have been courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages be an ineffective uninvolivng bore,0.0
as you should know this summer has been less than memorable total of decent films it is not surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on the th warrior will be the is based on the michael crichton eaters of the dead in ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at wife of king after tarveling for many months he comes across gang of norsemen who are forced pick men protect town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog so they start picking men and are left without thus ahmed is choosen so far it sounds interesting right not when all of this takes place in minutes after that they basically run around killing that alone shows how much script is needed for because once your story is introduced you have the rest of the start developing it obviously that is not the case here even if you are going into the expecting an action packed adventure you will be disappointed since all the action takes place in fog it is constantly hard see scene clearly due those circumstances and poor camera work cannot the camera men sit still would like actually watch in focus but again they failed deliver that as well the moves on and on until the point where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you are eating corny dialogue that the characters laugh at for some odd reason script that goes nowhere dull action sequences predictable ending and worst of all weak characters there is basically nothing like here except for maybe the set designs that is the only thing that honestly caught my interest when heard that john mctiernan the director wanted his name kept out of the project that made me wonder why well now know crichtons greed forced mctiernan edit his finished product led big arguement what is there argue about anyway the could not be saved no matter how much they spent or casted seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money would not be surprised see the th warrior become hit please do me favor and save your money at all costs or else you will be lost in the fog like the itself,0.0
if were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films might say that review movies that do not look particularly good because am doing service my readers warning them against seeing it if that were true could put banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you do not have but know that is bunkyou are going see whatever movies you want no matter what say so have tell the truth every once in while get nasty masochistic urge see bad movie you know the feeling when you are sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want see something you can have ball trashing mercilessly sometimes think that is why anyone goes see pauly shore movies ever admit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies so do so saw supernova truth be told supernova was not quite as bad as thought it might be maybe just felt sorry for the actors or maybe thought it could have been decent if the studio had not started tinkering the directors walter hill final cut causing him want his name removed maybe am becoming softy in any case did not find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe but it is still bad the takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale the crew includes captain j marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz there are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has shady past involving drug addiction puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love the computer apparently female do not expect any more explanation because you will not get it anyway the crew gets distress call from location deep in space failed mining operation had been sent during the dimension jump think that is what it is called but do not hold me it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board he calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of man kaela once had relationship then bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening have you seen alien have you seen event horizon lame movie in its own right good then you have seen supernova postproduction cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either after all no ones going think for second that troy will not turn out be villain but the bigger problem supernova is that it can just stick the simple plot it is afforded numerous rewrites the script may be credited three people but it is gross underestimate have crammed this lean minute tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped was there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot did the ships computer learn something about humanity what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board him and just what does the films title signify if anything as far as can tell it refers very small plot detail that is not developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements character relationships in this also make very little sense for some reason every person in this keeps having sex we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first minutes bassett and spaders characters start off hating each other fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they are engaging in some hankypanky when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love him every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly is only one of the many obvious clues how much this has been cut the most prominent example however may be the fact that when the starts there are no opening credits furthermore the end of the looks like they took what were originally intended be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits maybe that is why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you are seeing lest you decide walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems have dropped you right in the middle of scene littletono introduction any of the characters or situations the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point point point danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready have his baby point tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed the lava lamp thing does not make sense since did not understand anything about these characters motivations did care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone and he does knocking off three of them in about minutes not whit it is shame because this cast contains lot of talented actors looking for something do they do not find it bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice the same blank expressions on their faces sexual tension more like constipation maybe they are just embarrassed at having utter such howlers as this thing was made someone more powerful than god and whole lot less nice not that we ever find out who that is mind you the climax of their relationship taking place in transport pod is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper as troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected he awfully onenote but it is not as if he is given any more notes work the rest of the cast does even less tunney stands around looking cute then scared phillips broods cruz flirts the computer then they all die and star blows up or something but really was not paying much attention then supernova is pretty awful but am cutting it little slack merely because expected less than what got that is it if you expect it be good for whatever reasons you may have you will probably hate it more than will even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice say the script is not going save the honestly though what do you expect from about dozen writers and director who had his name removed and replaced pseudonym it usually results in bad movie and that is what supernova is,0.0
for timing reasons having do baby sitters we recently went multiplex and saw undercover blues would give it one half of star for guts anyone in movie this bad would have have guts later read ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show the script was the worst part they had characters who talked funny accents in an attempt make you laugh they had lots of great sight gags like two people trying go in door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on game show the good news is that we were smart enough vote our feet and left buy some tickets and give them your worst enemies tell them the show is great and smile lot one of the top few films of this or any year must see excellent show look for it average movie kind of enjoyable poor show do not waste your money one of the worst films of this or any year totally unbearable review written on september opinions expressed are mine and not meant reflect my employers,0.0
the obvious reason for producing sequel an immensely popular movie is acquire continued profits the rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is shoddy product that is exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is last years speed and scream as well as this years species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory in some cases sequel can even discredit its predecessor as the latest neoslasher flick still know what you did last summer whatever uniqueness the original might have had now seems trite and overplayed when paired this abominable thriller julie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original star in still know reprising their roles in typical fashion julie and ray experience rather predictable fallingout at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle will and julie hit it off and along friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off radio stationgiveaway vacation in the tropics unfortunately things are not so peachy once they arrive and regularity you could set your watch the infamous fisherman muse watson is back his hook it is another bloody showdown complete cliffhanger ending there is not much that is original about still know and the market saturated genx thrillers like this one it is unlikely that still know will get any recognition other than that of bad sequel for diehard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original know what you did last summer the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot is not heightened skillful scripting or camera work but rather tense stringbased score and manipulative editing the man the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being scary figure nutcase in few short and painful moments much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point the whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order win the trip from the radio station is dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating hurryupandwait timing problem and whereas the killers identity might have been question in the first movie it is almost given here changes the dynamic of the movie drastically three or four teens run automatically from man in rain slicker they nonchalantly refer as the killer they are almost used it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give decent show and so in the end it is left wide open for third movie and most likely brand new supporting cast god help us,0.0
i am dedicated fan of writer kevin williamsons work he always finds clever way spice up old material witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope what used be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here the components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate but where are the thrills the laughs both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge and what shame that is loved the scream films heck even enjoyed the scifi goofiness of the faculty kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such big draw at the box office teaching mrs tingle black comedy that will leave gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end his reign or perhaps it will encourage him spend more time perfecting script than worry about his directing duties still have my faith but fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be forgotten echo of the past the title character of his pet project is vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously overthetop british actress helen mirren mrs tingle is basically every students worst nightmare heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks even the most hardworking of her pupils the principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way mirrens performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like flat soft drink in other words it is poor substitute for williamsons best work the plot is big problem here material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous poor handling on the part of the director the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an overachiever hoping get college scholarship but typical mrs tingle says her history project she worked on for countless hours is laughable later on while studying in the gymnasium classmate barry watson offers her photocopied duplicate of mrs tingles final exam leigh anns best friend marisa coughlan encourages her use it alas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares talk the principal in the morning in the morning how convenient the three students head mrs tingles house attempting set the facts straight and clear leigh anns name things get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in tussle the plan is tie her bed and try get some reasoning out of her of course not everything goes entirely plan besides pointless subplots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little way of actual progress there is no urgency the situation little tension or laughs are involved the humor is completely inconsistent after many of the jokes the theater was so silent could have heard fly sneeze you continue await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace moment like that never arises williamson also does handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor and the beautiful vivica fox has one lifeless scene as caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely on the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable the latter giving frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as substitute teacher while everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable there are few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered the inane script mirren is easily the best reason keep watching she is convincingly evil and fun watch but even her gifted delivery cannot save individual scenes that flounder in boredom if there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be disappointing basically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good we will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real,0.0
a that means well but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental be compelling as drama it is jeroen krabb melodrama about community of jews in antwerp in who cannot forget their bitter past the heroine is an attractive carefree nonreligious yearold chaja fraser who wants forget her jewish roots getting involved in student demonstrations screwing student rebel leader and living her gentile friends away from her nagging mother gebrecht and her selfabsorbed eccentric father schell her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps and her home life is filled angst her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled mementos family album silverware and his old violin he buried them in garden during the war while fleeing the nazis but cannot locate them now due all the changes in the city out of frustration after quitting her job as dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment she reluctantly accepts job as nanny an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building mr apfelschnitt topol tells her about the hasidics are ultraorthodox they do not go the cinema or watch tv adhere strict dress codes and strictly observe their religious laws chaja is at first put off the way they expect her follow their rules but soon finds the wife mrs kalman rossellini be kind and she becomes attached one of her children yearold named simcha monty who does not talk the stern mr kalman krabb is not friendly her and considers her be whore because of the way she dresses hammer home the point of how antisemitism has not gone away there is barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes sneering concierge bradley who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries make things inconvenient for them preventing the jewish family from using the elevator the is done in its hamfisted script as the story adapted from carl friedmans book the shovel and the loom goes from one false note another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality it starts off telling chajas story of how she is lost jewess trying find her identity then her nanny role as she loves mute child stuck in an insulated environment and then it makes it story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cannot be forgotten the effort seemed heavyhanded as the kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles cartoonish flavoring chajas parents are given no human shades while the janitor villain was particularly annoying role that was onedimensional and falsely acted the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as think that she could forget her roots while rossellini gave warm performance of woman suffering in silence but is strong in accepting her faith topols reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things fraser acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings common sense the brazenly uses little simcha get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cannot love it starts out showing how under chajas loving care he is taken the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away beginning saying quack quack and then going on ask the four questions during passover seder but showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence refuses speak because of his stern dad and eventually becomes the victim of tragic accident the thereby exploits the boys sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done felt did not just see movie but attended lecture for the whole minutes of this serious but unappetizing story it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon as it seemed be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarilythe message it keeps sending was already received in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage one has the impression that no one in the learned anything about themselves or the past that seems strange since thought that was what this was supposed be about unless was mistaken and the films real aim was make us cry over simcha,0.0
the tagline for this is some houses are just born bad so did not expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs fireplace guarded stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it did not have be bad it is based on great book the haunting of hill house shirley jackson adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as director yet it would not be fair say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it is nothing more than special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply does not engage at first you do not know what is going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that is what got believe hichock once said that it is better wait for climax than see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction boast of and those elements alone are not enough make it good casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid,0.0

there have been bad films in recent years mr magoo was far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now woke up early the day died it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie the films acting if that is what you want call it is well mediocre me loaded sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the bit boy was wrong after escaping from mental institution the thief played billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty he turns burglary survive robs loan back kills the loan officer and runs thousands countrywide man hunt is on for him catch him and bring him down he ends up in cemetery where he puts his money in coffin keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere now he is determined kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading finale that is less that satisfying was based on longlost script ed wood have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point the moves along at rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack is catchy and vibrant except the first song can be offensive some it opens fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that some of the low points are when the thief steals womans purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as dancer and tippi hendren as deaf woman whom the thief kills the music of psycho come on people get some new ideas already what is even worse is that the has no plot at all well certain extent it does but who cares the time the middle of the arrives we are bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting happen woke up early the day died is perfectly bad it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate make movie even the huge cast talent the is waste of my time and certainly waste of yours,0.0
it would be hard choose the best american political thriller some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may both those films were tense exercises in chills the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed the same man john frankenheimer but that was and respectively for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed each of those films had memorable characters and tense plot they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay the thrills all came from the plot ronin is like made another man somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it we get clue here and one there as what is going on but d zeiks screenplay is bit obscure the begins explaining that ronin is masterless samurai when samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes ronin much like gunfighter in the american west if you miss the opening do not worry this will explain again what ronin is sam played robert de niro is the modern equivalent of ronin he is free agent who seems have really good instincts about how stay alive the world of professional killer he clearly was in dangerous business at one time and now he seems be drifting around on his own somewhere in france sam is recruited from montmartre bar dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman be part of an action steal mysterious metal case dierdre is very tightlipped about what is in the case sam joins team of four others vincent jean reno of the professionalleon and mission impossible spence sean bean tvs richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting also along is larry skipp suddeth the group seems know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional his own field of expertise their only human side seems be in tensions among the members of the team the story is not very easy follow it is never clear who is doublecrossing whom and who is working for whom somehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying get their hands on certain metal case some very good actors are involved in this one wonders what they saw in the script the characters are mostly onedimensional professional killers they know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest the but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up another killer so that neither is killed the end of the we never really got know anybody maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters create in addition the above characters the also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal as revival of sort of action that was popular in the i was hoping that there would be something here grab onto and enjoy unfortunately there are no deep characters and little make us care who eventually ends up the metal case or why they want it rate ronin on the scale and on the scale nonspoiler incidentally the tale of the ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the ronin also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of man breaking down door huge mallet this is the first blow of the ronin,0.0
the main problem martin lawrences pet project thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it does not seem do anything except justify the womans actions that is especially the case in lawrences darnell wright he is one of those macho guys women lined up mile long now do not think condone this just because am male my philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough get your hands on beautiful kind girl you should treat her like princess and respect her darnell does not think like this he sleeps these girls once and dumps them and the period in the he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely whitfield who runs successful real estate business is out kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king found myself thinking am supposed feel sorry for this guy after all it is largely darnells fault if he is lining up all these women you would think he would have enough common sense think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does but he does not so you get the sense that he is not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb you especially get this sense that he is dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her would put my pants on in two seconds after that now brandi is psycho bitch but it is hard not agree what she says darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage one final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell begin brandi is classy intelligent woman an mba from harvard who initally resists darnells immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life but all of sudden she says yes but when you listen darnells four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him lawrence can be good when he wants but in order prove it he needs let other people write and direct his movies look at this movie four writers as result it is too long two hours when it could have easily worked at ninety minutes and it has lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came makes me think the writers did not get along all of is not necessary there are some bright spots though whitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can lazily written parts and they help it out lot and there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but they are just not enough sustain the,0.0
capsule lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for terminal illness potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that was waiting for someone sneeze just break the ice it is perfect example of what my wife calls an f movie where f means so ing earnest movies like this need wit and brashness be absorbing claire is one strained speech after another written delivered all of the energy and spontenaity of dmv clerk claire takes two women claire and noel both writers and throws them together in the same cabin at womenonly writers retreat claire wrights light comedy while noel is scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior obviously the two of them are going have plenty talk about and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie that is all they do talk the movie sets up its microscopic plot beatadeadhorseintoglue obviousness the evening talks at the camp are chaired motherly type named maggie selfprofessed lesbian and when noel owns up also being lesbian claire looks like she is been hit sockful of wet sand the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire significance and claire looks out over the water reflectively ugh the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads all of this of course leads up scene of complete inevitability claire and noel in scene that should have come an hour earlier because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what is just happened we never get hint about how any of this has changed anyone only how they felt about things that did not even happen yet the problem claire is not lesbianism as such but the leaden way it is handled why is it that any serious better word would be adult or at least thoughtful examination of sex in movie almost always winds up producing movie that is unwatchably boring the way this movie deals lesbianism we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are thousand times better more engaging more creative more intellectually and artistically interesting look at john sayles lianna or the interesting and littleseen desert bloom both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire what this movie needed was good swift kick in the pants,0.0
the great actor james woods once said and am paraphrasing if sex is not messy then you are not doing it right truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex your mad slasher for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or subgenre is melding of horror and exploitation elements put the service of plot that follows an identical outline usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens la halloween urban legend is mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special for makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in stale frightfree horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you cannot scare your audience gross em out if you cannot do that make em laugh alas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not intention actually find the fact that this became minor success million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down such degree that any movie even claiming be scary is given the benefit of the doubt the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone three digit iq argue that it provides them unfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences the point where films do not need do anything more than promise good time without the added pressure of delivering if anyone disagrees would love for them explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla but forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation offshoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced allow me present you the real fault of the mad slasher the lack of enthusiastic exploitation these flicks are not harnessed any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience bloody good time sadly out of the literally hundreds made would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on college campus is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer you see the campus is community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface all those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected all the better for that elusive crazed killer coupled the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of little exploitation into the proceedings should be relatively easy task but alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full it is way too clean slasher flick for the whole family no nudity little gore and much stupidity this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than dunno exercise it is the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses runninglikethewindprey yet still manages catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques it is the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loudnoisejumpscare thing yes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but would not anyone if loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when caught glimpse of the killer apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways disguise their mad slashers in scream it was ghost mask scary enough in know what you did last summer it was fisher mans rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka fury hood ooh scary intended conceal hisher identity for urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume though must admit urban legend does have winning premise for what could have been somewhat entertaining exploitation the films killer slices and dices comely college students the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only find that they are coming from inside the house will not spoil the surprise as what urban legends are used after all the does offer fine am cable viewing if you happen be intoxicated enough sad say it does not include my favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and very unhappy gerbil now that would be scary before leave you would like bring your attention the third most irritating thing about the the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people have ever spent an evening only jared leto looking like carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness the most annoying of the bunch is tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as supremely irritating lout so irritating actually cheered his painful death and am not cruel person ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the if viewed as vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining after all this is movie that features the kind of faux hipsters cannot stand getting slaughtered is at least better than watching an entire about people cannot stand not getting slaughtered,0.0
the premise of turbulence is am sure very familiar us all we have seen it before in passenger executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way you know terrorists take over plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on turbulence starts out convict ray liotta being accused of crime you think there is no way he could have done it he is so open and kind he is taken in and is subsequently transported on commerical plane la this is already problem there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on anyway it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting get la and spend christmas eve there well convict one manages stop the flight in its proverbial tracks and liotta still as calm as ever takes the other convict out he also has eyes for lauren holly flight attendent and seems grow closer her the plot stops here did not like this movie because it seemed be rip off of every other airplane movie have ever seen at one point mr liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining am serious it was like they stole for every other movie down t the only reason did not give this stars is because it had some okay stunts do not even bother,0.0
a movie laced good blend of action comedy and heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating dismal and unsatisfactory product eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm dan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his cowriting credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on selfproclaimed mission from god along his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago as we begin elwood is being released from state penitentiary along the news of his brothers death in prison years ago completely on his own elwood decides trace his roots back the orphanage where he spent his childhood only discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away but elwood is not completely without family it seems he has halfbrother of sorts not real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudofather curtis cab calloway from the first who has also passed on despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort start up an all new blues brothers band working as police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mothers affair years ago and then goes on steal his wallet following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster evan bonifant who quickly learns become minielwood when bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace more than just solid blues rock meanwhile cabs personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his nexttonextofkin from this point the movie turns into series of music videos few bits of acting in between those hoping for an interesting andor funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of story only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours for those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the is heavily bogged down unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless year old buster attempting add some sort of home alone cuteness the whole thing appearances musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and whole slew of others are the high points of the but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors blues brothers is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie many many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you do not have passion for very deep bluesrock you will be bored out of your skull much of this seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having this none of the excitement is passed on the audience and seeing three guys in threepiece suits goofily dancing around poker faces can only be funny for so long unfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the,0.0
if only austin powers the spy who shagged me had been just half as original zany silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor it would have easily been one of this summers biggest pleasures if only in fact the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original instead of refreshing the audience one clever parody after another the filmmakers bombard us usedup tired jokes taken directly from the first one take the scene where austin powers again played mike myers but only fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously confronts henchmen on the side of cliff after being pushed off the ravine the bad guy is of course assumed dead but suddenly we hear pleading voice coming from down below he is only injured similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery but here was insulted it did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at ripoff apparently overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer considering that the has pulled in over million in domestic theatrical grosses alone do hear the sound of franchise heading our way having said that though still cannot deny the its merits the basic plot was delightfully silly enough sustain my interest somewhat dr evil mike myers in the second of his three roles having constructed time machine goes back the year in an attempt snatch austin powers mojo do not you just love that word whilst he is cryogenically frozen when austin gets wind of this after great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington he too travels back in time reclaim his sexual drive accompanied the hottotrot felicity shagwell played heather graham this sounds stupid know but in the movie it starts make some kind of weird offthewall sense and it worked for me then there is minime verne troyer petite clone of myers dr evil exactly in size troyers persona alone gains the an extra halfstar contributing one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts nibble on his own minimr bigglesworth just try ignore the fact that at he would make dr evils height rise just over feet no matter however there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and half the most notable being the now infamous tent scene and that just is not enough warrant even minor recommendation if there is in fact an austin powers they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr evil and minime unconventional yes but there is no denying that it would make for better movie,0.0

alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most oftenadapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is legend rather than just story perhaps the musketeer new that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many it is just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into mishmash of oldastime clich and incoherent repetitive action sequences this time dartagnan is played calvin klein model justin chambers who cannot even pronounce his characters name as boy he watched his father get killed febre tim roth lackey of powerhungry cardinal richelieu he vowed have vengeance after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy on his quest he embroils himself in struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government the royal musketeers have lost their gusto what their jobs being taken over the cardinals own guards only few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie together dartagnan they fight extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying plant oh and as an afterthought dartagnan falls in love the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari just thought would mention that now look do not know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves severe tonguelashing have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects director peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie instead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead nothing when the musketeers finally get holler all for one and one for all could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that felt maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyamss tone is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the readers digest condensed version of the story that he gives us it is as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production the joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame chambers cannot act suvari roth and deneuve can but are not given the chance and when push comes shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets play villain without having wear an ape suit some movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for quick buck the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted be awful the is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time,0.0

when first saw the preview for cruel intentions turned my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids it was clear me that the would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is stephen frears masterpiece imagine my surprise see that writerdirector roger kumble has given credit his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits and was impressed in fact was much more impressed this recognition than the actual is an appalling excuse for movie it is kiddieporn hackwork complete earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs suppose this kind of movie was inevitable all the teen highschool angst movies coming out there was certainly room for pretentious and laughable movie about bunch of teenagers who think they are smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined cruel intentions is mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way expected it hated all the characters and hate everything they do also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be phillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont wow is not that memorable name could just say it over and over again sebastian valmont it kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he cannot have no material object out of his reach he has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips and luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults do not really exist the ones who do are irritating sebastian valmont lives his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitchqueen of the universe and also the woman every man wants since these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other meaningless sexual liaisons kathryn wants sebastian valmont devirginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn but it is too easy for sebastian valmont he wants nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty so sebastian valmont and kathryn make deal is too explicit state here but dear god sebastian valmont actually begins fall for poor annette hargrove dangerous liaisons is great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting cruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting kathryn merteuil is simply hateful witch girl so loathsome that would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her she is supposed be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons gellar while aesthetically pleasing is onedimensional and utterly repulsive witherspoon has truly beautiful face but her character is not the moral staple she is supposed be sure she will not have sex until she is in love is this really moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than little reprehensible but cannot forget mr phillippe who continues exceed my expectations his impenetrable invulnerable blandness have give him credit and say that he did in fact manage change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions and there is one point in the in he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone true he is bad but it does not help that he has no character work kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed be sympathetic because he falls in love moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch the fails in every other way too first of all nobody talks like this even the intellectuals know do not bother this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering for while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there is no way we can join it cruel intentions also manages come off as softporn in more than one scene earlier mentioned fullyclothed handjob this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended be hateful at this point in the movie so if we hate them then what is the point of an extended sex scene titillation of course it cannot even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters it is interesting note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons kumble is clearly familiar the earlier many of the scenes have similar tone and there are moments in frears that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers but kids do not act like this nobody acts like this in his translation roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy some pretty crucial elements the result is picture of confounding badness kiddieporn mess that thinks it is really deep and profound will give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences but that does not change the fact that it is awful,0.0
everyone knows that old rule never work children and animals in this latest horror flick mimic case it is never work children and genetically enhanced killer animals instead as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience the begins in new york where we see children dying from mysterious disease is being carried cockroaches dr susan tyler sorvino creates genetically enhanced bug the judas breed however is designed kill all cockroaches the bug does it is job the cockroaches all die and the terror is gone three years later appears on the screen and we discover that the judas breed is back bigger than ever and ready kill the spin on this bug however is that it can mimic it is predator and in this case it is humans that should teach us for squishing all those bugs what should be roller coaster ride bugs everywhere tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out be rather subdued almost boring movie plods along at very slow pace perhaps the movie was trying be thought provoking and trying avoid the predator type movie it could easily have become if it is then the director and writers have made the wrong move because this is perfectly suited be an all out action fest the director who bought us cronos far superior directs the in calm and frankly dull movie there are few exciting sequences instead just lot of people talking if the dialogue was intelligent then it would be all right but it is sadly babbling nonsense in fact the script is embarrsingly weak and the characterizations not much better sorvino and company are as as characters come the script not bothering develop them there is some action in this but it is directed in such an annoying way it is just infuriating watch the camera cuts all over the place disoreitating the audience and instead of involving the audience in the action it merely alienates them the peformances are k if slightly below average sorvino is k although she is not very good at conveying terror or anything emotion really the supporting cast are all sterotypes characters such as big black security guard foul mouth geeky scientist spectacles and what could be the most stereotypical mexican old timer ever their reasonable good fun however mimic then may fail it is story pacing and characters but the does look good like dark city mimic is definite case of style of content it may be bit too gloomy for it is own good but the sets look nice and parts of the are directed well but looks are not good enough save mimic from the depths of mediocre somewhere where it should not really belong good opportunity then wasted shame overall rating review david wilcock,0.0
this movie tries present itself as the sequel jan de bonts debut as director surprise hit speed but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead annie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again she is going on cruise her new boyfriend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped john geiger willem dafoe who has bone pick the shipping line they sacked him after he got sick now he wants the diamonds stored in the ships safe for compensation that actually is the whole storyline speed could do without dialogues the movie is all about images and remarkable sound do not really know why this is called an action movie except for few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the ies first we are introduced number of people who are going be important later on in the movie then desaster strikes sandra bullock was said have been glad that she could take action this time around looked for the action but could not find it most of the time she is part of the decoration the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have shot at defusing bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind fire door now we know that she can handle chain saw we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds the bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water his initial seasickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers be saved from evil geiger he does pretty good job but cannot blame keanu reeves for declining this part then there is willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries look as frightening as frankensteins monster he does not succeed though an untidy appearance is not enough convince the viewer of his psychopath potential before he tries again make us believe he is dangerous man he should practise for while in front of mirror cannot really recommend speed you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that are not meant be funny especially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles whole village is treat there you get see the most superfluous scene in the movie in keeping last years desaster movie tradition dog is miraculously saved from certain death really funny and meant be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie had they looked out the window they would not have missed the huge ship racing toward them those of you who still want see the movie should pick theater large screen and good sound system enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects in an adequately equipped theater it is as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate but the ilm special effects cannot save the movie for all the money they could have done better,0.0

steven spielbergs amistad is based on the true story of group of africans who revolted on board slave ship then were captured and taken america where legal dispute ensued over who owned them is concerned several different aspects of this story first the addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery second it deals the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins last and most importantly it examines the cultural confusion experienced the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done their native culture in africa the slave trade amistad succeeds at least partly all three of these elements have admit that was little skeptical as how much could really get out of another antislavery movie having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery doubted that there was much did not already know about it fortunately turned out be wrong for one thing spielbergs camera never once gets near southern plantation and instead sticks the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa so amistad was dealing different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning and some of the images here are in fact much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery one scene in the middle in the crew of slave ship dispose of some of their excess slaves throwing them overboard drown has be one of the most disturbing images of the year spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than was expecting he would and in fact he probably goes about as far as movie director can without getting an nc rating the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply the shallow luxury of the politicians such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only small child at the time exposing politicians as narrowminded opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff of course but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just simple exercise in audience manipulation the also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved of the practice was reluctant get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way the supreme court the biggest success of amistad is probably the characterization of cinque djimon hounsou who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles communicate baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them in court through cinque we are given window into the native culture as he and the displaced africans try explain the prison guards what they need for proper burial of dead tribe member or find an illustrated version of the bible and try understand the story of jesus christ cinque sees the dispute clarity and simplicity that again contrasts the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles what kind of country is this where laws almost work he asks baldwin in bewilderment when he learns that the case must be retried before the supreme court spielbergs direction tends little bit towards the manipulative side at times such as when he adds heavy orchestral swell cinques angry outburst in the court room still there is not enough of this for it be serious problem the main flaw in this prevents it from earning four stars is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni cannot quite handle all of these issues at the same time so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie this summers contact for example dealt several issues at once but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and most importantly all of them were resolved at once amistad tries pull it all together in the end speech from adams but it somehow feels little forced and in any case the speech itself lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through perhaps the best way describe it is this amistad is three four star films edited into one almost every individual scene works but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus is less than the sum of its parts however cannot honestly say how it could have been done differently and in any case the story comes through enough raw emotional power that it is still very good and thus recommend it anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery,1.0

you have got love disney no matter what they serve up it is guaranteed success as long as it is animated kids have go see the movie then they have get the toys oh the video came out got buy it or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of pilgrimage mecca visit the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy disney tshirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on stick it is both vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good what is most amazing is that all this success is in spite of severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes each new movie the plot does not the plot is mold into the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined do no more than the same however while the success of disney animated feature is generally given as far as boxoffice receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that has offer luckily disneys latest animated offering mulan manages be engaging and refreshing even while rife formula the starts the invasion of ancient china the huns led the imposing shanyu miguel ferrer soon chinas emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve fight in chinas defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soontek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan mingna wen disguises herself as man and sneaks off the royal orders join the chinese army mulan based on chinese epic poem is classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is disgrace her loving family as she has difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role and in very amusing scene where matchmaker attempts assess her value potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented the high importance of bringing honor ones family and botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task leaving home fight in her fathers place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the am not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salongas voice translates much better animation you have hear it understand interestingly the musical numbers are so often done big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number is customary as the second or third song in disney but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation has been built disneys own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up the vibrance so associated many of the other disney works it helps contribute more authentic and therefore more credible nature what otherwise may be seen as typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shanyus hun army utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves take her fathers place she dons her fathers old battle armor and unsheathes sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the varying from the straight such as soontek oh as fa zhou the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao gruff pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent look after mulan although an obvious attempt relive the chemistry brought forth robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself his own winning performance found the choice of d wong as shang little strange you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so guess anythings possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character provides significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings the movie but also because she is voiced two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice is venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fas singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature get away from some of the eurocentrism for so long dominated disney films in an effort be culturally sensitive and avoid miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei guess clyde kusatsu was not available at running time of slightly under an hour and half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better,1.0

the success of the surprise hit alien directed ridley scott sequel was inevitable in fact after watching the first sequel was wanted particularly this reviewer handing over the directors chair recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous this one pirahna ii surprisingly dull and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got facelift of immense proportions instead of being suspensescience fiction cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created like aliens comes along only once in while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it never saw this movie in theaters but wish could have the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely audiences members literally shrieking in fear aliens is an action unlike any have ever seen science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original in fact aliens is one of those few sequels tops the original perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine as the case may be never have we had more sympathetic hero in an action and never have seen such an impressive acting job done the main character sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us care about placing woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weavers presence woman is the only suitable hero aliens begins years after alien ended lieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter the aliens but the company is doubtful they explain that colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from she just left despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and will not call the families back however when the company loses contact the colony ripleys story seems much more feasible one of the companys directors carter burke paul reiser wants gather team travel the planet this team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen burke tags along ripley as they fly the planet in order locate the members of the colony arriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in cocoontype environment the only survivor is year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn ripley finds this chance be the mother she never had the opportunity become and she becomes newts surrogate mother ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general alien focused on one alien in particular systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed jettison the alien out of the nostromo aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as result the chills are incredibly heightened then again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator judgment day he is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this it seems that every alien seems have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action aliens climax never seems hit until the viewer is nearly pushed extreme exhaustion cannot recall another ever sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for moment just when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends one of the greatest moments in history this scene is usually the one remembered most from the as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines fight the alien queen using flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety of course for of this genre work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us believe what we see aliens is completely realistic even decade after its initial release the special effects are wonderfully seamless terrifying alien go them one of the most overlooked aspects of this is the music composed cameronregular james horner horner has created terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work not only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action or science fiction ever and that includes space odyssey was mainly compilation of wellknown composers in fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of music the production design is incredible also happened snag nomination from the academy dark corridors lit red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror arises from welllit locations normally will be very dark in order scare viewer aliens uses lights scare the viewer then of course is the cinematography uses point of view shots along video feeds in order build suspense some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley surprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona weaver soars above the rest in this but she is supposed carrie henn gives an above average performance for child developing threedimensional character from her quiet attitude lance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids do not always have be flat characters jenette goldstein shows fair amount of enthusiasm her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she is not fighting michael biehn gives very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the however biehn does good job making it seem original again paul reiser may seem like an odd choice play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages pull it off quite well however still see him as paul on tvs mad about you very good cast also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action making it stand out from others aliens is rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of suspensehorror aliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it professional quality cameron certainly knows how make good action but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen technically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there get killed aside from this you probably will not experience anything like aliens for quite while,1.0

capsule suprisingly more of comedy than straight action flick is not necessarily bad thing not exactly oscar caliber but one helluva bulletriddled good time extended review you know remember when hitmen were evil murderous scum alas the times are achangin in recent string of movies hitmen are suddenly wise cracking funloving killerswithhearts this brings us hong kong director kirk wongs first american feature the big hit oddly enough about the same time last year similar grosse point blank was released advertised as quirky comedy hints of action it turned out have suprising dosage of it the big hit is quite the opposite it was hyped as the new from producer john woo so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action however there is sore lack of it is about the only thing wrong the big hit the starts out mel smiley and his cohorts doing job on white slaver mel played mark wahlberg in dopey milquetoast role is killing machine he flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps sadly he does not get chance do much of it except for the beginning set piece and the last twenty minutes or so the is in comedy mode the action at least what there is of it is prime cut stuff wong after numerous hong kong features makes quite nice s debut however his pacing is bit off the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough they start off electrifying and fresh but just kinda stop normally this would hamper movie the point of being unenjoyable luckily we have ben ramseys screenplay bitingly funny piece of work the only problem is there might be too much humor one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few some of best gags include an oriental maker down on his luck and one of mels hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled some being there only for laugh sometimes works sometimes does not overall the big hit may have it is flaws but it makes up for them in stylishly directed gutwrenchingly funny joyride definately one of the better ways spend two hours,1.0

when you go the movies as much as do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times such was the case frequency every time went screening there was the frequency preview it looked awful it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous it looked like flop well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far frequency boasts compelling story line an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel speak his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for years john is able give his father information that prevents his death in warehouse fire but doing so causes other changes somehow serial killers reign of terror in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends ten victims including johns mother this is director gregory hoblit is third the other two being primal fear and fallen all three he is managed attach himself great scripts this one toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction also he apparently likes have his films wrap up kickass ending frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying hoblit is three for three and hope he can keep it up now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want the scifi elements of frequency but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved who is say how something works and how it does not when it is never happened is it because we have become accustomed time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back the future trilogy and quantum leap yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this probably will not make any sense most films are like that do not let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining however when frequency was over it made me wish had seen it my father so could have given him hug okay okay shut up when you break it down past all its scifi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply movie about father and his son and the bond that they share it is touching it is sincere and it is what ultimately makes this movie work pg,1.0

i had chance see sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night went in the expectation of the similar flavor made the original such success personal growth and insightful humor about life came away somewhat disappointed in this regard getting some of the latter and not much of the former the basic plot revolves around billy crystal who plays mitch robbins turning forty he is now become the station manager of the radio station in he worked in the original he is given job at the radio station his best friend played daniel stern out of sympathy while sterns character works through his divorce his loser younger brother john lovitz comes mitchs house bum money and place live all while mitch and his wife try celebrate his birthday during the celebration mitch discovers what appears be treasure map in curlys the cattle drive leader in the original played jack palance old hat after business trip las vegas crystal stern and lovitz stay few extra days go off in search of the treasure on the way they run into curlys twin brother duke played you know who jack palance first of all the cinematography was beautifully done especially the outdoor scenes in the desert the scenes are such that would like see some of those sights filmed myself there is some character development during the the actors remain true their characters and play them well without overplaying the jokes the movie is good basic adventure enough plot twists provide for an ending that is difficult predict the movie is paced well but couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end humorwise the has good number of jokes maintained my interest throughout the there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten snake but there are fewer jokes laugh at in the sequel surprise surprise for sequel right however the slight bitter aftertaste have this has do mainly the films manipulation of the audience the tries pull your heartstrings too much regarding how close the characters are each other like when mitch had decided suck the snake marrow out of his best friends butt this is done again when the gang meets up some members of the cattle drive group from the original there were also some parts appeared unrealistic like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they did not worry more about water while tromping around the desert some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here since the objective of the gang is find gold and get rich unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original also found it harder empathize the characters during their journey overall would say that the is an entertaining and humorous adventure some storyline deficiencies making it less worthy than the original it may be worth the full price of admission but matinee would be better bargain,1.0
the submarine genre of movies seems be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is think about it these films are completely based in reality yet only handful of people have ever been on one making them fascinating the general public they are not like movies that take place on plane or train as anybody can get on one of those and they are not like movies that happen in outer space either because no ones done any of that stuff yet when new one comes out you do not hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend say ugh another boxing movie look at modern movies that involve submarines das boot the abyss the hunt for red october crimson tide all are well regarded as topnotch entertainment gladly joining that bunch is stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of u naval submarine during world war ii we learn he has been denied recommendation for his own command his superior bill paxton mcconaugheys crew then receives orders that they will be boarding disabled german submarine steal the enigma german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence the mission goes horribly wrong however and as result mcconaughey and only handful of his crew as well as captured german become trapped aboard the in enemy waters the first great thing about is the films opening sequence the german crew of are under attack sets the events of the rest of the into motion it is tense exciting and fascinating and applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german english subtitles most movies scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away once the plot gets moving gives us action sequence after action sequence making the audience wonder ok now how do they get out of this the stakes keep raising much like in executive decision an excellent actionthriller and even though the audience knows how the will end it is lot of fun getting there only have two minor complaints about the entire the first comes from the scenes follow the opening sequence while their purpose is introduce us the characters and get the story going they do feel as though it could have been done much quicker and less conventionally mean did we really have see the ships crew at wedding because of that you now know exactly what is going happen the groom my other gripe would be during the films finale there is an explosion ends the that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the presidents plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one cannot stress this enough until cgi effect can be made look like model effect stick using models yes is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard submarine will tell you that could not happen but the overall point of this is entertainment it succeeds fantastically pg,1.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low oh he is been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another featurelength it is been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak pulp fiction reached has made mr tarantinos new feature jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker emerge from the things are not going well for jackie brown pam grier she is years old stuck at deadend job year plus retirement benefits that are not worth damn as flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and she is just been caught at the airport atf agent ray nicolette portrayed terrific childlike enthusiasm michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie samuel jackson who has her bailed out unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster the loquacious ordell based out of hermosa beach house where his horny bonghitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is dead rat and he is soon out silence jackie brown meanwhile the authorities target is ordell and they want jackie help them arranging sting the tune of halfmillion dollars only through series of clever twists turns and doublecrosses will jackie be able gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses although jackie brown marks mr tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch there is no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this while he is adhered closely the source material in narrative sense the setting has been relocated los angeles and the lead characters now black in terms of ambiance the harkens back the from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage productions the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era the timeframe for the is in fact but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro of course nothing in the screams more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss it is perhaps the most tender scene of the year tenderness in quentin tarantino sure thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantinos films are typified manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but what is new here is different facet of his storytelling willingness imbue the poignant emotional undercurrent and patience draw out several scenes great deliberation this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply helmer of slick hip crime dramas fasttalking lowlifes and heralds him as bonafide multifaceted talent he is the real deal this new aspect of mr tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in single character that of the worldweary sensitive and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry whose unspoken attraction jackie is touching mr forsters nuanced understated performance is the best in the he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along him much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did bolster john travoltas thensagging career as it turns out ms grier is solid in the films title role although nothing here forces her test her range do have take exception the claim that this marks her career resurrection though she is been working steadily over the years often in directtovideo action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks and larry cohens original gangstas where she first teamed up mr forster of course it is true that her role here was godsend meaty part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better and while the films narrative does not really warrant running time of minutes it is filled such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there was not an unengaging moment an impressive trio of feature films under his belt it will be interesting see what he tries next,1.0

the happy bastards second review big daddy happy gilmore as father of course that is the latest scenario presented adam sandler in the new movie big daddy movie that is passable but is not really considered some of sandlers best work he does not actually play happy gilmore in the movie but variation of him he is sonny coufax man who is living off settlement he got for cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as tollbooth man tollbooth willie his girlfriend kristy swanson is fed up his lifestyle and demands change before she leaves him enter year old kid who is mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate jon stewart who is off in china on business trip from there coufax basically acts as the kids father teaching him different things like peeing on the side of building and tripping up skateboarders sticks he even manages use the kid in sort of con game get the attention of beautiful law office worker joey lauren adams but somehow he also garners the attention of social services who are not particularly pleased coufaxs actions as he pretends be his roommate keep the kid the reason say it is not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of movie showing some odd feelings that somehow did not really belong in sandler vehicle mean it fits the movies tone and everything and sandler handles it well but it is just oddly placed that is all fortunately it does not destroy the goofy glee path it is been following and it still makes you feel good sandler does good job here as he does in most of his movies rob schneider however is irritating as his friend an immigrant delivery boy who cannot read stewart in his minor time on screen is great and adams remains joy watch look for steve buscemi as well as homeless bum he is hoot directed dennis dugan director of happy gilmore the movie remains good couple of hours pass the time again there are faults but hey everyone needs get emotional sometimes,1.0
six days seven nights is summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered some pretty uneven fare heres genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it is fluff recognizes it is fluff and is admittedly proud be fluff of course the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays sizeable part in the movies success ford is such concentrated dramatic actor that it is easy forget what funny guy he can be as his female counterpart anne heche also deserves big pat on the back for her sweet goofily charismatic performance the age difference fords heche is matters not these two click in charged way that is hard come the story is nobrainer ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris while heche is careerminded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe robin on tropical vacation fianc frank david schwimmer gets assigned supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti so she reluctantly hires quinn fly her there the plane crashes during terrible storm and they immediately find themselves stuck in deserted paradise few ideas on getting back civilization series of unpleasant often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple fall for each other meanwhile back at the resort frank is tempted himself quinns shapely female tagalong jacqueline obradors that subplot obviously exists get us rooting for the quinnrobin pairing and while it makes for few good laughs early on it eventually becomes contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin and since the spends most of its time the castaways this flaw is only minor inconvenience director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk at slim minutes six days seven nights never wears out its welcome where lesser could have felt like it was as long as its title michael brownings clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable oneliners my favorite taken in context is you mean _arrrgh_ pirates and though it essentially boils down one mishap after another they are all quite engaging even the movies more serious moments are played wink heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life ellen degeneres would affect the believability of six days seven nights heterosexual pairing so she is lesbian so what deal it of course it does not and here her naysayers are proved wrong in big way in fact her chemistry ford is what really makes the click these opposites attract the utmost endearing electricity at one point when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest heche asks ford how old he is after several wrong guesses fortyfive _fifty_ he whispers his age her you still look good heche stammers still _am_ good ford replies she is good too and together they make six days seven nights one memorable ride,1.0
the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of adaptations of stephen kings work this slowmoving character study provides some outstanding acting performances the principals but suffers from tepid conclusion inconsistent direction and may not have wide commercial appeal when the maid dolores claiborne is found brandishing rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer it seems like an openandshut murder case upon hearing of the death via mysterious fax dolores estranged and bitter daughter esquire magazine writer selena st george returns from new york back her tiny island village childhood home as the two clash horns the story behind the mysterious death of dolores abusive husband two decades ago ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey is revealed did dolores kill her husband and did she kill her employer dolores claiborne is certainly more of character study than suspense thriller consequently it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywoods finest character actors such as bates leigh and strathairn kathy bates plays the films title character and gives sensational lead performance dolores claiborne is essentially showcase for the talent of bates as her character has huge amount of screen time she dominates the screen producing character that is compelling and arresting as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks kathy bates performance is awardcalibre stuff the rest of the cast is also very good jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour bitter helena st george well and christopher plummer seems be enjoying himself as dolores everpresent nemesis the determined detective john mackey david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores husband joe st george judy parfitt is fine as dolores tyrannic socialite employer vera donovanit would have been interesting see say meg foster in this role child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences she is very impressive the direction of dolores claiborne taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the ranging from some parts are quite clever in their own right parts are embarrassingly hokey the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hitandmiss in terms of effectiveness the pacing of the tends be numbingly slow tends undermine any suspense might be built up however the cinematography gabriel beristain is wonderfuli particularly like the chilling iceblue hue permeating the presentday scenes contrasting well the many nova scotia ocean shotsand danny elfman provides surprisingly understated score for the it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited none of the performers in the could be classified as big draw and its pacing may be turnoff those expecting gripping suspense filled twists and turns and car crashes and axewielding psychopaths although being essentially the only in its genre in release now it may also be hurt the negative perception of king works even the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand dolores claiborne suffers from very unsatisfying conclusion and moves very slowly however the performances are uniformly excellent particularly kathy bates and the has its moments on my fourstar scale give dolores claiborne three stars,1.0
seen september at m at rotterdam square mall cinema theater chris wessell for free using my sonyloews critics pass theater rating good seats average sound picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents do not want their kids see it is not that it is drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it is that flatout says you can make career out of gambling and take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life this starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing matt damon stars as mike mcdermott something law student in presentday new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played damon narrates throughout the but the entire opening scene is voicedover so perfectly completely and totally define the setting mikes about go up against teddy kgb malkovich russian gangster who looks like serial killer but then again he practically is one and the does everything convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally damon in the flesh might seem little out of place his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features but his narration is what brings it all together he never sounds like he is reading from script nor that he is trying embellish anything it just comes natural him the screenwriters use the right words and phrases describe the mood from the smell of the air the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite immediately we get the sense that poker is not for gamblers but for near geniuses nerves of steel the game is quiet war strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes the game of poker all respect is due the winner because he is truly the better man the does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble bit we learn only little about mike both past and present presently we know he has girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues over his gambling they go through few breakupmakeup cycles until mikes childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison it is not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars the mob but what is surprising is how the is able take such predictable element and execute it the way it does technically the plot is not unlike many childrens sitcoms in the good kids bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends the bad kid what this does is use different medium tell that story mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share passion for outthinking the other player who is trying do the same them where as worm prefers go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he is dealt and works them sometimes they pay off e his ability pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they do not e the fact he takes himself out of the game and works steady job after dropping on single hand once things start happening the is able expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions taking the tourists at atlantic city outwitting the gangsters that control it all everything they come into contact is big poker game in that everythings battle against the cards destiny deals one scene demonstrates this perfectly in mike is told judge martin landou in perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time matts good at gambling but he is also got potential be great lawyer he could go professional as either but one he could lose everything or win big but the other there is stability but not much risk involved can someone who is gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave if the had been just subtle lesson in pokerplaying then the ending is our test everything is told from mikes perspective but we are finally able recognize some things on our own this makes the final againstall odds showdown seem like just that it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end,1.0
there was lot riding on this movie everyone even moderately interested in the scream series was dying know how it would end what would be the final act this is the end of an era for them movie has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet talking and tossing around rumors their equally enthused buddies and for kids under those elaborate plots consisting of buying ticket one movie and hopping into scream while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only year or two older than themselves no need worry scream is endlessly inventive and entertaining fine epilogue the series that made kevin williamson household name reinvented the horror genre and continued in the selfreferential postmodern tradition of quentin and co so how does the story go as opposed what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe sidney prescott neve campbell now allgrownup and constantly dealing her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche is not living in fulfilling her dream become an actress but rather in upstate california living understandably alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems she works at home as crisis center affiliate over the phone but that not where the movie starts off instead in tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar and conceptually horrifying sequence in eye for an eye cotton weary liev schreiber now big star drives home his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls demands the location of sidney home and when he doesn get it threatens the life of cotton girlfriend christine and cotton can do anything stop him the rest of the sequence is particularly clever setting up constant throughout the picture the killer has hightech electronic voicechanger that tops that of the first two not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voiceover artist roger jackson ha ha he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters including sidney and the returned gale weathers courtney cox arquette and dewey riley david arquette at the same time stab the third filmwithinafilm based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college has taken less authentic approach this time around in return woodsboro whereas the account of the first two films was true the franchise within scream has now become totally fictional nevertheless we learn cotton made an appearance in the movie is now in production as himself be killed off in the first scene so it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in they bite it in the movie either the actor portraying them or the real thing sometimes both clever indeed but who goes next no one knows three different scripts were penned we re told keep the true finale off the internet nod the scream fiasco few years back and no one knows for sure one the killer read still all the while sidney stays concealed in her home only visiting dad for the first halfhour of the while also having horrifying visions of her mother takes us back bit sidney fear of becoming what her mother was or at least what her mother was secretly when sidney finally ventures out as the murders become more prevalent she chased onto the set of stab wandering through woodsboro written and directed as an odd surreal nightmare indeed this is one of scream finest moments okay over the years ll admit that ve become quite the scream fan no don have the ghostface costume or the director cut laserdisc but often find myself compelled pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films yes said dramatic element sometimes debating family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated scream throughout the though noticed much more subtle approach than the other two films granted that there stabbinaplenty going on throughout but there considerably less blood less gore honestly like this approach it more classical more rebellious constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven he knows when hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze energy illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience some critics have noted that scream seems take itself more seriously this time maybe so or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger arlington road who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts saw an opportunity for true irony maybe even little bit of satire if the worked in few more clich what puts damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative m afraid is the ending or rather the identity of the killer it does the job guess accomplishes what it should bringing the three films full circle but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears little too contrived too arbitrary after second viewing endeavored upon due this recurring disapprobation the killer identity still seems little too random but his motivation came across more sound this time around and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying all in all scream does not fall victim the most lamented principle of trilogy it is not the worst of the films as trilogy scream was lot of fun refreshing humorous offbeat almost sad see it go but then it does seem best quit while you re ahead and scream does fine job of providing closure its characters for now scream holds the title as the finest series of horror films be committed celluloid not too shabby,1.0

although many people have compared this new gangster comedy the hit hbo drama the sopranos analyze this is witty and entertaining enough be good movie in it is own right billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol who new patient happens be gangster boss paul vitti de niro ben wants nothing do vitti as he is about get married laura macnamara kudrow and having gangster as patient would not really help but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds and reluctantly helps vitti sort his life out all done in comic fashion of course although never brilliant analyze this is also never rubbish makes for fun ride billy crystal who has not had good role since city slickers way back in the early is given role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act he is pretty funny while he does it and although his character is little close his character in city slickers he is pretty funny robert de niro is hilarious as vitti playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny he is serious gangster unaware that he is comic gold mine lisa kudrow barely seen as crystals estranged wife be basically reprises her phoebe role from v series friends is getting rather tiresome and does not come off well on the screen the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas and are all funny caricatures especially vittis bodyguard jelly joe viterelli the genuinely plays like proper gangster movie but laughs instead of hard ass talking it sometimes gets little bloody for light hearted but it strangely fits in spoofs are made of famous gangster movies including nice parody of the godfather the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute the fun there is also some odd plot points fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason it is true that analyze this has had somewhat chequered production history and perhaps the plot points were expanded in earlier version of the script unfortunately this is so we will never know harold ramis best known as egon from ghostbusters has deft touch directing comedy as shown in the immortal groundhog day and the less immortal caddyshack all the comic potential in scene is dug out and presented the audience the script written ramis along peter tolan and ken lonergan starts off funny remains funny for the most of the but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory the is short however and just before audience interest is waning the suddenly goes into rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll analyze this is good comedy and is certainly worth watching robert de niro sobbing is reason enough watch it even though it does seem forced or like parody although think this was intentional crystal is his most likeable in years kudrow is given as little screen time as possible is good thing and de niro is just awesome it is no goodfellas and it probably will not be remembered as much as groundhog day but analyze this is well done comedy that will not leave you feel cheated,1.0
being john malkovich is the type of we need see more todays films are either blockbusters that entertain us tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes malkovich falls under none of these categories and it is quite refreshing see that occur this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable john cusack plays puppeteer trying make it the big time his wife cameron diaz supports the both of them working at petstore explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment when cusack finally realizes he needs get job he finds an ad for filing clerk when he reaches the building he arrives at floor it is there that he discovers secret portal that leads being john malkovich for minutes at time meanwhile cusack meets business partner catherine keener in he falls madly in love her the only problem is she has no interest in him what so ever the whole portal thing is not just toy in fact it becomes cusacks dream being inside malkovichs mind gave him the opportunity basically control mlakovich like puppet and fulfill his fantasies do not want give away too much but cusack becomes too attached his discovery in my opinion this idea is absolutely brilliant it is really quite scary think that someone could become you control you be you it makes you wonder why we act like we do and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue even if the script is super sharp cannot help but find the ending displeasing it could have lead up something more or at least an amusing conclusion it tried explain mythology about the portals that made it seem rushed other than that had very enjoyable time the acting was quite delightful as well john cusack has finally been given chance prove his ability and he does it well he is far the most underrated actor due lack of popularity but am hoping that will change cameron diaz was her usual charming self although felt that part was wrong for her but she pulled it off john malkovich himself continues creep out people his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice who elses mind would be better explore the director spike jonze who appeared in last months three kings really catches my attention this project knew he was bizzare but not this extreme he too is likely too receive media attention being john malkovich is not an excellent but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become cult favorite what is even better is the films puzzling message am nick lyons,1.0

perhaps it is time for me say little about my reading habits really do like read and have enjoyed many books in my lifetime my problem is that am slow reader and not very dedicated will enjoy portions of book and then set it down for months at time it is taken me the last six weeks get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though am loving the book in addition this typically do not read anything created after the th century the only reason bother this bit of information is because feel bad admitting time after time that have not read any of the books on these films are based the only exception believe is great expectations however do not think it should be necessary read the book beforehand in order judge the quality of the needless say have not read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on steven soderberghs new is based cannot say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up leonards vision can say that it is terrific sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected soderbergh it is certainly nice distraction from lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered out of sight proves that it does not had originally written george clooney off as onenote actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing little flair after seeing his latest performance in this have changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those million superstars here he plays jack foley middle aged guy who robs banks for living he does it because it is fun think but the opens him getting caught because his car will not start he goes jail is interesting only break out five cinematic minutes later the help of his friend buddy ving rhames we are then introduced karen sisco jennifer lopez u marshall who conveniently is waiting shotgun as jack escapes fortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them safety the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible we soon learn that the is not told in sequence and since this is gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise at first kind of felt that it was gimmick but guess it was gimmick in pulp fiction too it is fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material enough humor that everything comes off naturally have only seen few of soderberghs films was impressed both kafka and sex lies and videotape but think he is excellent at what he does he is an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious is always admirable he uses tricks yes lots of freezeframe stuff here but it all adds the smooth and quirky currents in the as said clooney is terrific and he is matched lopez lopez is of course beautiful but she can act too can sense that she is honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome uturn the two actors have arresting chemistry one another the best scene in the far is the seduction scene the brilliance of this scene is also due in part soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in bar the physical act takes place few minutes later the scene is series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing the supporting cast is strong led the alwaysreliable ving rhames dennis farina who plays karens father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain steve zahn who plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and that is in where every scene is already at high level all of the actors are helped the dialogue and the intelligentlyconstructed script scott frank out of sight is certainly light although there are few heavy moments that will linger in the memory overall can recommend it simply as great entertainment not every has change your life and it is nice see movie that uses the art tell great story and simply entertain its viewers as for the book this is good enough make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at,1.0
note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned among my fanatical ticker tapeworshipping friends there is one who happens share the same philosophy espoused the central character in darren aronofskys darkly original pi the entire stock market can be reduced nothing but series of patterns through analysis will produce information accurately forecast future behaviour an example of the mentality involved if the stock price goes up like this and then down like that and then sharply up this way it then will go this way while freely admit that know less than nothing about the market knowledge check prices up good prices down bad most of the time at least and hence really could not comment any authority it is always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system and besides if it were that simple no doubt somebody would have already figured it all out the difference in this case is that while my colleague an otherwise assuredly realistic individual truly believes in this in and of itself as valid forecaster pi uses this ideology as device investigate its characters psychosis it is also vastly more convincing its argument mathematics is the language of the universe insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen sean gullette in cool mantralike voiceover repeats throughout the picture since nature can be expressed in numbers and there are patterns everywhere in nature he reasons eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him predict anything the ups and downs of the stock market how many games the yankees will win this year the flavour of jam am going put on my toast tomorrow morning obsessed finding the proverbial key the universe max lives in paranoid selfimposed solitude

unsettling mood it helps matters that he is not particularly likable protagonist all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed max spindly neuroticlooking individual who has not the time indulge in pleasantries for puts its lead character front and center mr gullette appears in virtually every scene pi takes refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics because of our ambivalence max we are not so much avidly rooting for him triumph moment of epiphany as we are following him through this plot sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination it is more disturbing journey than quest still we do care about maxs fate teetering on the edge of dementia he winds up being pursued two different groups want pick his brain both fronted deliciously perky resolutely cheerful representatives inevitably duplictious intentions as we know in films where paranoia is dominant element see the truman show is laura linney character or for that matter in real life it is always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of be wary pi that addresses patterns itself intentionally adheres an identifiable pattern cycle headache scene important revelation or bit of plot development pillpopping montage hallucinatory nightmare decidedly cronenbergesque undertones few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and bodythemed horror nosebleeding reality the repetitiveness far from being tedious is effectively maddening more than anything the picture aims get under our skins and take in events from maxs claustrophobic perspective in this regard it wildly succeeds due mr aronofskys striking direction it is rarity that so completely immerses itself into protagonists warped perspective of his surrounding and high contrast blackandwhite cinematography combined constant usage of extreme closeups lend heightened sense of paranoia the proceedings in some scenes the stark composition in conjunction the lumbering approach mr gullette make his character curiously resemble latterday max schreck from nosferatu using savage jittery lensing and rapid cuts create sense of disorientation the picture is often dizzying behold and maxs effective isolationism is emphasized shots from the socalled snorri cam keep him in plain focus while the environment races in blurred bursts pis raw aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynchs early work in particular eraserhead the films sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed sly electronic score clint mansell and gradually increases in intensity still amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood pi does occasionally display sense of humour at one point

upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared be hellraiser meets the crow but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue describing the strangers and their reasons for contacting human beings was hooked there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice knew from the start that was going witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character sutherland played the role as true veteran upon the completion of his monologue the camera arrives on sutherland in such fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography would imagine for of this caliber that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most the flowed beautifully as was being taken through the intricate regions of the dark city clever plot began unravel the point where the last time had seen such clever plot twists were in the usual suspects not mention series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green envy but if you are not exactly the biggest scifi fan caveat emptor get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of monkeys or the crow without the boredom or depression the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as monkeys was however so be prepared and be sophisticated and imagine picture that finally does justice the comicbookgonefeaturefilm fad that has recently become abusive of dark city simply puts spawn shame in fact during the climax of the could not help but feel the strong presence of an akira esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie so my initial predictions were wrong this is anything but the meloncholy of hellraiser parts one through five am never one base entirly on special effects so know that when give dark city it is actually because the contained all of the neccessary ingredients keep me entertained and awake from storyline plot twists camerawork even tsk tsk special effects not since contact have recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have been so blown away the best have seen all year and easily one of the best have ever seen,1.0
kadosh means sacred in hebrew amos gitais fictional work after spending most of his career doing documentaries is grim story about failed hasidic marriage even though the marriage is loving one the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israelis modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidics intolerable one as both groups are vying for control of the secular government gitai devarimyom yom is labor party leftist who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government it would sound the death knell of israel the emphasis of the is on how the ultraorthodox jews of that sect live the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women accept their vision of gods law from only the males view that if they ever got control of the country their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are the story takes place in jerusalems jewish quarters called mea shearim where we are taken down sinewy back streets placards pasted on the walls and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life is much different than the way most jews live in israel this is controversial in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are such an extreme patriarchal ones that the is bound anger most viewers no matter their belief it is slowmoving meticulous that grabs hold of you the collar and never lets go the force of what is seen though filmed in an objective manner never taking cheap shot at the hasidim is nevertheless bound leave questions about the nature of such practice of strict observance the is meant be critical of such rigid people as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and their extreme phobic attitudes it makes it impossible for them unite the country when they cannot at present live in harmony their own people and it would be even more impossible imagine them living their arab neighbors in peace the opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual where every prayer is made the virtues of god he even thanks god that he did not make him woman his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according hasidic custom she looks at him glistening eyes not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life and from seeing movies and tv meir is talmudic scholar his father abu warda is rabbi at the yeshiva he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able give him child since the hasidim look upon womans role in life being only conceive children and cook and clean house for the man while the mans role is spend his time in prayer therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage she receives an anonymous letter that states woman without child is no better than dead meirs response is that it is written like that in the talmud meirs father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken man who dies without progeny rips page from the torah all the blame is placed on rivka who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren she will go through countless ritual baths cleanse herself as her rigid mother koenig dunks her in the holy water and says ritual prayer for the times she is dunked as an homage the tribes of israel their religion does not permit them be examined extensively doctor rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile but she cannot tell him that because of their religion so when meirs father chooses younger woman for his son she is exiled live alone in cold apartment in the same jewish quarters rivkas spirited younger sister malka does not want get married but wants live more liberated life she has long time romantic relationship fellow hasidic yaakov but because of the way they were both raised she is still virgin when yaakov joined the israeli army fight in lebanon something his sect is not allowed do he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still believer he now works as singer in nightclub malkas mother is worried that her daughter will not get married so she arranges the rabbi for her marry yossef someone whom she does not love yossef is very stern follower of the order he is also political activist who drives around the city in soundtruck bullhorn urging jews stick together and fight their godless enemies the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options rivka telling her sister accept the marriage it will make her happy but while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it she has other plans ruin this bogus marriage the harshest scene in the is on malkas wedding night yossef prays god for child and then robotically gets malka spread her legs and without the least bit of affection only nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies as he goes inside her and rams her hard thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without word or gesture of love the sisters have choices like everyone else in life does but the choices are obliterated ones beliefs circumstances and inward nature and how difficult it is carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up for the sisters the choices are life or death ones gitai closing in on the daily rituals tight living quarters and closeknit community has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life the ends the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would and everything seems strange her all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories as she has made her choice and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed,1.0
the magnolia can be compared simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins develop they grow farther and farther apart the numerous characters in the are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially from humiliated but kind cop an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion end this loneliness whether this companion is distant family member or spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole searching for the perfect one magnolia is clever well thought out from prodigy directorwriter paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable however what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the is never confusing andersons control over transitioning from one story another story is masterful he also knows exactly when cut another subplot since not one of magnolias scenes drag on too long any three hour that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending from the fascinating beginning the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the just does not get boring it is obvious that anderson put lot of time into connecting each subplot this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation every character is connected every other character at the most two degrees for example cop john reilly is connected game show host phillip baker hall through halls daughter melora walters who once went on date reilly the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer andersons explanation prove this point is both accurate and convincing the only mistake anderson made in trying connect his characters was making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had broadway musical feel it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get the performances in magnolia are perfection this is classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting anderson allows many of hollywoods best supporting actors blossom at what they do best character acting all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in feature length worth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into funny but depressing tour de force performance he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem had the acting was that few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillons character as phillip baker halls wife she seemed be thrown in towards the end and felt very little sympathy for her because had not seen her enough earlier in the magnolia uses several effective metaphors describe its characters anderson has the talent make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only few hours see that anderson is able perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has keen sense of diversity diversity is what makes director successful for long period of time predict lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future,1.0
no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this all recipes are fictions twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism psychological thriller that will scare you the depth of your soul directorwriter antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided giant beasts but instead monsters lurking in ourselves they were party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had resent cannibalism in order stay alive this true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into minutes long motion picture in the united states was land of pioneers of goldstarved americans making their way west it was period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could capt john boyd guy pearce has become both hero and victim during this period of relentless consumption in ways he could never have imagined boyds journey hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during horrific mexicanamerican war battle earns him banishment desolate military outpost waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california upon his arrival he is greeted small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the forts personal emissary the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met bottle of whiskey he did not like reich neal mcdonough the nononsense soldier of the group and the seriously overmedicated cleaves david arquette cook whose meals are inspired more peyote than culinary ambitions into this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers stranger colqhoun robert carlyle halfstarved scot who had been traveling group of settlers until they became snowbound seeking refuge in cave they soon ran out of food and were forced consume one another colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors doeuvre himself our heroes then decide journey through the mountains find the survivors and colqhoun tags along help out soon it becomes clear that colqhouns tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will survive it involves an old indian myth called weendigo states that man who eats the flesh of another steals that persons strength spirit and very essence his hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes there can never be enough and death is the only escape it is all fairly sickening and you have have healthy stomach see the whole movie through as professionally made as the movie is you have wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater see this teenage horror fans will not care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually satire about the pioneer spirit but they will be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces but jokes aside this is that is well worth watching it has wonderful and mature characters that few horror can boast of and strangely effective story that continues electrify you till the end the two main characters are also the most interesting boyd is simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear his sacred wish is live normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood colqhoun is different he proves that man on the brink of death would do anything stay alive including sacrificing his own soul he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts change physically it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen the atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal completely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer here time stands still and nothing changes the inhabitants are soldiers driven war and pillage they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used killing and have not done anything else in their entire life men that are nothing and has nothing loose the result is some sort of cabin fever cannibalism is more like sick game for them since they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying it is like who is going die first the unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind does not move the leaves on the trees resembles kubricks the shining it is hard not get mad here one of the scary aspects of the is strange connection that the viewer establishes the characters and starts understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere strange musical score composed michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation the director herself stated that it was ok laugh during the picture and must admit that it is often very funny in strange way such as the wonderful quote it is lonely being cannibal you do not get that many friends or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat live do not live eat but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change every actor does great job especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged his undeserved honor this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordans interview the vampire actually there are many amusing parallels and connections vampire movies since the topics are so alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues shock and scare until it gets the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring however these little failures do not diminish the impression this is bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations it is scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyones soul dark side we are all trying hide but it is there always it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining said no food did not say there was nothing eat colqhoun ravenous,1.0

most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts my family for the most part hates him and his movies think he is very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of unrestrained physical boundaries allens humor comes shining through those who had problems his physical appearance will be able join the rest of us in laughing at allens intelligent observations of life those who had problems his verbal comedy may want skip this one in was introduced audiences sparked their imaginations and showed them something they would never seen before toy story used stateoftheart computer technology and presented world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present many critics will call that better but believe they only say that because it was completely original motion picture antz however has upped the ante considerably disneys bugs life is not due out for another two months and dreamworks seems have received the better end of the deal beating disney out they have satisfied the audiences thirst for computeranimated films but do not let that fool you disney is definitely not scared in the past two years competitions have broken out between studios in it was the volcano duel in my opinion dantes peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality volcano had an original premise but destroyed that some very ridiculous situations in there are twice as many competing films first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away it is cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact but now it is even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks who will prevail time will tell but am sure that mr mouse has nothing fear this may sound like did not like antz on the contrary would put it up there toy story but due it is pg rating many parents may be put off some of the dialogue should not appear in disneys version some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for familyoriented sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd the humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater attended this is the type of that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents antz begins hilarious monologue seems meld between woody allens shtick and franz kafkas metamorphosis the short story of man who wakes up discover himself as bug allen is troubled ant believing he was not made be worker when you are the middle child in family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood one night is sitting in bar his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life in walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without crown bala asks is he would like dance and they engage in pulp fictionesque dance while everyone else is following the leader after discovering that she is the princess falls in love but there is problem bala is getting married general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader who merely wants control better and stronger colony in order do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants but get rid of the queen he needs get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing die for her he and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up plan send the loyal ants off battle where they will surely be killed the queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony meanwhile wants meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant switch places him so gets sent off battle but he manages survive the slaughter the termites the battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks starship troopers contained very similar sequence however antz and that were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence the second half of the revolves around zs kidnapping of bala and their search for mythical place called insectopia there an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants the adventures and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving magnifying glass looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact am just going assume that the producers referenced id intentionally the ants look up in awe and then beam of fire blasts into the ground visually it is an exciting rush of adrenaline but do not be fooled little kids should not see this as they may just try and copy it after seeing antz vowed never intentionally step on an ant again hopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel as an animated antz is probably the best you will find date visually it is as stunning as what dreams may come the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters are not limited gravity they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible one great moment involves mass of worker ants bunching up form wrecking ball the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck the bottom of young boys shoe it is truly great example of making at its finest computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar the actors providing the voices the best example would have be barbatus danny glover at one point you can even see the pores on his face although doubt ants have pores do they barbatus also has touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words without body young kids may be disturbed the site of dismembered head but good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course disneys bugs life looks good but do not know if they will be able best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation if not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head head the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney vocal talent is always essential an animated feature and antz has one of the best lineups seen since toy story in fact it far exceeds that one woody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what he is done in the past few years without body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing in fact am pretty sure that the writers let him improvise lot of his lines sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed up stone once again is beginning solidify his statement that he wants be an actor not typecast action star after snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is gene hackman is superb as the grufftalking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona christopher walkin is probably more noticed his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns anne bancroft has minimal role but she is effective nonetheless danny glover has small role but he does very very good job dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick eurotrash beesboth are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant who falls in love weaver although most people will not recognize her voice either many people will recognize grant shauds voice as the foreman he played miles on the tv show murphy brown this is definitely huge cast some highprofile names and it will definitely help it is grosses of course you can probably tell where lot of the million budget went also directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct feature headless but both show an incredible talent for this type of picture tense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this together like professionals the screenplay todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains lot of subtlety that makes the more suitable for adults kids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor most of it will go over young childrens heads does that mean you should not take kids see it not at all they will have lot of fun watching this one what is great is the themes that are given us part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community thankfully it is not subtle in either aspects antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home the battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared death and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight but other than that and some sexual innuendos it is perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but it is still advisable leave really young children at home have confused you enough if you do take your kids recommend seeing the them because more than likely you will enjoy it the most,1.0
that is the question asked myself when venturing nervously into the wedding singer the latest star the saturday night live alumnus does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and do nothatemeforbeingasimpleton observations or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people or is it just the fact that he sings songs silly lyrics that bowl audiences over well there is little bit of all of that in the wedding singer and while exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr sandlers thing did have surprisingly good time that is because in nutshell the wedding singer is one of the sweetest movies you are ever likely come across that is right sweet the humor in the runs the gamut from dumb mildly amusing laughoutloud hysterical but the tone well it is just lovely have admit was halfexpecting farting armpit humor gratuitous nudity superfluous cloying subplots and some nasty unnecessary violence instead well have said it before sweet the year is and sandler plays robbie hart the eponymous wedding singer job aspiring rock stars often settle for when robbies fianc dumps him at his own altar robbie gets depressed and turns plucky waitress called julia drew barrymore who has some problems of her own she is marrying hunky junk bonds dealer who unbeknownst her is not that big on monogamy it is not giving anything away say that robbie and julia fall in love aww sandler and barrymore are good match and they are assisted some terrific cameo appearances including steve buscemi and jon lovitz whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the writer tim herlihy uncredited assistance from carrie fisher keeps the story bubbling along its predictable conclusion it does not all work but it is handled such lightheartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans herlihy and director frank coraci have done great job of recreating the sights sounds and affectations of the the soundtrackan everpresent force in the filmis packed walltowall hits of the period new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idols white wedding the smiths how soon is now culture clubs do you really want hurt me the mix of music and fashion would make the wedding singer great double feature boogie nights if you grew up listening the cure and flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs then the wedding singer is bound put nostalgic hop in your stride if you are fan of the lovable laughable adam sandler well let us just say that the wedding singer might well be the only in recent memory make me want rent happy gilmore,1.0

richard linklaters slacker made in for budget of only immerses itself in the twentysomething collegetown culture of austin texas most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial be worth mentioning their lifestyle is sort of passive resistance the idea that people should go out and actively pursue career after graduation they seem content sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy the pervasiveness of slave morality the subtle messages in pop culture and such ask them what they have been doing lately and they will more likely than not reply oh you know just hanging out linklater uses an interesting technique examine these characters the camera follows one person for few minutes then someone else walks and the camera follows that person who walks into diner just as another person is walking out the door it is certainly lot of fun listening these characters talk some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas some of them are just plain weird and some of them think their ideas are lot more profound than they really are the opening monologue delivered linklater himself taxi driver tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships the history of anarchist philosophy while groups of pseudointellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle briberybased morality in scoobydoo for the most part however the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types near the beginning paranoid man follows pedestrian for several blocks warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming secret colonization of mars another man seems be collecting televisions keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of graduate student who recorded himself having nervous breakdown and destroying the camera and in scene that drew big laugh from everyone present when saw the man tries achieve closure after failed relationship reciting poetry on bridge and then throwing typewriter into the creek below the only problem slacker is that it starts run out of steam towards the end since linklater only spends few minutes each character the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after while there are only so many times you can hear hey what is going on not much what are you up nothing really just hanging around before it gets on your nerves the might well have benefited from slightly slower pace and little bit more characterization and the dialogue in the second half of the is and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half jfk buff for example seems like pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist and many of the characters just generally are not as weird or unique instead of depicting city populated mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first linklater shows us the oddballs first then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too slacker is good and wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy whatever its flaws and its status as cult classic is welldeserved just cannot help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order,1.0
breed apart casts rutger hauer as crazy birdloving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner bit hard swallow that is only the first of many improbabilities in this hauer stars as man obsessed keeping the birds on his island safe while boothe plays guy hired steal couple of rare eagle eggs rich egg collector turner is the woman caught between the two men breed apart is not bad movie exactly indeed found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters even though their goals could not be more different the problem the is that there are just too many inconsistencies for example early on in the hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at his birds later on the rednecks come back for revenge four other people and hauer kills few of them have tough time believing that the police would not get involved at that point another problem is the silly lovetriangle that develops did not care one way or the other who ended up turner was more interested in finding out of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions however despite this uninteresting subplot turner did manage give great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there is more life than money and birds as for hauer he is an actor have always admired he has penchant for picking strange and unusual characters and this one is no exception he is frequently seen riding around his island on white horse wearing pirates clothing and holstering crossbow despite all his eccentric mannerisms though hauer always manages let the human side of his character shine through for example there is scene in he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island day early he comes off as crazy loner in that scene but few minutes later he is apologizing turner and we believe his intentions soon after we find out he is vietnam vet and his actions become fairly clear us breed apart is not great movie any means but it does contain good performances all three leads and it is worth seeing for that reason alone,1.0
titanic is so close being the perfect movie it is upsetting that it is not the cost million make and could of put th century fox into lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the we all know that big budget dosent mean great see waterworld but titanic is far superior kevin costners waterlogged epic but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of camerons best films the starts present day explorers searching the runied titanic they find safe and inside picture of woman the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning poker game wins two tickets board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool go america also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into marriage man she dosent love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries kill them oh yeah and the ship sinks and that is the main problem the and stops it from being work of genius the story and script both cameron are both weak the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has marry the poor boy heart the stuckup mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of injokes of how the boat will not sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic it is shame really as the audience does have sit through hours of this without good dialogue could become very long very boring like camerons own terminator but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear firstly there is camerons direction there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end there is lot of mayhem and panic all done very well cameron it is scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below thanks camerons direction then the audiences attention is held for the full hours minutes support the directing are the excellent cast working very well their underwritten characters dicaprio is good although he only looks years old his performance of over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines winslet is great also and her transistion from well mannered rich girl rebelous young adult is pretty smooth zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line sneer and flicker of the eye lash the audience really does come hate him he may be playing the same character he plays in every he is in like dead calm but he does it really really well also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands as loud mouthed american finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects cameron is whiz effects just watch aliens terminator and true lies and they are used very well throughout the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well the humans seem move smoothly there is just something odd about them you can tell that they have been animated on computer of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has be seen be believed titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the titanic then is wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the could of come in under three hours few more cuts titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is wonderful attempt at creating work of genius enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is cinema was invented for filling the screen incredible images and assaulting the ears awesome sound superb but sadly not perfect overall rating,1.0
on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away making those statements in case you missed it warren beatty plays politician on the campaign trail he says black congregation if you cannot cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than running back who stabs his wife you are never gonna get rid of me well there is such plot and it works very well in this comedy beatty plays jay billington bulworth longtime democratic senator from california the movie opens on painfully repetitious montage of bulworths latest commercials condemning affirmative action the montage is ironically intercut pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working jack kennedy when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv having gone without food or sleep for days his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him care first he calls lobbyist from the insurance industry get bribe million life insurance policy in his daughters name then he calls an associate arrange for his own assassination his assistant murphy oliver platt is oblivious bulworths suicidal state and drags him his speaking engagements bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an africanamerican church then takes questions from the audience he is hit hard questions about his voting record he had promised money help rebuild the community after the riots and it has not shown up since he is dead man anyway he figures he will answer truthfully he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came a for the photo opportunity they made some promises that improved their public image for while and then counted on the media and the public eventually forget about the promises they made the shock and outrage from the congregation grows the questions keep coming and he keeps shooting back honest if ugly answers before go further would like make distinction that the denver post failed make and that is that characterizing africanamericans as maltliquor drinking j fans is not part of bulworths truth that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics this line is not what they are talking about the experience is liberating nothing left lose bulworth is no longer restricted burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth he can say whatever he wants because he is going be dead anyway why not tell the people the truth about being sleazy politician that he is bought and paid for lobbyists and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism bulworths candor wins him three volunteers from the church one of whom nikki halle barry he gets crush on he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something chicken wings appropriately enough bulworth shows up late for his meeting some movie studio executives when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings bulworth drifts the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment so much money and so many talented people working so hard he wonders why cannot make quality product you go warren when they become indignant and ask why he is talking them if he has such low opinion of their product he callously admits that it is because they are rich jews that night he drops the three africanamerican volunteers at their nightclub and he decides go in them he stays up all night drinking smoking pot dancing falling in love nikki and learning scratch turntables and rap the next day he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps the suitandtie fundraisers from then on at all of his political appearances he raps his political truth his rap is not bad for middleaged white guy he is not very good but it is his first try and at least he is not embarrassingly bad his lobbyists are not amused but the rest of his constituency seems like the new bulworth eventually the movies plot remember he hired hit man overtakes the politics is too bad screen time is spent bulworth trying cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems be closing in on him there are even few gratuitous chase scenes bulworth fleeing his killer these scenes may have been necessary keep the events of the moving along but it distracted and detracted from bulworths political ranting was much more interesting than the everpresent obviouslooking assassin still most of the movie is original and very enjoyable and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it the screen as the story and screen writer he came up first good structure then good dialogue back it up jeremy pikser cowrote the screenplay as an actor he was able convincingly portray bulworths depression then liberation and rebirth as producer there were four others he was able keep the movie free from hollywoods indulgent formulas except for those inexcusable chase scenes someone else probably could have directed but since he was there anyway what the heck it is too bad that there are not more movies like this around movies that tackle political corruption in way that challenges viewers pay more attention real politics after all much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news just little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants just do not expect be popular the insurance companies,1.0

the summer movie season is still in its infancy but after diasappointing films such as godzilla and fear and loathing in las vegas it would be nice see really good but doubt you could have expected this the truman show is one of the most unique films have ever seen and it deserves spot on the decades best list there is no way isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim yes that is what makes this great the blend of peter weirs masterful and in many ways brilliant direction peter bizious stunning photography and jim carreys performance is what makes this work so fantastically there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame but everything about this looks intentional and perfect carrey has made very wise choice playing mildmannered truman burbank he allows himself enough room be comical and therefore not alienating his true fans while still showing vulnerable and human side that is side has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes truman burbank was born an audience of millions he was chosen before birth be the focus of hour television show everything in his environment is controlled team of technicians led the show is director christof played ed harris everyone in trumans life is an actor or an extra they are all being watched millions of people around the globe people who can tune in at any time of the day see what is happening in trumans life but he is the only person that is not aware of it the classification of the truman show may be tricky the audience reacted many of trumans revelations laughter did not laugh much during the because was so emotionally wrapped up the character the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes because what was happening him indeed what had been done him his whole life was wrong so is this going end up labeled as comedy drama it really depends on the audience but me the truman show was touching sad tale about the extents corporation will go exploit human life for the entertainment of others but above all else the truman show was stunningly beautiful picture humor heart and scary realism oscar predictions in june are pointless but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of as originally planned james cameron would be oscarless,1.0
one way of telling if is good or not is the length if is only minutes but feels like minutes then it is crap but if last hours and feels like minutes then it is excellent boogie nights falls into the latter catagory the director anderson delivers funny hip yet sometimes violent flies along mark whalberg k marky mark plays eddie adams seventeen year old certain gift in the midriff area jack horner reynolds is adult director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business after running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies in the movie business dirk meets whole load of characters the introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets know them pretty well thanks the excellent script we learn about ambers grief about not being able see her child due divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps everyone except her husband but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing the direction is fast thrilling and never holds up there are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches the writing is fabulous some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most films such as the lost world jurassic park or tommorow never dies boogie nights really is spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantinos films resevoir dogs and pulp fiction the soundtrack is also excellent like american graffiti the features some great old songs on the soundtrack heightens the atmosphere and gives the an extra lift also the costumes are great the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties the although excellent does have some flaws firstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes require him be angry in both scenes where he has act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost but the rest of the cast are excellent burt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william macy is great aswell but he always is another flaw the though is that the ending seems bit tacked on it seems anderson saw the was going on bit and needed wrap up quickly it is shame really as the rest of the is perfectly paced but they are small niggles really boogie nights is an excellent superb directing writing acting and music all combine make one spectacular whatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights,1.0
it is ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directors cut of the films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator are all prime examples of filmmakers integrity later chopped up or mucked the studio the advent of the dvd format has provided more accessible way get these original cuts the public and provide freaks like myself the ability become further enraptured the extension of such classic films the dvd release of the original international version of luc bessons masterpiece the professional is known as on around the world is prime example of how good can become an instant classic as directors cut for years have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format has eluded me for years even bought laserdisc player from my uncle don for bucks just watch certain directors cuts including on but after countless searches in laserdisc stores could never find it until now the follows the story of on played jean reno professional hit man for an italian mob crew run danny aiello he lives next door ferociously independent yearold girl named mathilda played then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops one day crew of the cops lead gary oldman in an overthetop performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries taking pity on her on hides her in his apartment when she returns save her life mathilda learns of ons hit man profession and decides follow in ons footsteps as cleaner she then falls in love him and manages reawaken emotions within on he has kept locked away as part of his profession at this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in the international version contains an additional minutes of footage that pertains directly the relationship of on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences handle the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathildas and ons motivations pertaining later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops there is even previously unseen cameo the great french actor jeanhugues anglade star of queen margot bessons la femme nikita and killing zoe these additional scenes replaced on and matildas relationship brings you emotionally closer the and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version the most ironic thing about the international version of the is that the inclusion of the missing scenes the becomes primarily heavy emotional drama punctuated big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the the betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema my advice everyone out there is throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece directorwriter luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello,1.0

this is about secrets some that are innocent like those of cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley others that are between married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for big corporation called fex and striving get patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healylouie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order make the marriage work and still other secrets that have greater implication for the world and are deadly in political sense of science carried out the big corporations like it was business run for the bottom line receiving summer grant study chemoelectric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her he has slyly managed keep his work as secretive as possible locking himself in the lab is off limits her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is benefit humanity possible new treatments and cures illnesses his main argument is that this is what the public wants they do not want hear about how some animals had die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science that he is depicted as monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed the director against his bad science science as business as opposed the good science science that cares about the small farmer is represented the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david young ecologist who chooses work in the field trying get the farmers go back organic farming he is hired the university monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced use survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed the big companies enhance their profit margins the third view in all this is the artists represented lillian who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why should not the same be true of the scientist she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient get ahead his research feels bogged down the bureaucrats in his firm who fail provide him the three chimps he needs experiment on as he contacts one of the companys higher ups argue his case but decides he cannot wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances dog that means so much her and her family because he saved her life while out in the field the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted alex and one of his coworkers and nervously invites them dinner his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the as all the main characters get chance speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything the scientists engage in rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly davids view but coming at it from much different angle it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the directors point of view is absolutely right is beside the point the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters geoffrey was likened hideous monster alex vine was likened his last name the one who holds fast the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending lot of time together lillian as these two seem share the same views and are physically attracted each other but when the time is ripe for an affair take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not go up alexs apartment geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems be coming apart and all his cunning tricks possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely the dog is discovered alex and her in deplorable state after geoffrey is seen them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies the only thing left for her do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails respond davids loving gesture for her stay him instead opting head back the city the farmer whose dog was tortured death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of phone conversation one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way what is progress what can one expect out of life is the small farmer about become extinct the answers these questions can best be answered either good science or art are both closely related the american natives vision of world entrusted mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it his creations benefit mankind in peaceful way that this work fails be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart that tried so hard say what it felt it had say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience catch on its message not making everything seem so black and white no telling said lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic there is something about listening lecture that turns off the rebel in me as do not like being hit in the head the truth but prefer have it presented in the form that leads inspiration or told metaphorically that is not say that found the without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the needed show that there is mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso as guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares really see what is going on will not mistake side of the fence he or she should be on the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires raise family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized her monster of husband all in the name of science had raw power it that personalizes the dangers of bad science perhaps the most pertinent question the asks requires an answer that must be resolved the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married art,1.0

you may not have heard of lucas or if you have you might not think much of it probably because it stars corey haim or maybe because it is about little geek who collects insects or maybe because it does not feature slick oneliners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost requirement for teen films in the however you have been missing out on true masterpeice the best of and the best about adolescent life ever made corey haim stars as lucas bligh tiny year old scruffy hair thick glasses and an interest in insects and other outdoor life one day he stops the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel him her name is maggie year old who certainly is beauty lovely red hair and sweet innocent complexion maggie seems be little disturbed this little kid watching her but somehow he interests her and soon they are talking and getting know one another they gradually become good friends and spend the summer together doing various things such as studying insects namely locusts who come out of hiding once every years playing tennis and listening symphony orchestra through manhole cover lucas is obviously in love maggie and while she is charmed him it is clear that she would never consider him anything more than very good friend this is not clear lucas however he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what is about happen we soon find out why in painful scene where lucas is humiliated the jocks during pep rally they throw him on stage right in front of his beloved maggie surprisingly he turns the tables on the jocks some clowning around but he takes it too far and is embarassed in front of the entire school the next scene is brilliant maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally she tries talk him as if nothing happened he rails back against her in cruel unfair fashion in lesser movies this would have turned into confrontation between the two characters but maggie is written smarter than that she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what say console him next we are introduced another great character named cappie charlie sheen he is jock typical cheerleader girlfriend what is interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks of course anyone brain can tell what is gonna happen next cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone she is been assigned show him how operate the washerdryer so he can clean his shirt maggie is charmed cappies tender undertsanding demeanor not mention his shirtless body this scene is so delicate and sweet but cappie still has girlfriend preventing either one from acting on their desires desperately trying puncture the tension cappie begins kick basketballs around the room it is not long before cappie does break up his girlfriend in the films only subpar scene lucas finally figures out what is going on when he tries pick maggie up for the dance this causes him take severe actions prove himself maggie and himself such as try out for the football team the last third of the revolves around this attempt while the idea seems cliched the way it is executed is not there are many surprises during the last half hour lead an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up dave grusins memorable score played at the perfect moments certainly helps lucas is filled great performances forget everything you know about corey haim back in he had talent and that is proven here as he delivers perfect fully dimensional performance filled anger humor and pain kerri green is very appealing as maggie showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted her sheens cappie is almost too good be true but sheen makes him beleivable especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popittis ben friend of lucas whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks also turning up in few key scenes is winona ryder as rina the girl who admires lucas from afar when people talk about the great teen angst films of the you hear john hughes this and john hughes that lucas seems be lost among the crowd of his socalled classics but hopefully like heathers and say anything lucas can begin find it is own loyal following and help people realize there were more the than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald it deserves more than that but do not want be greedy,1.0
in arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved very mixed reaction sure blockbuster despite the fact the script and plot is bit of let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department in terms of characters far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala natalie portman whose mature performance far exceeds her tender years of age she is one hot babe who defines true woman leadership she not only has presence but knows how take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination no thanks the jedi knights who although led the force lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up plan do anything the young obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who has bad hair day in every scene gets kill bad guy in the end but lacks love interest make him desirable sort of hero in fact all the jedi knight are bit asexual there must be something about the force makes them all hermits and loners mean it would be interesting see yodas girlfriend for change if he has one not much better is quigon jinn liam neeson who mostly broods and has better hair do than obiwan but only find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life also fascinating is george lucas metoclorian theory claims that microorganisms live within our cells and tie us the fabric of the universe and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual make them particularly powerful in the force more humerous are the claims the immaculate conception of darth vader no doubt concept stolen from the christian faith except there will be no christmas celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force overall an experience is not be missed because of the very fact that it is predecessor almost command viewing of this inferior successor all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition the clan watch out for the next one it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker who believe should be portrayed leonardo di caprio,1.0

i know that funnest is not word fun is noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that is the word that came me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you childish expressions like that was the funnest movie have ever seen so hell websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies have seen in while cannot remember the last time have seen anything funner the chickens at tweedys farm are up something living in concentration camplike atmosphere they are led one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises teach the chickens how fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides abandon the farms eggselling plan for pieselling plan she orders huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming codirector peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference the ballbouncing scene some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the does not feel like it is been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up the idea make prisonersofwar movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it is worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and them it is but they are chickens so it is funny us another thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods the very films they are cribbing there are references the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there is even nod the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and history the braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year have seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they are parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run does not lean on its parodies the references are never the sole focus of any scene if you have never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it is understood and as result chicken run is filled visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie does not require knowledge of history but if you have got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it is hard not fall in love every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but soft heart that forbids her leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gungho veneer the characters inevitable romance does not feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly is not any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence they even come up an inspired riff on something that is baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke come off as wearisome but as most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise the manages cross all barriers it should be accessible both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is firstrate remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention detail as in such topnotch family fare as bugs life or toy story chicken run has something offer in nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they will catch all the details anyway the movies just boatload of fun funnest damn movie have seen all year,1.0

written john grisham and robert altman as al hayes directed robert altman some time ago young director was given the opportunity direct the screen version of popular novel the novel was summer smash topping bestseller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as popular actors of the day might play the leads the only problem the novel was not very good it was far more pulp than pulitzer but the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not great writer was fantastic storyteller so he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen the director francis ford coppola the book of course was mario puzos the godfather the rest as they say in showbiz was history bringing up the godfather do not mean suggest that robert altmans the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness but the parallel does suggest that it is possible create great cinema from questionable source material can you get any more questionable than john grisham depends on whom you ask but there is no question that grishams work grabs people like puzo grisham is better storyteller than writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is good idea man but who cannot tell wellconstructed story from can of spam so something in grishams unpublished story of cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers the result is gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon from its opening shot the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated sense of dread fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe this terrific sense of mood is classic altman touch witness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear we roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on red sports car speeding over bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone right away we know that the driver of that car is in for few surprises pay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived john grisham but altman this is what great director can do for questionable source material the sports car belongs rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases magruder has just won high profile case and celebrates that night catered party at his office outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen driven southern chivalry driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction the fragile waitress magruder offers her ride home there he learns more about mallorys life than he bargained for her car was stolen her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall ted kyzynskistyle whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter magruder perhaps influenced mallorys decision strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic her plight and offers help her get her father committed right after he sleeps her of course this simple offer of help leads magruder down dangerous path black end he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in mental hospital and for moment all appears well but then dixons crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger the cops will not lift finger help liberal attorney his only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling privateeye sidekick clyde robert downey jr if this predicament was not bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos altman may provide the atmosphere but branaghs performance holds the gingerbread man together an accomplished actor when he is not directing himself in vanity productions branagh does fine job of making rick sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives is his offer of help mallory an act of kindness or of egotism magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has swallow it and then it is too late as the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are and life is never so bad that it cannot get worse if you are familiar altmans work you will recognize several of his signature techniques characters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action dialog overlaps and the actors seem slip naturally into an improvisational style and of course there is my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot thanks altman here are some of the actresses have had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand and now can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous the altman as the director cameo was the hitchcock is it oldschool sexism or clever injoke you be the judge but back the picture at hand in the hands of mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others we have all endured in the hands of master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake tried for the same result what may prevent it from enduring altmans greatest work is weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grishams story so it appears that altman had throw in the hurricane just jazz things up but there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough see you through that polygram so hated this picture that they tried steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are they probably wanted it look more like time kill and that my friends should make you very afraid,1.0
october sky is rare oddity in cinema selfproclaimed uplifting that is actually uplifting based on the autobiographical book homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream it is and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there is not much hope of rosy future coalwood is coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage escape on football scholarship most of coalwoods boys are destined work in the mine but in october an event happens that sparks one boy dream the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal dream future of rocketry and space travel of course homers parents chris cooper and natalie canderday are not quite sure what make of their sons unusual interests homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered the winners of national science fair and so stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins build rocket but do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny there is lot that could have gone wrong october sky nearly every sequence flirts becoming syrupy and cliched however miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times emerges manages be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this from the outset of the he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as alienate the audience unfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick they remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here of the adults in the chris cooper is the most fully realized character the never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his childs dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn realize what that is director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages dodge however there are still few occasions when he allows things proceed just step too far scenes were natural and inspiring start become contrived and artificial however these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course the problem many socalled uplifting films is that they attempt force their mediciney goodness down your throat october sky never resorts that level and yet manages become truly uplifting purely on its own merits,1.0

while watching boiler room was constantly reminded of last years masterpiece fight club both films consist of predominately male cast both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator who eventually realizes that these men have be stopped while boiler room writerdirector ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club he does contribute another impressive work series of films aiming represent the new generation generation has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants be millionaire paying homage oliver stones classic wall street younger is almost modernizing the tale using younger hipper actors play the greedy villains as opposed the older more experienced types as is true in real life younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages another similarity fight club is that both films are not action flicks some people are convinced that an allmale cast automatically means there must be gory violence here is proof that this is not true if you want see an action movie starring ben affleck go see reindeer games this weekend if you want see smart insightful excellent acting and clever script see boiler room giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the films narrator seth after dropping out of college and running lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment seth is offered high paying job wealthy man nicky katt he agrees take the job in you are guaranteed become millionaire within three years of selling stock welloff americans from the midwest over the telephone and begins fit in quite well his coworkers learning tricky techniques deceive innocent people into buying shares of good in production seth figures this is too good be true after stumbling into room at the wrong time he knows there is something no good about this company at this point seth is left the ultimate choice continue the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes ron rifkin playing seths dad the two have perfect chemistry as troubled father and son trying impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves the transitions from anger sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire the supporting cast of greedy coworkers is also flawless ben affleck shines in short but sweet performance as recruiter for the company nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt the energy of the cast as whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring the only major error in the is that nothing major happens there is no big plot twist or climatic point make the more memorable due the lack of major event boiler room never finds suitable genre fit into the movie is not intense enough be thriller the romantic segments involving seth and abby nia long are not properly finalized and the dialogue is not funny enough make it comedy in having trouble characterize the movie as whole boiler room is slightly confused at times it does not seem know category fit itself into one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole for the better otherwise the movie is fun watch thanks its lively cast of young actors,1.0
ok let us get one thing straight right away maximum risk is no battleship potemkin although it does have some russians in it but it is not too bad really it is the new from ringo lam the latest hong kong filmmaker defect and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium jeanclaude van damme who you will recall also starred in john woos maiden effort hard target in lams van damme plays alain moreau french cop at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from twin brother who was adopted russians these russians defected the united states and moved into black neighbourhood in new york where suppose they thought they would not be noticed this brother mikhail suverov played in his few scenes well you know becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi almost the same thing guess and is killed in france in the movie things happen so fast that you do not have too much time think about how weird this all is moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes new york find out why mikhail was killed and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed we wonder the same thing still do in little odessa he meets mikhails girlfriend alex natasha henstridge last seen in species who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably the miseenscene she has very nice breasts and we get seen them briefly in this movie it was rated in the us but is pg here so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do this lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow the fugitive hard target or anything starring arnold but that works its benefit think after all one thing that is been missing from woos films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love well some of us do movies like this should not be too pretentious and that is part of the problem some of these other films they try be too big in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions but they do not overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative not too much anyway the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions even if at times they do not make hell of lot of sense in fact one of the more interesting aspects of the is minor character rather overeager new york cabbie frank van keeken from tvs kids in the hall who begins as something of joke but becomes an important part of the story unfortunately the time we have come really get interested in him he well you will see the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots one is fight in russian sauna lots of sweaty muscular male flesh this one will appeal certain parts of the audience more than others bullets in heads and vodka another my personal favorite is fight in meat packing house featuring pig carcasses and chainsaw and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than as they trash those quaint french cafes vegetable carts and well french people that we all know in our hearts deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint of course the movie does have its share of silliness for example while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he is getting alain stops long enough look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror he has been whacking the guy on the head in an unnecessarily dramatic moment he apparently is shocked at what he sees at what he has become but what has he become tough cop who beats the hell out of guy who tried kill him does not sound too unreasonable me considering the genre but let us face it any time van damme tries be dramatic he looks silly so maximum risk is little different from most other action films while watching it was surprised and little disappointed in the relative lack of pyrotechnics but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing sugar rush after the initial excitement there is not much left although it is short on spectacle lams leaves better and more lasting impression think am more impressed it now than was while watching it and me that is good sign go see maximum risk but do not expect typical action movie expect sort of funky hong konghollywood action movie the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice dr white teaches at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore but we do not hold this against him,1.0

you will go ape over tarzan because it is more fun than barrel of monkeys okay there is the quote in case disney wants put something in their ads for the movie disneys latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as small family attempts escape from sinking ship father mother and infant somehow make it shore amidst rousing song phil collins and have soon built treehouse would impress the swiss family robinson it is amazing the kinds of things you can do when you work soundtrack before you know it an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala glenn close mother ape who recently lost her own baby predatory leopard against the wishes of her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes on the infant boy as her own tarzan is not so much story about human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild much of tarzans young life is spent trying become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his father occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how wellmeant his attempts all he is looking for is acceptance perhaps goal easily identifiable young viewers but one will ring true lot of adults when you really think about it this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end look back on past disney animated features and you will see the trend growing up tarzan voiced alex linz as child and tony goldwyn as an adult has couple of friends one is an ape named terk rosie odonnell and the other is paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor wayne knight both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come mind and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed the disney mold am beginning think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films just fill in the blanks can you see it now we have have couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him or come his rescue when he needs it we have already had fish and crab and we have had candle and teapot genie and dog few stone statues have we had an ape and an elephant yet well there we go of course there is gotta be romance somewhere along the line so jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through together her father dr porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane is on an expedition find and study the wild gorillas of africa she discovers the man raised apes and is enchanted almost immediately and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory you tarzan me jane scene thankfully those are not the exact words however found it distracting that tarzan is going ohh ohh ee ee one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice perfect diction how does he tell his name another ape ohh ohh ee tarzan ee ee ohh well regardless of my picky nature the romance actually works as only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable but hey tarzans young adult do you think he dated few of the female apes before meeting jane is not that illegal in most countries oh well do not think disney will be using my quote anymore tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not musical there is lots of music be sure but not single character song in the whole hour and half of running time we instead get more of phil collins concert as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material this is not really bad thing as the songs are very highenergy and catchy found myself singing one myself for most of the following day it is just different do yourself favor and see this in theater good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie each new feature disney animation gets even better not necessarily leaps and bounds but since they put out new each year steady rate of improvement is apparent and this definitely shows in tarzan there are couple of scenes where the animation achieves near effect and number of scenes feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had me thinking this is not just tarzan it is extreme tarzan however tarzan does not seem have what call its chandelier scene is the one scene the animators have chosen devote an inordinate amount of effort utilizing computerassisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking lasting but few seconds at most it is been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast in the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail as usual the voice talent is up snuff convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters the one poor choice in casting however was rosie odonnell going into the did not know she was even part of it but when terk started talking recognized her voice immediately her performance was fine but through the rest of the kept thinking that is no boy ape that rosie odonnell distracting say the least will admit have never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan of the apes so could not tell you how true this stays the book but unless you are purist you should have few objections this solid performances action adventure bit of romance and great music and animation tarzan should appeal the kids and the kid in all of us note when wrote my review of mulan year ago went off on the promotional and merchandising tieins prevalent the release of disney animated feature this time will just say that went mcdonalds yesterday treat myself mcflurry and tarzan was on the cup nuff said,1.0

according movies made in last few decades life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen human being even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate grow up in those dark godforsaken places and later forced live forever traumatised the experience on the other hand it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view this is amarcord comedy famous italian director federico fellini later gave inspiration numerous imitations and homages and even led few american screen artists adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life the is based on the screenplay fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense instead we follow one year in italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs as well as series of local often very colourful characters although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist year old boy titta played bruno zanin and chronicles his sexual frustrations obsession local beauty queen named gradisca played magali noel problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family as well as troubles his father played armando brancia have mussolinis fascist regime amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia and it probably explains why it is very popular even among those people who actually do not like federico fellinis work very much every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this because fellini in this clearly illustrates natural human desire paint past in the best way possible distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the word amarcord is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase remember in local italian dialect in the same way the word is distorted so is the past in memories of those who remember it after the premiere fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this but it does not matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellinis childhood or not any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this fellinis views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated way he mixes reality and fantasy in this even the most naturalistic scenes are laced dark humour and grotesque images characters look like caricatures actors playing them often deliberately overact and women especially those who fuel tittas sexual fantasies often have certain body parts gargantuan proportions every now and then scenes that depict reality gradually slide into fantasies of movies characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions because of that almost everything in this looks different and in most cases better than it would have looked in the real life even the fascism gets fellinian makeover fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history and opportunity for comedy when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour unlike many of his italian colleagues in who had used period setting explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda fellini does not care that much about politics lack of selfrighteous moral perspective is compensated fellinis humanistic approach his characters each of them regardless of age gender social class or physical appearance is given opportunity express his or her views dreams and fears fellini treats all those characters warmth and affection even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people because of this warmth and democratic spirit amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of th century and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable melancholic and even tragic moments fellini could not produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave very personal touch this movie vignettes are not memorable because of the characters only fellini uses camera painting in bright colours especially in the scenes that depict characters fantasies fellini also knows how use locations whether such location happens be luxurious hotel brightcoloured beach or rural countryside even the downtoearth streets of rimini where everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension during the snowfall on the other hand lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene this atmosphere is also provided incredible talent of composer and fellinis longtime associate nino rota his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of music ever produced that music alone should be the reason view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art,1.0

lean mean escapist thrillers are tough product come most are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency the thrillride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive featured none of the flashbang effects of todays market but rather breadandbutter textbook example of what clever script and good direction is all about the latest tony scott movie enemy of the state does not make it that level it is true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through maze of cell phones and laptop computers without looking back although director scott has made missteps in the past such as the lame thriller the fan he is generated good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun that vibrant spirit is present here shown in welltimed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography director of photography daniel mindel throws staggering amount of different views angles lenses and stocks at the audience that goes long way toward involving the audience in the movie enemy is truly visual experience and that is only one of the reasons it is such fun watch the movie lights up an aging senator visited nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds jon voight reynolds wants new communications act passed allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment but the senator plans bury the bill in committee reynolds has the senator offed but not before the murder is caught on naturalists camera an extremist chain of events the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean will smith posession and it is not long before he is running from reynolds cronies it is only the help of an exspook named brill gene hackman that dean is able get the bottom of things the acting is top notch and the three principles smith hackman and voight are generally more mature and excellent all around smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes normal human being voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role smiths regular joe comes off particularly well as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not the supports are also in fine form lending credibility the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas this is for the holiday crowd the hot ticket as well as anyone looking for serving of genuine action in market that is otherwise lacking,1.0
this is based on the campy tv show from the under the same appellation mind you most people including yours truly who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series the movie is really stand alone in that regard the family robinson lost in space plot set in the year the family robinson is chosen sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order survive its future colonization process if you will they are joined able pilot west leblanc and evil uninvited stowaway oldman who does not want see the trip conclude on successful tip eventually their trek goes awry and all are lost in space how do get back earth is the question that infests the rest of this scifi epic critique this reminded me lot of the fifth element from the summer of it is lot of flash but very little actual substance admittedly there is not an annoying character like chris tucker from the other but this does run little too long and did lose me in regards its complex timetravel multidimensional story line having said that the special effects in this movie were amazing and the overall look and feel were also way above average you really felt like you were in the future and riding through space these poor souls unfortunately for this chosen family their year old son is the smartest one in the group and the father is too wrapped up in his work notice the rest of his family ever heard that one before yawn the acting is ok and was especially surprised at the solid performance tv friends matt leblanc who shows us all that he is definitely more than just pretty face on the down side the family riffraff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and timeconsuming even though we gotta give them credit for trying develop characters in scifi pic the story line is hard follow the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he is evil and the movie goes on for about minutes too long on the slick side many of the special effects are really cool the sequence in the family is paralyzed during the hyperdrive is awesome and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool the credit presentation at the end of the is slamming and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling will also admit that somehow they got me semitear up near the conclusion of this picture very odd overall if you are big scifi fan check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative and if you are not would still suggest seeing this movie but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts little known facts this will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic out of the top spot at the boxoffice after straight weeks at number one garry oldman is british and was once married uma thurman for about six months mimi rogers was tom cruises first wife,1.0

most sequels do not do what they are supposed do like toy story does far too many of them end up rehashing the original and adding very little is it any wonder that most sequels fail live up their predecessors thankfully toy story is wonderful exception cannot remember the last time saw sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one it is yet another sign that pixar the acclaimed animation studio behind toy story and bugs life is still at the top of its game woody and buzz are back in the sequel the hit toy story and things have changed bit since the last one ended woody voiced tom hanks is preparing leave his owner andy for cowboy camp in his absence he has assigned buzz lightyear tim allen now comfortable in his role as toy take charge unfortunately woodys trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale and is stolen an overzealous toy collector wayne knight off save him are buzz and members of the old toy gang including mr potato head don rickles rex the nervous dinosaur wallace shawn hamm the piggy bank john ratzenberger and slinky dog jim varney while in captivity woody makes startling discovery he is actually part of collection of toys based on s childrens show entitled woodys roundup he meets the show is other characters include jesse joan cusack his cowgirl sidekick the wise old prospector kelsey grammer and bullseye his trusty horse they have all been anxiously awaiting woodys arrival as once their set is completed they will be sold japanese toy museum and finally escape storage forever this means woody now faces difficult choice his friends coming rescue him does he go them and spend few more years andy or does he go japan and be immortalized forever as in the original toy story contains firstrate animation and pixar studios has done remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there reportedly the was originally slated for directtovideo release but after seeing the improvements that had been made disney rightly decided release it into theaters the is well worth seeing on the big screen the colors are bright the textures sharp and even the human characters look more human the animation is consistently seamless the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable there are so many impressive sequences that would find it impossible list them here but was particularly wowed scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across busy intersection get al toy barn the store owned woodys captor pixars rendition of the family dog is also nicely done fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it the voice work is also perfectly complementary and as the first movie does much help further character development tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz making you forget who is doing the voice it was woody and buzz up there not tom and tim all the cast members from the original reprise their roles and each is excellent several new voices have been added joan cusack kelsey grammer and wayne knight doing fine work toy story is strong in characterization and is able expand on what we saw in the first movie woody faces difficult choices while buzz is confronted new buzz who has not yet realized his status as toy forcing him see what he used be like the new characters are also developed quite well especially jesse who narrates sarah mclachlanaided flashback illustrating how she was loved then forgotten her owner it may be computeranimated and it may have sappy music but it is downright touching the script despite having story and screenplay each credited four different writers is endlessly clever and inventive especially considering that it is sequel the reason toy story works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses just capitalize on the originals success redoing the same story and using the same characters not this one we get character change new characters and new issues brought up toy story is also remarkable for the way in it keeps reinventing itself there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here the humor is sharp and witty something amuse both kids and adults there are funny asides films such as star wars and jurassic park among others new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots and appearances from other pixar efforts bugs life and the short geri game geri himself makes an appearance as toy repairman who fixes woodys broken arm the action is fast and furious and the chases in the street in toy store in an elevator on baggage carousel and in an airplane keep getting bigger and better toy story never grows stagnant because there is always something new hold your interest the more you pay attention it the more rewarding it is it is rare see like toy story come along because it is the kind of that is almost impossible dislike it is created purely entertain and though enjoy thoughtprovoking drama as much as the next person it is nice see that films are still trying do exactly what movies first tried do send us out smile it is fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing toy story it is the rare sequel that manages expand on and live up the original,1.0
expectation rating bit worse than expected mainly because found the middle part be bit dull roger ebert gave it four star review and while he is critic that uses the full scale and often agree such as dark city being the best of he must have seen better read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it the opening of simple plan reminded me bit of the sweet hereafter the landscape is snowy and cold and is filmed what feel is in rather crisp manner also reminds me of fargo loathed one can almost sense the cold but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead instead raimi has made more constrained probably is for the better this is probably not movie that would have been improved lots of odd shots the movie also reminded me of affliction as the lead characters all seem be hoping for and seeing possibility lead better life than their father and they see chance for such dream come true this chance is uncovered in snow covered field where an airplane has crash landed in the plane three men find the american dream in gym bag affliction too was set in snowy landscape it really seems very simple just hold on the money until spring and if no one claims it they will be safe spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true but the snow melts and so might several of the characters hopes as in return paradise some of the characters are presented chance do the right thing but doing the right thing might not result in better result than something more selfish the movies biggest strength is that it fact makes sense have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized eschewing anything remotely resembling coherent story for example clear and present danger the biggest problem seems overfamiliarization the story the writer perhaps feels that he does not have present scenes that are clear him but the lack of only baffles an audience has not read the book this is definitely not the problem simple plan even though the screenplay is the books author the movie is always clear on where it is going and always makes sense am sue lot was cut but really cannot remember what even minor scene involving man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included the man only comes in on mondays but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many turns out well see the movie one should be warned against seeing the trailer it reveals several scenes from the ending moments yes like in the book it is downer several plot developments and much of the beginning but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer so if you are lucky you will have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie,1.0
