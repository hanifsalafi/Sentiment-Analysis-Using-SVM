your first clue that something is not gonna be quite right the movie you are about see it is heavily christmasthemed and its release date is oh say at the end of february your second clue that something is not gonna be quite right the movie you are about see charlize theron one of the movies dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in when asked if her new movies any good she replies the equivalent of verbal sigh assuring us that yeah it sure is movie all right and there is some scenes like those you would expect find in movie and there is some action and there is other stuff too how immediately grab my attention open your movie five dead guys in santa claus suits then show caption reading six days earlier ya know was honestly interested find out what killed all those poor santas how immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene terminally dull niceguyswhodo notdeservetobeinprison scene write line for the one of prisoners like just want go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball my dad then have ben affleck actually say that line on and forget leave it on the cutting room floor for good measure throw in poorly motivated prison riot and have afflecks best buddy stabbed aw and just two days before his release too already the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours how take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that am contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability think have ben affleck for some reason will never understand pretend he is his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played charlize theron have gary sinise show up and force the two of them participate in poorly planned casino heist the villains big idea kidnap affleck because he used be security guard at the casino force him tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place on paper it seems like the stuff of potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he is looking at the makings for some sort of clever actioncrime thriller it is not like the man is not capable far from it he is the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may he wowed me some the most memorable car chases have ever seen in last years ronin but he is certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers put reindeer games on the shelf of shame his version of the island of dr moreau step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the worlds most generic hero he gets no good oneliners he does not get shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as car thief and wants cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie his name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood see it is called reindeer games get it get it shut up in the past affleck has been at his best as supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing further his viability as leading man step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinises villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook filmmaker could have some up he is dirty and pottymouthed he is got long scruffy hair and goatee and fully expected him walk out of the casino carrying sacks giant dollar signs on them he is also extremely inept at what he does he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts afflecks character pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies him and nearly kills him but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems think he is playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script on side note gary sinise wins this weeks title award as he is the one who gets awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings last weeks winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards how take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely this is bad movie and what is worse is that except for few moments near the notsostunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad if they would done that much at least would have been entertained,0.0

the tagline for this is some houses are just born bad so did not expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs fireplace guarded stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it did not have be bad it is based on great book the haunting of hill house shirley jackson adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as director yet it would not be fair say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it is nothing more than special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply does not engage at first you do not know what is going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that is what got believe hichock once said that it is better wait for climax than see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction boast of and those elements alone are not enough make it good casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid,0.0
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of traveler as anywhere but here there is not one thing about this motherdaughter relationship melodrama that felt honest it relies on contrived minor character tell both mother and daughter what was obvious do in order straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they could not figure it out for themselves if the looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills went over the same ground but was fortunate be more comical and perceptive due alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in they were fortunate have much sharper script work alvin sargents script was weak and annoyingly claustral wayne wangs the joy luck club inept direction made weak script even weaker his inability tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action could not convey pushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her yearold daughter ann natalie portman leave small midwestern burg go crosscountry her beverly hills the daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her be an actress as means of escaping humdrum life the daqughter does not even like the used gold mercedes mother buys drive lala land in and cannot stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio so it becomes question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner adeles dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon does not look that good as she lands job in slum school has her precious car scratched the unruly kids and settles into job she hates in order financially survive daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there during one of many arguments her freespirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only be chased down friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel the cops zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches and then she plans get way from mom using her good grades go brown university instead of ucla during their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high immediately having many high school girlfriends and even high school rich boy admirer t eliot corbin allred reader but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional when she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens be her best friend dies in traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it was not clearly shown why she wants stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants leave so badly the is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams guess what the filmmaker is trying say is that mom is bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself mother has series of setbacks like being dumped her dreamboat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part but mother learns that her daughter has grownup and is independent and that she has stop living her life through her she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what do is about ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing do this of course results in the corny ending showing that moms heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way this was just one of those films where you want be anywhere but in the theater where this is showing,0.0

walt disney studios may have finally met its match the lush animation in twentieth century foxs anastasia but judging the latest efforts from the don bluth studios the visuals are the only thing fox has brag about disneys recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and lesser extent hercules anastasia fox has gone so far as throw all facts completely out the window some may say so what it is just kids movie well if you have young kids beware as they may be noticeably frightened the visuals of corpserotting rasputin zombie whose body parts continually fall off in disconcertingly real way consider yourselves warned nevertheless the animation is quite stunning at times don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout occasionally rivalling photographic quality and yet in other scenes the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd leads me wonder was this rushed market combat disney the plot as anyone who had read history before knows concerns the attempt return anastasia her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in not that anastasia is much concerned what really happened as for the plot go rent disneys candleshoe you will see of anastasia there,0.0
heres something chew on what is the favorite food of big cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of luxury liner in deep rising the obvious answer this question is cardboard because that is the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted computer in fact considering the rigid adherence the expected formulas perhaps it was the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and nonhuman been scattered in all directions we learn some bloody trivia as well such as how sea monster spraypaints in red it drinks human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does halfdigested leftovers suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it does not do much for me on the surface and that is about the only level at this can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection since james cameron directed both in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks wide margin the is not humorous tense or exciting in fact it is downright boring and despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ deep rising feels like the longer movie is it really necessary say anything about the plot probably not since it is easy guess but will go ahead and oblige anyone who wants synopsis the opens introducing us gang of bad guys on board mercenary ship in addition the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics there is finnegan treat williams the boats pilot who is supposed be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin oconnor the inept sidekick who is supposed be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and use that term lightly of the operation their goal attack cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes the problem is the time they reach the argonautica the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste aside from beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and couple of crew members there is no one on board the reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over bad special effect that is supposed resemble an octopus teeth and more than eight tentacles the cast is led treat williams is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistads cinque williams once cannot miss prospect in has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for lead role is like deep rising and his inability create charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career famke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams given her limited acting abilities it is likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes unfortunately bra defeats the purpose of having her in wet teeshirt for half of the picture meanwhile kevin oconnor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching blackboard these days audiences are becoming more difficult impress computergenerated special effects this is lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book needs learn the days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past now moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so wellincorporated that it is impossible tell where they end and where reality begins in deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing unfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced here is not so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although be fair deep rising is particularly bad entry even once this has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it will not be the last of its kind like the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush and that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying,0.0
this is an adaptation of g wells acclaimed novel the invisible man the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue the director is paul verhoven that plus quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough lure us into the theatre the problem is keep us there cannot imagine anyone who would like see this movie second time working on top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret invisibility the first two faces are completed now it is time for the next logical step human caine volunteers for this risky experiment but when he is made invisible something goes wrong while his exgirlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries find something return him normal he learns that invisibility is more of prison than superpower but that is not the bad thing an unexpected sideeffect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania he is naturally given couple of modest superpowers just enough for him survive immolation from flame thrower and an explosion of about quart of nitroglycerine soon every sense of decency is forgotten the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the turns into an alienripoff where caine is walking like half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody though it is based on novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed hollow man that sums up the very nicely this is very silly production laughable actually apparently verhovens imagination does not stretch too far for him the only worthwhile reason become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie being invisible gives you the opportunity be who you are do what you want without being influenced society in many ways it gives you an illusion of having life without consequences the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about all that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man but since this is modernization in other words dehumanization he does not stop there he becomes rapist and then of course murderer you will start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such in the first place shues talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully his face is not seen for the most part of the and the only way he exists is as disembodied voice there are times when his presence actually saves the from being completely embarrassing in the end the effects are the only reason see this in the first place being probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing we observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as body is slowly rendered invisible we see beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing newlypumped blood there are couple of inventive shots smoke fire air and water but are few scenes like that worth attending movie for what is truly disturbing is that great book talented actors and grand budget this could have been so much more pretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary he was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great in way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection it is not better or worse than verhovens average he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues and so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lots of dull action blood and naked bodies he even throws in some of the worst of clich the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off one of the most ridiculous endings of the year you will be screaming nooooo and attempt run towards the exit in slow motion and all we can ask is why the answer is simple though is movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has be about something more than money it has be about telling stories not marketing them it has be about transporting us different place dazzle us magic and cleverness make us care make us think and feel verhoven has obviously missed that point and this is proof of that it is all flesh and bones but no soul void where its imagination should be,0.0

because no one demanded it david duchovny in romantic comedy at last both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources the choice of duchovny may have something do the plot could be fodder for valentines day episode of the xfiles bob rueland david duchovny loses his wife elizabeth joely richardson in car accident at the same time grace briggs minnie driver is in the hospital waiting for heart transplant grace gets elizabeths heart and it leads her bob it is the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets transplant from serial killer and then is driven slaughter people four writers are credited contributing the story that does not seem possible despite being solid two hours long return me adds little the boy meets girl boy loses girl formula and as result is terribly tedious and slowmoving duchovny and driver seem unable generate any sparks and kept wishing for fastforward button move their scenes along since driver has managed work well in romantic roles before blame duchovny he is out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series and have always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on the xfiles comes off more siblinglike than hotandbothered there is something about duchovny that makes me uneasy regardless of the role he is playing he comes off as weirdo the only redeeming quality of return me is its hilarious supporting cast the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker and they generate the only laughs in the movie carroll oconnor is graces grandfather marty oreilly when bob comes into martys restaurant after hours marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status when marty discovers that bob is widower he invites bob join his poker game and introduces him the declaration this is bob his wife is dead the poker buddies are just as desperate find mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news also funny bonnie hunt as graces best friend megan and james belushi as megans husband joe married children megan and joe provide useful counterpoint showing the mundane results of romance although it is rare see him in movie that premieres in theater belushi delivers his lines great comic skill rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bobs best friend and robert loggia as martys brotherinlaw angelo in only the lead actors lived up the standards set the rest of the cast bottom line if you are compelled see this movie watch it on video so you can fastforward scenes carroll oconnor and james belushi,0.0
i am not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but am guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time write second draft seriously this ideaa psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legendsis great one and wish it could have been pulled off the first sign of trouble comes the painfully insipid dialogue an example that car crash must have been awful for everyone involved you can tell that the writer intended that something little more airy was supposed have been said just no one figured out what know in slasher movies there is not supposed be lot of great characterization and myself do not mind cardboard cutouts but please do not let the cutouts be so damn bland one reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters aside from jared leto and joshua jackson who are not on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not mention as dumb as post through of the and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot good thing brad dourif is here but wait he is only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he is just redoing his goodnatured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoos nest brings me another aspect of urban legend it is unoriginality the most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after cravens and williamsons great success urban legend tries deconstruct modernday folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it does not quite succeed it is best stab at selfreflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killertauntinghisvictimonthephone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from female protagonist why villain why why congratulations those of you who answered scream andor urban legend like said this movie could have been great if only silvio had worked or been allowed work little longer on the script still at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and somewhat realized whodunit angle makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than know what you did last summer,0.0

let me begin saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official and even unofficial james bond series it is so full of selfparody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching spoof an omen of what is come is provided the precredits sequence dull affair featuring confrontation between man it is difficult give better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie and the assassin of the title song woefully terrible lyrics follows and the rest of the movie is even worse the plot might have been pleasant change from the usual ruletheworld so often found in the james bond movies of the but here we get confused mismash about fabled assassin francisco scaramanga christopher lee putting in performance is one of the rare saving graces of this movie who someone has apparently payed one million dollars in order remove roger moores there is also flimsy connection the energy crisis and missing solar cell efficiency it is as much of mess as it sounds bond is helped in his task mary goodnight ekland whose character could not possibly be any closer the stereotypical bimbo during the course of the movie she gets locked in both closet and car trunk blunders around control room accidentally setting off laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever maud adams later star in octopussy is much more stronger and useful character but she hardly features in the movie scaramangas lackey is dwarf called niknak who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in not counting ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists another misguided attempt at humour the solitary car chase might have been highlight but the action is interrupted on frequent basis redneck sheriff w pepper played clifton james of live and let die fame yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window he is easily the most irritating character in james bond movie even his presence could have been made bearable one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history degree twisting loop jump over broken bridge could have been except somebody got the idea dub mocking whistle tone over the final print on top of that debacle the whole end of the is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramangas funhouse the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had make the next in the series the infinitely superior the spy who loved me great in order for the bond franchise survive,0.0
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for steven spielberg drama schindlers list and directed intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career what does not make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project is both dull and completely ineffective the involves small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story be emotionallycharged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us nothing more than poorlydone courtroom drama based on book jonathan hart was consequently based on true account civil action is set in in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their childrens death from leukemia due unknown causes jan originally decides drop the case but when he stumbles across corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake thus goes into the citys drinking water suddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins care for them and becomes determined get the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned his staff accountant william macy that no money is coming in them only going out also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his million offer settle the case coming from such talented writer director and cast not mention one of the most interesting composers danny elfman civil action is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts be relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude an absence of magnetism and even meaning watching the could not help but notice its similarities far far superior the sweet hereafter dealt lawyer played brilliantly ian holm investigating school bus accident that killed number of children in his attempts find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger teenage girl starts remind him of his own teenage daughter young drugaddict who has run away from home not only was the plotting similar civil action but it also had the same exact running time of minutes considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holms character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl in civil action however have no idea where the running time went since the is virtually two hours of nothingness we do not get know the parents very well nor any of the main characters through its whole duration did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travoltas lawyer character jan schlictmann who does not appear have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job every scene is tediously related directly the premise and therefore there was no one for me care about or root for you have got work pretty hard actually not get an audience become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what civil action does be honest would be fairly hardpressed state an aspect of the that actually liked aside from one flashback when mans young son died on the way the doctor remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering could say the performances were good but who is fooling who since every character is onedimensionally written no ones acting abilities are challenged in any way travolta plays lawyer well enough but that is about all he does duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing give oneliners at every chance he gets and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the pictures final scene as judge she appears unbilled since it is just cameo but why did she even agree do it in the first place finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began role the left me another question what was the point abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that begin civil action seemed me at least be an example of how not make courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice the very serious subject matter the deals,0.0
synopsis al simmons topnotch assasin guilty conscience dies in fiery explosion and goes hell making pact malebolgia chief demon there simmons returns earth years later reborn as spawn general in hells army donning necroplasmic costume replete knives chains and morphing cape sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawns attention comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made name for himself as firstrate comic book penciller on the spiderman titles join the newlyformed creatorowned image comics new comic book legend was born spawn mcfarlanes spawn immediately became commercial and critical success and defining comic book series of the mcfarlane created hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane utilize his knack for artistic detail the max the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros batman franchise movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn in the summer of hence new line cinema released spawn liveaction based on the groundbreaking series this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed how much spawn misses the mark what happened why is spawn so bad todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in cameo do not think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the place the blame in part on the recent trend fueled public demand apparently for special effects blowout movies utilizing the latest computer technology these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated morphing characters and filled unnecessary pyrotechnics hardly minute goes in this without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid do not get me wrong but because the script and cast are not engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath spawns translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level mcfarlanes spawn was tortured hero mercenary trade al simmons was nonetheless warm man in love the beautiful wanda having died and journeyed hell he made pact return earth be wanda simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married despite his sometimes violent nature readers could not help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld spawn attempts show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should do so when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote supervirus called heat he wishes unleash enslave the world do not help matters spawn in an apparent attempt duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman john leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films seems make him perfect candidate for the violator the however spends so much time on the violators offensive antics that they grate on the nerves apparently meant be the comic relief in the as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted the sullen spawn the violators lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave leguizamo does satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the michael jai white relative newcomer theatrical releases seems be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on more time needed be spent on whites character before he became spawn for the movie pull at the heartstrings special note should be made about martin sheen as the overthetop obnoxious evil general wynn easily the hammiest performance in the movie it is hard imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now sheens excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as mastermind villain and comes as surprise considering his extensive career in many other elements conspire the disappointing script and abundant special effects drag spawn down mtvstyle jerky inyourface editing is one of them flames for example roll across the screen sometimes announce shift in setting cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as poor narrator for the he goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawns humanity is left remains be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads another the music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue loud and obnoxious hard rock fused drum loops dominate some scenes be fair however marilyn mansons long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawns return earth while filter and the crystal methods cannot you trip like do proves surprisingly fitting theme song for as good comic book as it is spawn did not spawn good movie spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development it receives two stars for its technically welldone special effects many other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better rated pg spawn seems more violent than many rrated movies and probably would not be appropriate for the very young,0.0
i cannot recall previous experience where the fairly good time was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota for forty minutes or so was lured into loopy if occasionally overwrought romantic comedy and was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt then rather suddenly was clubbed over the head nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter was whacked in the gut another feeling minnesota is that made me feel violated as though had trusted writerdirector steven baigelman bring me cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face feeling minnesota tells the story of topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him reds punishment is force freddie marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent donofrio who is far from the man of freddies dreams enter jjaks keanu reeves sams estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time catch freddies eye and have sex her in the bathroom united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam is not ready let them go without fight freddie meanwhile is not ready let sams money go without fight and thus begins series of violent confrontations there is both style and substance the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens an effective montage showing jjaks and sams intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away live his father it does great job of setting up jjaks unstable life life has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks the wedding sequence includes number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in simple question is given very funny spin most important baigelman begins establish the connection between freddie and jjaks humor and economy as in scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along the replacements will dare on the car radio you would have every reason expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota unfortunately you would be dead wrong suppose should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in red threatens freddie as she tries avoid the wedding but certainly did not expect what got what got was yet another in long line of recent films trying ride the tarantino wave mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality suddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes story about corpse and everything had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency the characterizations vincent donofrio turns in manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the screaming and covered in blood there are films have managed employ radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come mind but they did not try draw an audience the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment do not want dismiss baigelmans successes out of hand he gets fun performance out of dan aykroyd as crooked cop and some wellcrafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen promote feeling minnesota as lighthearted caper it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he cannot make his two halves into whole feeling minnesota left me feeling used and there is not much funny about that,0.0

a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto russian science vessel well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming decent and original movie and simply becomes predictable scifi thriller anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then hapless crew on tug discovers the derelict ship and tries salvage it no more needs be said as what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable the story is full of very shallow characters that do not do much other than subsist the captain of the tug played donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as how he has survived long enough reach his age looks be in his add this we are shown this motley crew that at times seems be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one wonder what they are doing on tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in typhoon no less none of the characters seem work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along the special effects the waves that are generated be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in tub and someone is simply creating waves it looks genuinely fake granted trying recreate typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in style similar the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish also on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem move extremely slowly why if this life form that is so advanced as be able create these robotics should it not be able create them move faster regardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the rather than add it as the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing complain about the actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe watching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed be something happening so if you are going into this movie not expecting see anything grand and are only going kill some time and watch mediocre scifi thriller then you will not be too disappointed as the movie is but the latest in genre that was originally created aliens it does little more than try cash in on that aspect this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised simply wait for one of the major networks air it on tv,0.0
this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name before this the game had few spinoff cartoons were ok but the idea of doing movie is insane it should have been animated if it should have been done at all instead the people do the best they can talented cast yet it still fails the plot is completely different from the games plot am not complaining about that the story involves the mario bros having plumbing business in brooklyn and having compete rival company eventually they find construction site their nemesis happens be enviromentally unsafe so due luigis john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy they go and investigate they get transported blade runneresque world lead king koopa dennis hopper somehow plot dealing all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in the plot is fine better than the movie deserves the acting is ok this seems be more of visual the special effects are good especially on the robotic yoshi however the drags and is no fun and it leaves itself open sequel probably will not ever be made this movie begins sort of promising but ends up leaving weird taste in your mouth so if you want watch sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper then watch super mario bros the movie you could do worse but you could definitely do better street fighter the movie starring raul julia and jean claude vandamme this movie was based off of series of never ending sequels game called street fighter it has all the characters from the game in reasonable plot it is more like movie than it should be yes it is watchable raul julia does good job considering this was his final while the game had nonstop fighting sequences this movie is hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying show off plot at the same time does it work sort of the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run bison raul julia guile jean claude vandamme takes his troops attack bisons main base in an attempt liberate the innocent villages he has taken over in short amount of time the movie introduces several characters well it catches your attention but it ultimately seems like showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like there is chun li or look at that fireball ryu did at vega it hits the bases presenting the characters in plot good sets but goes no further this movie needed more action in the first place the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting if you like lighthearted action flicks or if you liked the game watch this one it is even worth watching if you want see raul julias last performance or if you cannot get enough of van damme other than that you could find better action flicks,0.0

in the past tim burton has taken cinema storm the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just do not cut it sleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is terrible mess for those who remember disneys fantastic adventures of ichabod crane it is actually superior this disneys version was at least interesting while burtons drags on far too long without any suspense or frights while the stories are similar the new version adds too much the once likable story and throws in some weak dialogue top it off ichabod crane johnny depp is now apparently constable who was sent new york investigate suspicious murders the victims are headless and no traces of evidence were found until the murderer reveals himself hence the headless horseman now the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy they must stop the headless horseman from killing spree that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster in the original the headless horseman was meant be unstoppable no one could stop him not even ichabod the end of the it had audiences in deep thought burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere and how make the main characters heroes he takes no risk what so ever and this is where he fails another pathetic element of the was the script like said earlier he just stuffed too much in at one time and made it look real sloppy kind of like the mess the headless horseman made his victims he completely butchered the story pieces thankfully there are few factors that particularly liked the acting depp was quite notable he took the nerdy character of the cartoon and simply acted it out in better manner if it was not for his quirky oneliners doubt could have remained awake because quite frankly was getting sleepy just when thought christina ricci was getting be good actress she winds up doing this it just goes show no actress or actor can pass up big blockbuster it is too tempting let go even if the script is mush the atmosphere too was quite involving should have just gazed at the sets and the eerie fog rather than actually pay attention what was going on at least burtons films are eye candy even if they are trash the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads and the fight between the horseman depp and casper van dien other than that wish could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the and just sit back and stare at the scenery the end can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed this is the biggest disappointment of the year especially when such talented director like burton handles project like this do not waste your time or money because your head will feel hollow,0.0
plot rich psychiatrist great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped some bad guys who want him extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients of course the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has few hours comply their demands before they kill his daughter pretty good premise no critique if you are not fan of movies packed plot holes inconsistencies and yes even more plot holes heed my words and skip this hollow thriller and do not like saying that either since this actually had some potential and started off pretty well sure the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom primal fear and nick of time pureed into one but the whole psychiatrist working against the clock thing actually had me engaged at first but it is at about the halfway mark of this movie that the bottom drops out and all that we are left are lot of questions and very few plausible answers we get the overly smart kid who manages pull one over on the bad guys we get weak woman her leg in cast beating the crap out of tough bad guy we get douglas character new york uppedity psychiatrist suddenly turning into an action hero moves and attitude boot and what about the films main plot point why would the bad guys still give crap about this thing after years and even more so why would they only give the shrink until the days end do his part you waited years what is another few days or why not set up another heist instead will tell you why it is because we would not have bad movie otherwise that is why and many many more ugh whatever the case it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphys character from the mental home and how come she went him so nicely thought she did not trust him that turned my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into joke and few bogus chase and action sequences later we were left longwinded ending that did little answer any other questions might have still had and actually brought up even more contradictions badly put together this movie features some decent acting some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise but loses it all in haze of plot miscues ultimately leave you little care for anyone in fact if it was not for brittany murphys excellent portrayal of traumatized teen jennifer espositos embarrassing performance as police woman yeah right watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick but it was not supposed be and michael douglas cool regular guy part there would be little reason remain seated until the end of this picture incidentally can anyone please give me one good reason why espositos character was in this movie in the first place she was completely superfluous and on top of all that the end of this flick the director seems have realized how dumb the audience must be have bought most of the garbage that he would been shoveling out for the hour and half prior and decides add insult injury flashing back an earlier characters death when one of the bad guys dies just so we know as an audience that the two are interrelated somehow ooooh thanks mr fleder appreciate the spoonfeeding dude yum yum but how about explaining every other plot point in your that made no sense whatever either way do not give rats ass because this movie is dog and that is unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it see it if you like dumb thrillers incidentally if you appreciated along came spider you will likely enjoy this as well they both start off interesting premises only toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through where is joblo coming from along came spider girl interrupted kiss the girls primal fear seven,0.0
i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world and wish that filmmakers would use commandments as blueprint on how _not_ do it writerdirector daniel taplitz has created bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn man of faith who runs into streak of bad luck usually inspires countrywestern lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled bolt of lightning convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides break his and sets out turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into thou shalt and vice versa his wifes sister rachel friends courteney cox wants help seth rachels selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends break few commandments of his own thinks seth is lunatic thus begins picks the wrong tone for every occasion taplitz is not interested in treating seths tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible sympathize him composer joseph vitarelli provides score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought one through five dispatched in fiveminute montage the result is character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of highconcept movie plot it is not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth corporate attorney rachel is given case is supposed soften hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seths false witness only courteney cox strikes note of reality in solid performance she is sane center around too equally troubled men revolve even she cannot force taplitz decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing the struggles in our lives and our relationship the infinite the time seth makes singularly biblical reappearance late in the it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for fantastical fable makes no connection real human experience commandments is bad comedy could have been decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously,0.0

the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see wading through this gooey detestable sludge is quite the chore for even dedicated romantic those hoping find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris odonnell vehicle should wander elsewhere the bachelor is painfully clumsy mess strung together few brief moments of surprising poignancy awaiting these moments enduring the rest of the is certainly not worth your time or money although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical prettyboy cocoon chris odonnell has an effortless charm as an actor most will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile can odonnell carry the weight of on his shoulders perhaps if he found the proper vehicle but the bachelor falls far short of the requirements the actor just cannot register such pathetic screenplay as the guiding light success few instances of adorable humor aside it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is the bachelor odonnell plays jimmie hopeless romantic in his late twenties who is progressing in serious relationship anne renee zellweger jimmie takes anne out for dinner the restaurant specifically used for proposals and attempts ask for her hand in marriage the problem is that his proposal sucks big time you can tell things are not going pleasantly because jimmie gets the infamous deerintheheadlights look when anne questions his approach and then the plot along the stupidity of the movie thickens jimmies grandfather peter ustinov dies suddenly leaving video will behind for his grandson who also happens be his only living relative everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of million dollars jimmie of course there is catch he must get married before his th birthday stay joined his bride for an entire decade and produce healthy children within the first five years the bad news is that jimmies birthday is the following day anne out of town he must find willing bride share his riches and within very limited time frame there are certainly few worthwhile aspects of the bachelor for one the movies approach is interesting and not dripping clich another is the colorful cast odonnell and zellweger are cute together and the supporting cast tries relentlessly rescue the from drowning in it is own mediocrity ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure and james cromwell is sincere and effective as wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures and now the cons the approach may be interesting but in trying an oldfashioned method director gary sinyor gives the synthetic feel the characters are drawn obvious broad strokes and the plot is bogged down everything humanly imaginable yes the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute the screenplay is lamely written and the subject matter poorly conceived the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted along whatever promise the initially contained potential goes out the window early suit sinyors colorful approach but not minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed the directors wishes the bachelor becomes lost without homing beacon save it you have seen the tv spots have not you odonnell is madly rushing down deserted street and the caption reads what is this man running from in actuality he is fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want marry him and inherit his fortune it is one of the few enjoyable sequences in the after seeing the movie believe that the approaching horde could be something else odonnell could be running from his angry fans who have just endured the bachelor and are hunting him down for revenge,0.0
topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that mentioned in the devils advocate movies that have brilliant beginning but do not know how end it begins introducing us selection of characters who all know each other there is liz who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment prue who is getting married geoff lizs boyfriend neil her previous boyfriend ant who has written screenplay for the first hour we get know these people through everyday activities as they talk on the phone go out dinner hang clothes on the line the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the filmmakers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst them at times the events border on the ridiculous like the screening of the but they still seem in keeping the characters and their lives this does not sound like brilliant premise for we just follow lot of people around who are vaguely related but it is the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing unfortunately this level of honesty is not maintained about half an hour go sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama such disappointment after such brilliant start the actors are all quite good ms danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive the energy of her character is palpable and is major reason the movie is so watchable lot of the performances are bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such shock up till that point was transported this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility it is unlikely in way that is jarring someone caught up in the world of the not just the events but also the tone of some of the end is wrong clashing strongly the sense of fun that has preceded it this is not say that topless women talk about their lives is not good as stated above the first hour is superb and even the end is above average it just takes turn means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss,0.0

there is rule when it comes movies sequel is never as good as the original there are very few exceptions this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was really bad movie and that this is not even the first sequel it you have recipe for very painful viewing experience do not be fooled the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey time kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire they made this movie before they were stars judging their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons it is wonder they ever worked in again after appearing in this turkey apparently the producers of this realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day and do not blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them unfortunately for them it is horror in zellweger plays your typically stupid horror character while mcconaughey plays guy who wears mechanical brace on his leg that he controls television remote control hey do not say did not warn you make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become full blown crossdresser and spends the entire movie in drag there is plot this movie but it is not worth mentioning let us just suffice say that group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving halfwitted sidekick man cannot get over just how bad this movie is this has absolutely no redeeming qualities even the obligatory topless babe shot was not enough hold my interest for more than seconds the writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison the acting this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected this they would never break the law again,0.0
as hotshot defense attorney kevin lomax keanu reeves has special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients he is also an excellent judge of character knowing just strings pull sway the jury while breaking down potentially damaging witnesss testimony and on top of that he is damn good trial lawyer in the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it does not hamper lomaxs desire creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt thereby getting an acquittal his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country headed john milton al pacino he is brought their headquarters in nyc where he immediately impresses milton and is subsequently offered fulltime position as head of their newlycreated criminal law division lomax is soon given the case of his life he must defend real estate tycoon who has been charged triple homicide the draw of fame and his desire prove just how good he really is begins isolate him in his own hell he works late defends the guilty pledges his soul his firm and begins neglect his smart but fretful wife mary ann charlize theron but what starts off as promising john grishamlike story about consciencestricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin tinker the story it begins like typical parable where smalltown boy makes it big but then has balance his sense of self against the allure of money power and greed but milton is far more than just corrupt partner of the firm quite literally he is the devil in disguise and as the movie progresses he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago freaky and frightening things begin happen and after much of the has elasped miltons horrifying intent is finally revealed the movie tries give us two separate and distinct acts the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as bigcity trial lawyer the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax unfortunately the two never mix well into cohesive story and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation tie them together and an impressive production piece give it an underlying atmosphere granted the is very handsomelooking you will enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes life during heated speech given pacino you will also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties you will also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in mary ann knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away this was one of the better storylines but unfortunately is only subplot as all things involving the devil you can expect nothing but the worst in the first few scenes reeves anchors the but then slowly drifts into the background his path from selfvanity selfconsciousness is never fully explored his actions seem arbitrary and his reasons for them not fully known pacinos comical portrayal is spirited but the vanity of his character begins shift the focus of the movie there is another plot or two that is introduced but never gets revisited the focus seemed inconsistent throughout and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap this movie tries be horrifying thrilling and dramatic all at the same time however while the devils advocate strives get noticed ultimately it makes very little impression at all,0.0
i am not sure should be writing review of the witches of eastwick because am not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it however can express the most important observation made of it e did not like it if had summarize this think would conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls old scratch and how they try get out of the deal that is the kernel of it anyway tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship unfortunately little or no effort is ever made follow up and elucidate on these concepts they are simply thrown out and then left rot while the goes on apace actually think that most of the audience was even more confused than was they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of ghostbusters and were bit confused be getting folk tale philosophical overtones they laughed or tried laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the away from it is rather frightening direction three women cher susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer live in eastwick small midwestern town one night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man drop into their lives in seeming answer their idle daydreams wealthy eccentric moves into mansion on the hill and seduces each one attempting be everything they want him be he soon shows evidence of mysticalperhaps demonicpower and his devotion the womens merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones even worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him anyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially sarandons character we never get inside them never feel sympathetic them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland as for nicholson well even the devil needs direction go in and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie due the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly nicholsons acting he still cannot be yanked in one direction and then another without making him little vague and then there is the special effects not in themselvesthey were not that goodbut their overuse was almost positive until saw the credits that the witches of eastwick was either produced alexander salkind who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or stephen spielberg after the th vomit scene and the nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt nope it is another bunch of guys and directed george miller who has shown great skill stuntsspecial effects before the road warrior nightmare at feet episode of twilight zone the movie but apparently does not know when turn off the wind machine and let his people act fgawds sake guys this is jack nicholson let him loose let him grin demonically skip the splitting earth and fake lightning watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car the voodoo doll all could think of was what waste if you are going use slapstick like that use it up on pee wee herman nicholson does what he can the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems bit stiff as if he is not sure what he should be doing next and no wonder this script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that it would just love be allegory but it is not sure about what maybe if you give it time it will think of something so what is the witches of eastwick horror movie folk tale comedy statement about women an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality tend think of the image that seems dominate the movie for me watching someone regurgitate halfdigested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience in other words mess if you like nicholson enough watch him here maybe of his charm is able make it through the logjams of others,0.0
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the does not refer the clunky robotic animals that try kill our heroes alas it refers our heroes as it turns out the alien race that sends computer virus earth via the mir space station thinks of the human race as virus perhaps even cancer that needs be eradicated before it spreads any further after all we have taken up this entire planet and if they let us live for another billion years or so we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one but the human race does not have much worry about after all there is woman named foster jamie lee curtis out there stopping the computer virus she is the chief navigator on sea vessel travelling her is captain everton donald sutherland steve baker william baldwin woods marshall bell squeaky julio oscar mechoso and richie sherman augustus they are all sailing in typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters lucky for us we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board the evil captain everton thinks he is going take the ship in and get reward he convinces his crew that there is going be big money so they try salvage the ship soon however when it is apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power they realize that something bad must have happened finally they meet nadia joanna pacula who explains their situation computer virus has taken over the ship it is creating biomechanical lifeforms eliminate the human race virus is truly dumb action thriller one of negligible intelligence and innovation when considering the entire you will realize that it lacks single original scene it is direct ripoff of nearly every james cameron aliens the abyss and the terminator films are the most plagiarized more importantly it is basically the same movie as last years deep rising liked deep rising simply because it is funny it knows it is silly and derivative virus takes itself seriously and in the most serious manner possible it steals from every good and bad of the genre showing you countless familiar scenes and sporting cookiecutter plot that any of the scifihorror genre could fit little trimming but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out okay let me get this straight the alien race is never really explained is basically sentient electricity they need make themselves physical so they use space station get onto ship is surrounded water but who cares about that on the ship they make bunch of clunky immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people after that they start using the dead people create halfhuman halfmachine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around the leader of course is big creature every like this has big creature at the end but the big creature in virus is so big that it has tear down the walls move around virus is indeed cliched but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just is not very threatening it is established that they can simply turn off the power stop it but the virus has sealed the power room the time our heroes get there on one level virus is almost passable fun it is really gory and few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal the director john bruno worked on lot of camerons films there is also nice array of actors even though none of them do any acting except for donald sutherland who does lot of very bad acting the bottom line however is this virus is bad movie it rips off lot of good movies that are worth seeing in that order recommend that you rent any one of the alien films simply admire the qualities of creature that actually threatens our heroes,0.0

depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal but in case you did not know this do not bother remembering it the words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it the closest the even gets catholicism is in its narrative the story is told angelina jolie her priest while on death row in cuba circa regardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness boy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around searching for wife since this is century ago we narrowly dodge remake of green card only find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful skipping few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get see angelina jolies breasts again the girl turns out be con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills original sin then briefly tries be thriller we see boy go whorechasing saying he wants find girl and kill her but as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the degenerates into the worst dissection of the virginwhore complex since milk money girl toys the idea of reforming her congirl past all the while avoiding the other man lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place add insult injury some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the is either in slow motion or uses strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of b gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running make my bottom ten of the year do not even bother original sin but if you do go be honest yourself and admit its pure sex appeal just keep in mind that although this may not be the most original on the block it is much worse than sin this is sacrilege,0.0

adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue make load of money really goes show the sad state of cinema today while good comedies like rushmore choose recent example gets limited release and does not make lot of money big daddy got huge release and has made lot of cash it is also nothing special and does not deserve the money it is making but digress sandler plays sonny koufax unemployed new yorker seemingly low mental age his girlfriend makes ultimatum him either wise up and get responsible or she is leaving him strange set of events koufax ends up julian played twins cole and dylan sprouse five year old kid after failed attempt impress his girlfriend the child koufax decides he wants keep the child however social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax is not the real father and wants take julian back koufax along his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight keep the child big daddy really is not that good many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant find julian and sonny peeing against wall be funny there is the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour the after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad hideous the court scene at the end of the is useless and unbelievable and not helped the soppy overacting it is poor attempt win over the audience adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer joey lauren adams is much much better and deserves far better than this trash steve buscemi pops up in funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny rob schneider is also funny as crazy delivery man the two twins who play julian are k they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the where the tear juice is turned up high big daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for few chuckles although it is actually well put together nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism cannot help the fact that the script and characters are trash big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and that is about it,0.0

any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it unfortunately this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible directed brian depalma the first problem is that this has absolutely no connection the tv show whatsoever aside from the music the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork orchestrated jim phelps allowed them counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world teamwork was the key this is set up as cross between james bond and depalmas blow out where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions it was travoltas vulnerability that made that so exciting and claustrophobic in this tom cruise is basically omniscient believe that and so there is no fun going on here whatsoever the story is about as contrived as contrived gets and is full of holes there are basically two memorable sequences one involves breaking into kubrickesque computer room task that could have been made much easier had the characters whit of common sense suffice it say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room the second involves highspeed train helicopter and the chunnel and does not have be seen be disbelieved the actors are all miscast especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife who cannot act and ving rhames as computer hacker who looks lost and embarrased be in this movie tom cruise is no james bond and jon voight looks more like bobby the brain heenan than jim phelps brian depalmas career has been bafflingly erratic at his best he beats hitchcock at his own game blow out carrie body double but this is not his best the screenplay was partly written robert towne who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in chinatown but this script is perfunctory at best and terrrible at worst the cinematography has comic book redblue emphasis is nice look at but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time think of an escape trick please do not spend your money on this it will only encourage make more,0.0
movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros have never generated much interest at the box office but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in it did surprisingly well simple story pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy it got my vote for the movie where expected the least and got the most and if you have not had the opportunity would definitely recommend that you see it on video in the world of mortal kombat based on the popular arcade game dark forces from outworld try infiltrate earths realm the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity the mortal kombat refers competition fought human mortals against outworlds minions if won will guarantee earths safety for another generation mk picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition despite their victory however gateway has somehow opened and outworld continues in its quest conquer earth outworlds warriors include an impressive collection of fighters including shao kahn mintoro centaur sheeva fourarmed ogre and sindel earths mortal warriors under the leadership of the benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade and jax who must fight against outworlds forces it is an easy enough premise but unfortunately very unfortunately the writers try do too much the movie it is only video game after all but the onscreen version tries go beyond it is comic book boundaries adding depth conceptualization of selfworth and worst of all love story this becomes very awkward because all of the players are fighters and nothing more they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required actually act this becomes embarrassingly apparent for example as the movie tries develop romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best they spoke little but fought lot thus the movie was easy digest however mk tries give these players certain amount of depth an element that was lacking in the first movie but the attempt here fails miserably this uneasy feeling is readily apparent for example whenever you hear lord rayden speak not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic g useless advice but he speaks so slowly as if simulate infinite wisdom try reading this half as fast and you will hear what mean but the movie is not complete fatality fight scenes are wellchoreographed highlighted terrific acrobatics and agility and players of the game will be rewarded the inclusion of practically every character from the video game although their screen time amounts nothing more than cameo even if you are not familiar the video game each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry easily differentiate themselves but it is just too little of what moviegoers and especially fans of the game will expect oddly the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence and the poor acting results in muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival am now talking very slowly as if simulate infinite wisdom rent the first one but the sequel is for kombat fans only,0.0

the happy bastards quick movie review wild wild west better name for this movie might have been wild wild waste warner bros in an attempt get their own men in black style of movie had managed lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mibs success in order get their own fourth of july blockbuster contemporary bigscreen update the classic westernscifi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad but somehow they ran into problem along the way they were so busy trying fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would have made all the difference story writer wild wild wests story and script was compiled six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon if warner bros had gotten him the movie would have possibly been five times better than what it is heck ten times as is however the story and screenplay is mess filled dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes make even will cringe as he is performing them and complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well heres the story us army member james west will smith teams up creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline take on ruthless villain the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him roll around in steamcontrolled wheelchair they catch onto plot of his involving superweapon that can basically be considered an foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path as said the way the script unfolds is complete mess but the acting does not help either kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing display even smidgeon of care as he did in the western silverado smith seems be having better time as west although he is not nearly as charming as he was in mib branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps the point where we cannot even stand look at him or his strange beard and salma hayek is along for the ride search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention her acting is barely passable but what breath of fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld is not of great help either even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost it is as if he feels he is directing tv movie big nono when you are helming what is supposed be bigscreen hit last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages land three cars ahead on the train while it is still in motion also he seems be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed the likes of such folks last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he is not kissing woman as he is looking through peephole at the enemy the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects the huge mechanical spider is technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable the creativity of the show there is also good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again logic question comes into play regarding their polarity would say sit back and have good time wild wild west but it really is not possible if the racist and sex jokes do not bother you the performances will if the performances do not bother you the story will if the story does not bother you the racist and sex jokes will there is no end the vicious circle go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats you will have better time if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in role as president grant bet he wishes he were somewhere else,0.0
old soldiers never die they just turn into cliches soldier review michael redman copyright michael redman the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult exist in the same body jungian archetypes these two opposites need each other create whole but it is difficult integrate both often we will encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and the help of jungs magician sit around imagining grand schemes without the drive manifest their plans much less the wisdom recognize the darkness all they have are dreams warriors on the other hand are ready go war at the drop of hat and will do combat every last bit of their energy they do not care enough about anything know what is worth fighting for gladiators who live only for the battle this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know but can also illustrate societies america during the late sixties was conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers todd kurt russell is living breathing archetype chosen from birth as soldier he is raised the government be killing machine his childhood is cruelty and competition he is indoctrinated the big rules never question authority winning is everything strength beats knowledge veteran of numerous intergalactic wars todd is and he is obsolete new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger left for dead after test battle the best of the new killers caine jason scott lee he is unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia garbage world obviously our hero is still alive he finds group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back health when the peaceloving colonists get good look at who todd is they are afraid of him and he is exiled live himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world they are the other good guys these lovers find that they need warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world conduct exercises for their improved human weapons todd finds himself in the role of protector what could have been fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultraright wing future is ruined turning the into cartoon the effects are mostly secondrate explosions or jerky slow motion the plot is old hat we do not get even glimpse at the society that created the soldiers hardly anything makes sense the films science fares badly all the remarkable advances we have made in just years the takes place in we are still stupid after conquering the stars for some reason we use vast amounts of energy load up huge space ships rubbish tote it landfill light years away even stranger the garbage barges appear double as time machines virtually all the trash is vintage there is nothing in the story that is not predictable the first thing that todd sees after coming back life is sandra connie nielsen the woman just little too beautiful be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him it does not take genius foresee that her husband is not going be around much longer is it shock find out that the films climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine who would you guess wins some of the scenes would work if this were comedy todds first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connies nipple poking through her thin blouse later as he sits his lonely campfire tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion supposedly this clich is not meant be humorous dastardly col mekum jason isaacs pencilthin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash responsible for last years quirky and visually enticing but problematic the fifth element director paul anderson sees the as shane in outer space maybe if shane were played sylvester stallone in rambo mode the movie does not even work as an action there is never question as the outcome somehow the new superior soldiers do not prove much of match for todd the acting is not anything write home about nielsen almost comes across as real person but is soon relegated background victim russell is buffedup and does credible job but it is not much of challenge uttering around words during the mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space gary busey as todds commanding officer is completely wasted in his lowkey role everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool sometimes the sets are impressive unfortunately occasionally and sometimes do not make most disappointing is that the screenplay is david webb peoples who wrote blade runner possibly the best science fiction movie ever made sharpeyed viewers will notice few obscure references that peoples says that this is not blade runner sequel but sidequel that takes place in the same universe although that may have been the intent in his original script the result is more like bad television series that the blade runner replicants watch pass time perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining michael redman has written

what is this homicide or bad bmovie that is the prophetic question asked one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie let me clear things up for you cupcake this is not bad bmovie it is really bad bmovie so bad it is almost good almost but not quite the movie starts off in the space aliens sending botched experiment down earth it is bunch of sluglike creatures that kill people and take over their bodies the slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger anybody that is until two loser university students unfreeze him in he and the slugs inside him promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more coeds into slug zombies slightly crazed cop tom atkins and the requisite girl the face of an angel jill whitlow join these two geeky university students jason lively and steve marshall do battle the slugs it more or less falls on the four of them make the world safe again from the evil slugs the acting is bad capital the story is worse and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in home movie the only saving grace was the requisite titshot courtesy of jill whitlow it had absolutely nothing do the story but liked it actually it was the high point of the movie for me of course that is not really saying much the story moves around in hap hazard fashion gives it leg up on some other horror films unlike most movies of this genre there actually is story not great one but it is there this is one in long line of movies from the that were thrown together capitalize off the success of the friday the th halloween and nightmare on elm street movies you could randomly select movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better but night of the creeps might make nice addition bmovie horror marathon just do not be too upset if you cannot find it you really will not be missing that much,0.0

the summer of was not very good one for devout cinephiles it offered no blair witches or sixth senses the best big budget could do was an efficient xmen adaptation and flawed but entertaining shaft update nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of potentially brighter fall movie season that batterycharging at least for critics who have sit through every piece shit that moseys into multiplexes time of year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season it is also indie director neil labutes first attempt at something resembling mainstream picture and am sad report it is resounding failure at least on this web site mess that is as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labutes previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic went in expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised it is screenplay even winning an award at cannes but exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment are critics so desperate for something unique that they are blind how derivative the particular brand of uniqueness betty dolls out is for the first time labute is working from script he has not written and he seems unsure of how handle the material betty tries be hip like pulp fiction this is another flick featuring pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard of oz of this makes several allusions and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie but the end it left me cold its calculated desperation it is labutes half hearted attempt make crowd pleaser and he does not even seem have half that heart in it nurse betty concerns soap opera addict betty brilliantly played renee zellweger who witnesses the killing of her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of mad housewife two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock she happens have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities she is blocked out her husbands death and thinks she is character in her favorite soap reason love betty sets out on the road la some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend dr david ravell greg kinnear while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men slipped bit but not much his sophomore effort your friends and neighbors then fell straight on his ass bash play he penned that was recently aired on showtime the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist only labutes persistence in wallowing in the horrid things average people do each other usually out realizing how horrid they themselves are in the play paul rudd as an obnoxious jock delivers monologue detailing how he once followed gay man into bathroom and beat him maybe death while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim boys will be boys another character schlubby businessman reacts the loss of his job actually killing his own baby what was once so powerful about labutes work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements we all have in us amplified disgusting degree had become so over the top it was borderline comic obviously at this point labute could use dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty is not it he clearly has little passion for what he is doing here instead replacing his mojo strained quirks one of the hit men is huge soap fan and the character of betty would be little more than one joke gimmick if zelllweger had not managed transcend that tailor made appeal the widest possible audience nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down as the two are made enact softboiled tarantinoesque dialogue they evince little chemistry rock constantly in over the top rant mode acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling hit man an occupation that is represented far too frequently in movies nowadays think rock is great comic yet he has not been able bring his feral intelligence movies whenever he acts and no matter the part it is like he is doing the damn chris rock show surprisingly at least considering her work in me myself and irene renee zellweger gives revelatory performance building on her baby faced apple pie looks that wideopen face and helium voiced earnestness suggests little girl not fully grown into her thirtyyearold body it is the best work she is ever done freeman is effective as always though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds where the movie wants take it the actor plays the role in his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries insinuate symbolic kinship between his character and bettys suggesting that both are controlled their fantasies rather than reality that is interesting but the movie does not do anything it other than crash land the subtheme into labored speech in the midst of badly staged gun battle the has good moments many of the scenes involving very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation zellweger an almost soothing lyrical score and you know movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it but nothing jells it is parts good or bad are so disparate as be opposing the might have worked had it settled on being one type of mainstream female forrest gump or an oddball art but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke bettys screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence without betty would not make any progress in the nurse betty is driven coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes nurse in the job that she takes in order get closer her imaginary lover she happens be at the hospital at the exact moment that drive shooting takes place and miraculously knows how take care of the victims wound because she happened see how on tv leads her being offered room the victims girlfriend who eventually gets betty into party where she meets kinnear little too tidy do notcha think betty has an interesting theme though it does not even seem aware of this the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother more on the way this is about women so deluded as think that her favorite soap opera is reality ironically reallife survivor sean kennif has taken part as doctor on the soap opera guiding light instead of exploring this timely matter in way relating the current tv craze since the does largely appear be satire of television albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the than the the simply uses bettys delusions as plot device get her from point no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use bit of rest and lot of contemplation,0.0

like good action should metro has action that keeps you involved some action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted other thoughts the ghost in the darkness opened few months ago is that action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts divert me it nearly put me asleep but metro is one of the best action films in while it is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy eddie murphy was in bad shape for while and this invites me mention last year the nutty professor was his blessed revival back the position at he used be metro happens be lot better than any in the beverly hills cop series that is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn prevent itself from having little fun eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people the beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as reckless wild cop always crossing the line just an inch in metro he plays hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble his character in metro takes himself seriously eddie murphy mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way murphy plays scott roper and as previously mentioned he is san francisco hostage negotiator in the first tense situation in the we are introduced roper kind of work as he tries calm down confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up murphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happygolucky misfit humor the develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda jewel thief and murderer who likes let cops know of his hostage fatalities giving them the ear of the victim metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the cable car cars flip cars crash cars turn over and it is done so good in this was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons there are also some other good scenes in metro that lot of films would rather choose not have scenes like the one roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner few little methods of betting and winning of course the writers tried disguise the scene as being insignificant having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too those are the scenes that make up metro is mainly about eddie murphy maturing as personality the actor that most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper new partner lipreading bookskimming genius and master of observation it was not the actor presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of proclaimed genius rapaport is an actor who usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite joy be able see him in role like this feel that respect him more there are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices the villain in metro is no more than device but he is darn good villain nonetheless he is played michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in abraded rasp as if he smokes cigarette between every take wincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death and in addition wincott physical appearance and mannerisms in the actually reminded my of an arrogant friend use have who is no longer on my good list liked metro and do not think would have worked any other actor but eddie murphy his past roles were the great ones but they were also precursor the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy growing as person now having family metro is nononsense movie it works as buddy movie it does not overplay it works as dry comedy it does not overplay it works as suspense it does not overplay and it works as an action where it does have tendency occasionally go allout but who cares it still remains serious and it does not overdo itself oh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well how nice it was of the filmmakers give us those if there is one major objection had metro it was the length an area where lot of action films seem wear out their welcomes metro is that lasted little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something do while waited for it end paul haynes,0.0

dear god this is fantastically bad regardless of what say about knock off you cannot grasp its awfulness from my words you have see it and experience it for yourself heres the kicker though suggest that you do so yes this is bad easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has certain misguided charm that makes it unique kind of disaster endure in fact enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and completely incomprehensible story do not get me wrong am not excusing knock off it reaches an unacceptable level of badness it is so incoherent that wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jeanclaude van damme it does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark as watched it occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness now in retrospect it seems clear that it was not but it is still fascinating kind of mess do not like writing plot descriptions it is far the most boring part of writing review but in this case am off the hook there is no way could write an accurate synopsis for knock off for the sake of comparison had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing paid closer attention knock off and the only thing am able say about it is that van damme plays dude named ray and is accused the cia think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like namebrand materials but are generic and cheap do not know what any of this has do martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the ray is good at martial arts so when he has beat up bad guys there is no problem rob schneider plays his sidekick although had no idea who he really was the end of the lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once in fact every character goes through so many shifts from good bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do in that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense but what strange mess it is it was written stephen de souza who also wrote die hard and hours can this be the same man do not see how unless of course huge chunks of the have been removed for the sake of running time knock off seems have an interesting premise as far as action films go but there is no semblance here for instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later he is running chariot race through the streets of hong kong why who knows what are the implications of this have no idea most action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally problem knock off however is the first that would have preferred see all of the talky sequences cut the acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines stiff and talentless insincerity sorvino in addition deserves better than this van damme is bad but he is charming in that bad way and so cannot say that he is hard watch although rarely understood what he was saying the only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny lot of the time tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame comparison they are all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the innerworkings of knock off running shoe but his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of fruit factory fruit factory is wellchoreographed lots of the scenes are pitched well comedy such as our heroes first encounter the rochon character but did tsui know that his is beyond ludicrous hope he did for the alternative is frightening thought knock off has the feel of truly terrible exercise in camp mania if it were boring would give it zero stars but it is not boring it is loud and excessive and completely incoherent it is also funny even when it is not meaning be funny bad that succeeds as entertainment does not deserve be fully lambasted recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but cannot deny it is zany useless charm oh know they are just action scenes looking desperately for real story but they are fun action scenes amongst crowd of laughably inane concepts it is fun admire the awfulness of like this but that does not excuse the fact that it is indeed awful,0.0
welcome your ohso typical sequel it tries be twice as big as it is predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow shallow hmm now there is an idea maybe if the illfated cruise liner in this movie had struck shallow reef early on things may have turned out better the first thing that struck me and surprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very different the original movie the characters well not many of the characters actually had characters but heres rundown annie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie why because somethings got account for her losing that many iq points even though annie was not exactly rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want beat your head against wall for instance after successfully using chainsaw cut hole in door so that group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people cannot get ut till she gets the chainsaw out of their faces bang bang bang in point of fact sandras character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has be rescued jason patric all can say is bring back keanu keanu reeves might have the emotional range of tree stump but that is one more tree stump than jason has do not think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras now frown said frown oh you are bang bang bang wooden just does not describe this guys performance but it will have do the bad guy ahh william dafoe there is bright move how can you go wrong the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence yes that is sarcasm his wide eyed maniac of character does not start out too bad but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses in the end he degenerates chasing annie around for hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang bang though would like give this movie double thumbs down there were some nice sequences considering the movie cost over million dollars you would hope there would be at least couple the real eyepopper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang bang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker this looks terrific and was very surprised hear that the cruise liner in it was completely computer generated wow do not think have ever seen cg model look so real before the sequence where jason patric in trying disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed this lackofspeed problem affects many sequences such as the oil tanker part it was oh no we are going hit the oil tanker minutes later oh no we are going hit the oil tanker min you get the point this movie failed simply because it did not live up it is name there was very little feeling of speed in the original movie the lead characters had make split second decisions survive in this movie it felt more like well people we are gonna run into that there island in few hours think might stroll over engineering and see if cannot turn off the engines am passing the cafeteria on the way can get anybody anything the ending of this movie really is terrible even though it features what have since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in movie it just does not work at all the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise surprise it just takes waaaaay too long it seemed go for minutes before the ship finally stopped one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around people are killed the ship and there is only or so people left on the ship so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait sec this is happy moment because bang bang then there was the dog almost fell out of my seat when saw the bit the dog dodging the falling debris putting dog in peril has become the ultimate cliche every movie seems have dogindanger sequence volcano dantes peak independence day daylight twister lost world etc etc this movie is perfect example of how not make sequel director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one backtoback and see if he realises where he went wrong,0.0

there should be requirement that potential viewer be under certain iq in order see mission mars there are probably quite few people who are going enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies space odyssey armageddon apollo the abyss close encounters of the third kind t the extraterrestrial alien and aliens why because there is not one original idea in mission mars all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films if this is the sort of thing you do not mind you might like the of course there are other reasons not like mission mars the main one being script written people who seem assume their audience is filled people who have not used their brains in some time and who do not intend start during the films running time mission mars manages be both stupid and boring at the same time the plot cribbed greatly from concerns team sent mars the first manned trip ever made the red planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulseemitting monolith in that one was on the moon but when they try study it giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough send garbled message back the rotating space station looks strangely like the rotating space station in rescue mission is planned husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell along for the ride after some zerogravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel now stranded on mars minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission mars is one of those films that makes critic wonder where start when talking about all the things that are wrong it so let us start one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages create some eerie tension in few scenes during the middle of the that is it everything else fails the failure is not de palmas fault he is working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in where the rescue teams air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission mars come life scene where they attempt save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire dangermore dangerattempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing do the rest of the it is just contrived way generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot is not affected in any way the sequence also suffers from few plot holes as does the rest of the why is the ships computer sounds strangely like hal from uh able detect hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins character have go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside should not the astronauts be better trained deal hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene rips off orson welles and robert altman utilizing long opening tracking shot during the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it is too bad you cannot go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this cannot we find out these things in less grating matter like maybe in flashback the whole is like that the filmmakers are not content merely show us something and assume we know what is going on they must tell us exactly what we are looking at every time sample dialogue from the shot of mars astronaut look there is mars astronaut you sure that is mars astronaut yeah that is mars all right astronaut hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange is not actually in mission mars but would not be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this have not learned do something all those directors did very well show and do not tell de palma used know how but seems have forgotten this is mentallychallenged filmmaking they assume the audience will not get what is going on so they explain everything five times over fourthgraders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission mars never managing do away an apparent am just here get paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin muellerstahl manages thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played kim delaney who only has one scene during she still manages deliver some ridiculous dialogue in heavyhanded monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolenfromnolessthanthreemovies lollipop whoever names them conclusion combines endless obvious explanation and subpar cgi effects gagging sentimentality and is sure alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission mars but such comment ignores the fact that the is also incredibly slowgoing leisurely pacing might have helped little more substance it but all of the substance of mission mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt their ideas in much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we are intended choke up when one character decides not return home at the end of this one totally different from the onecharacterdecidesnottoreturn ending of armageddon but suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over,0.0

begins communicate through their computer my name is jerry am happy flashes across the screen this is unsettling for the psychologist what happens if jerry gets mad he asks barnes is more pragmatic he needs last name because he cannot put in his report that they made contact an alien named jerry then the situation turns bad deadly beasts appear from nowhere gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel lethal sea snakes attack goodman giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading leagues under the sea the suspicious scientists turn against each other this has all the makings of firstrate thinking mans science fiction however even the finest ingredients do not go very far in the hands of chief who does not seem care about his product director barry levinson has churned out mishmosh that does not engage the audience beyond few skillful suspense scenes the first of the zooms as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification it is much like speedreading novel and realizing that you missed the nuances it does not get any better when the action scenes begin while the actors do an adequate job their limited roles the people are still flat oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them after adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers ask him what happened their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited even goodman and halperins illconceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing there is truism that items shown early in movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious when an emergency minisub is explained you know what is going happen the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting chapter headings that divide the movie have no function the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos much of what goes on is confusing and difficult follow although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable great deal of it is not even science fiction must be internally consistent there is too much here that does not make sense are the manifestations real the jellyfish kill queen latifa in throwaway role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect scene in the sub suggests that it is illusion but earlier episodes indicate that it is not not everything has be explained death but there are major questions that the never answers where the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in is merely alluded even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll the climax is followed minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale after prerelease audience testing the actors were called back reshoot the ending it is difficult imagine how the original could have been worse following the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours the weak scenes could have been cut but then there would not have been much left the movie was supposedly held up effects work but there is nothing special on the screen we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm stealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this has learned nothing from them remarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing is wag the dog smart and entertaining piece of work this one could have been titled the same sans one word,0.0

upon first viewing of this movie the phrases been there and done that come quickly mind spy hard manages steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of are airplane and the naked gun series stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff what little plot there is involves dick steele aka agent wd leslie nielsen trying save the world from an almost deranged madman played andy griffith along the way it goal goal the manages spoof mainly the james bond type films but also manages hit on films such as home alone and sister act the trick about spoofing is that you have actually be funny or at the least satirical spy hard achieves neither as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films the dick the world is in danger what is it well it is big roundish ball floating in space around the sun am paraphrasing type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the each time getting progressively less funny what they should have stolen were the background sight gags were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors especially nielsen who can do this quite well than on the delivery and context of their lines much of the time cutting the punchline short the whole seems be in race itself be over as is evident in the final sequence where there is no comedic denouement after the climax as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard the end credits tend replace this being out of context one of the more amusing was captain of the enterprise james kirk overall thought this was very weak effort while all of the right films spoof were chosen they used none of the right spoofing methods next time they should spy little bit harder excellent one of kind must see entertaining worth the price of admission fair nothing much special what were they thinking,0.0
first impressions critically closetoawful but moneywise it has been doing and will continue do great sometimesfunny that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring an orginal plot that grows old real fast one of the only minute films that have gotten bored through men in black has defied the odds when first saw that the flick was minutes long thought maybe that this was poor attempt at an independence day type that just ran out of gas however now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas but the in minutes manages show off very original idea summer audiences have embraced that becomes old about minutes into the movie tommy lee jones and will smith play two government agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society the ridiculous plot begins when an alien bug played weirdly vincent donofrio who was so great in full metal jacket lands on earth retrieve galaxy that is somewhere on orions belt anyway the basic plot revolves around jones and smith stop this bug from getting the galaxy or higher power will blow up the earth the premise is ridulous but that is not why did not like this love original plots this one had an original one but director barry sonnenfeld did something this that ruined its plot he made the drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films whenever saw donofrios bug stomp and eat people in the it got terribly boring after while while smiths wisecracks did fill in the gaps it was not enough and also cannot believe the screenwriters elected have subplot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent they cannot have contact any humans really and here see jones at satellite computer watching his lover plant the garden sentimental moment in an alien movie nice try but do not think so it does not work here it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring we do not only have aliens worry about but now we have joness conscience came into the movie not wanting see joness conscience but wanting see real action movie that had lots of aliens in it maybe it is unfair that partly judged this movie on what my expectations were nevertheless even though some parts are indeed funny the plot in this movie grew old and boring quick,0.0

warning may contain slight mild spoilers rated for intense violencegore some strong sexuality and language starring arnold schwarzeneggar robin tunney rod stieger gabriel byrne running time minutes we go into movie theater boom the lights go down our hearts race we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we have been waiting see for long time comes on we sit there watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is why should not have know what was getting myself into again like this past summers hit stigmata end of days may be worse it is not like this is any kind of original idea it just throws in some rosemarys baby along the devils advocate little exorcist and some stigmata here and there whala you have end of days movie that is extremely disappointing and the previews made it look terrific sadly but truly again like most recent films all the good parts are in the trailers the plot is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined be hit in the first weekend and flop in the next jericho cane arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role is cop who finds out that he is chosen track down satan living in gabriel byrnes body and stop him from impregnating christine york robin tunney because if he does and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease exist he has do this before it turns into the year and strangely he is trying fight him minutes before comes he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger in terrific role and tries save this girl leading an ending that is satisfying but turns into typical action movie that is pretty much it on plot it does have the razzle and dazzle of great action movie and the dollar budget parts seem show it parts you have wonder where all the money went as for arnie good role ok performance think since he is getting little older he is held back lot of his stunts the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing the in the trailers it looks like good scary action and ends up being boring long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us questions gabriel byrnes who ironically played priest in stigmata here plays satan and gives good performance but again seems held back and not into his character two years back al pacino gave terrific performance in the fun the devils advocate and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also robin tunney great performance as always plays satans main person whom he wants impregnate carry his child of course rod stieger gives another great performance really is not nothing new the direction peter hyams is at times bit overblown though not nearly as the visual style was in stigmata here we are given great camera work and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just do not work in this movie the script written andrew marlowe has few witty lines but again the movie is all style and no substance and the ending finale climax was ready go home only few things work here and those are few of the performances the writing and visual style but the storyline and the finished product do not work as well the sad thing is that end of days had so many things going for it the plot could have been more organized the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mindnumbing at times it seems like armageddon and started get old and tiresome is running out of ideas bad and like have always said before needs new ones even its budget end of days is less than pleasing in fact the dollar budget is at least over and easily could have had m budget maybe sound crazy but am really looking forward the new exorcist and hope that they make it as good as the original we need get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just make money at the boxoffice we need get more films like the blair witch project that could scare people death while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do know that it is in fact the blair witch overblown effects stupid and thin plotline good performances disappointing umm yup those pretty much describe end of days,0.0
my name is jack carter and you do not want know me says our brooding antihero sylvester stallone take his advice know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over terrace and watch this is almost as painful get carter is gloomy looking unimaginative that offers no joy jack carter is as tough as tough guys come he works out of vegas as selfdescribed financial adjuster explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them help them remember he has chiseled body full of tattoos he has the weathered look indicative of man who has seen his share of hard times he speaks in hushed but menacing tone of voice in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester stallone and like most of his previous roles his character is shallow onedimensional thug whose modus operandi is talk tough hassle few hapless people find out what he needs know and then dispense his own kind of justice the charisma of pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows yet even tough guys know when put family first as the story begins we learn that jacks little brother has died in car accident the police attribute it heavy drinking however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out he takes break from his vegas duties and tries see if he can find the truth as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters they include shady business partner prostitute dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of porn website any one of them may know something about his brothers death all of them have the means of carrying out the deed but do not expect an exercise in sleuthing where wellplaced clues lead carter the truth he is all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation instead he uses intimidation muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects flustered his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again this all gets tiring fairly quickly the time the launches into its final act we are numb from its pedestrian pace oddly as toughguy thriller it starves us for action admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related tangential and needless plot carters vegas ties send thugs retrieve him the story also fails generate any kind of emotion stallone has the personality of slab of stone and the look and feel of the is perpetually downcast the weather is constantly overcast or rainy meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys it is just impossible get stirred about that kind of atmosphere as result get carter amounts nothing more than flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement you are better off leaving this guy alone,0.0
you would think that this films dismal failure would be due american filmmakers getting hold of brilliant british comedy and americanizing it you would be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis should you ever happen meet those chaps do me favor grab them the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking have you ever heard the phrase if it as not broke do not fix it then walk away the concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit america while escorting the painting of whistlers mother an american buyer played burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away now how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and cannot even describe how the explains it the point is that mr bean comes america and causes wacky trouble problems problems problems where begin first the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy then the song choices are totally uninspired good vibrations love a wow do not put any thought into that guys also bean makes way too much noise in the the character does not speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean each episode was like chaplin silent movie in the bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc it is annoying and just plain wrong for the character the main problem though is that it is just not funny each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than minutes multiply that running time three however and the laughs steadily decrease they even have the gaul repeat jokes from the series sad and creatively lazy as series mr bean only ran for about episodes or so why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time completely rework everything halfhour episodes certainly had not exhausted all possible situations all can say positively for the at this point is that it is almost appropriate for all ages if it was not for couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex things and even that is not very positive statement please guys go back england and go back television so you will make me laugh again pg,0.0
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability rise above the most inept material and suffuse it his irreverent style overwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best the notable exception of flubber so when the one person who has refused abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know it is in trouble jakob the liar is confused muddled little movie generically uplifting fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed inspiring and the movie does not realize it williams plays jakob haim jew imprisoned in polish ghetto during world war ii one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent the office of highranking german officer for his punishment jakob gets off easy and he gets hear approximately seconds of radio broadcast the announcement in english but punctuated triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakobs ghetto liberation he thinks the next day jakob tells the news his closest friend volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn secrecy passes the message along soon it is common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has radio hidden in his home crime punishable death this is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is decide their fate the danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger in curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides hide her in his small home apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes great length make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear he and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings his ghetto is false such hope inevitably leads expectations of its realization and when those expectations are not met the results are far worse than if there was no hope that is the films biggest detriment it is based on false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false it is never moving because it does not give us anything be moved jakob the liar fails tug any heartstrings destroys its purpose for existing robin williams does not inject the life as matter of fact he seems little out of it as if crippled his fake accent he is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style this extent this is not the robin williams we know and love in good will hunting he became serious actor and won an oscar for it here he is more of wannabe serious actor an impostor jakob the liar will be compared last years life is beautiful because it is being marketed as holocaust comedy it is not comedy it tries sometimes but it rarely works is it melodrama war movie character study no no and no jakob the liar is the kind of movie that cannot be placed into category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts,0.0

it should have been classic great cast of respected supporting actors an interesting premise of loser comic book characters however mystery men proved be one of the great disappointments of the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh their unique rituals the number of cliches and shallow characters made the difficult sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having fast paced premise the script tried deliver series of small jokes throughout the but without big laughoutloud joke and mediocre small jokes it failed miserably at being entertaining at all the jokes were not funny for number of reasons they had been used number of times before in previous films the best ones were mediocre begin were ruined in the trailer and the expectation of laughing at clever unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none laugh at greatly damaged the mystery men might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying break into the business but veterans doing this kind of junk it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives help viewers forget this little movie the follows band of wannabe superheroes living in wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure save they day and capture the bad guy the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has successful superhero captain amazing who has recently captured every evildoer in the city captain amazing played terribly an uninspired greg kinnear because of his success in the past is worried that he will lose popularity after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city geoffrey rush overacting just bit too much keep himself busy things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured it is up the wannabe superheroes save the day the time this section of the plot is finished the interest for what happens if you have not already figured it out is very low there are very few scenes catch the viewers complete attention the first scene in the shows the wannabes trying save the day feels like it was seriously edited down right when it was beginning become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folks home some masked goons captain amazing comes in and saves the day or ruins the movie instead of editing this scene more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr furious ben stiller and monica waitress claire forlani or the vast majority of the is the heroes talking at coffee table about how their day was simple rule more silly action is needed in order make silly action movie work another major problem mystery men is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances the depended on its cast work fluently together like bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion however most characters seemed like they did not even want be in this or at least the script made it seem this way pull one of the actors in this randomly out of hat paul reubens who disappeared from acting everyones joy returns here leaving very little be impressed about as wannabe who uses flatulence for weapon all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks the success of american pie and there is something about mary mystery men drags on towards the end point where anything else in the world is more entertaining anyone brain knows each one of the heroes is going be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going contribute in helpful way so why continue watch this is far from worthy guilty pleasure mystery men indeed does this and every time character succeeds another one congratulates him and says knew you could do it mystery men fails in every category it attempts pass what makes this so bad is that it had the potential be wonderful and unforgettable terrible acting terrible script and terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors am unpredictable an overexcited ben stiller shouts out no ben you are the complete opposite,0.0

i want be involved in show business one day and refuse do any sequels any movie may make because believe they only get worse this movie proves it for me was little worried about the last batman as thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne they did not kilmer did good job and the cast was left carry the movie they did even jim carrey as the riddler and cannot stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles this is different the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up the direction he is one of those directors who is good actors terrible camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith does not really give an impressive cast anything do the cast is impressive clooney is surprisingly good waynebatman odonnell is crafty robin as usual they could have casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is good poison ivy the major problem is schwarzenegger who is terrible freeze his accent is so heavy you cannot understand what he says and the trouble action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say limited amount of stuff and kill bunch of guys then they figure nobodyll notice that is the trouble me notice schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but thinks he does patrick stewart was the person would heard that was considered play freeze and he would have been so much better or sean connery but not arnold am not an actor but play one in real life schwarzenegger realize that you must be star play major role in batman but it would have been nice if they would casted star that had talent for the role akiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in normal batman in regular batman they would concentrate on the relationship the girlfriend little more but elle macphersons julie madison is so limited here that we never get real sense of who she is there is talk of fifth batman movie my interest see it is low but hope it is better than this if you do not want waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster any other,0.0

holy man boasts sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and few moderately funny skits unfortunately get the good stuff you have sit through painfully long setup loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggias career if ever movie screamed wait for video so you can fastforward through all the dull and annoying parts this is it eddie murphy plays a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message chance meeting ricky hayman goldblum stressedout executive of homeshopping channel and kate newell kelly preston nononsense media analyst results in physical injury quicker than you can say the odd couple ends up rooming an extremely leery ricky after some script gymnastics appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations enraging network owner mr mcbainbridge loggia and becoming national media sensation holy man attempts be several things at once it tries satirize home shopping networks but it is difficult effectively make fun of something that is already selfparody the attempts teach us that collecting material possessions is merely futile attempt fill the spiritual holes in our hearts but that is common knowledge already holy man also tries present story of redemption as ricky hayman tries decide whether exploit gs good will achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career anyone want place wager on his final decision the one genuine asset in holy man is eddie murphy who gives charming performance sharing love good will and relevant advice all those around him while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments murphy is delightful and the takes off whenever he is onscreen unfortunately he is not onscreen enough jeff goldblum gets the lions share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down as his potential love interest kelly preston tries brighten things up but she transforms from an allbusiness media shark an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance the other principal actor robert loggia wastes his talents in onenote turn as ruthless screaming monster structurally unsound and way too long holy man is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he is not instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle wait until it hits video and fastforward past everything except the murphy scenes suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that is the best way do so,0.0
it is actually not so bad that dreamworks decided release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode the phantom menace because this way less people will have sit through this dreadful little comedy and no really do not feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice really do not not at all the plot has been done before mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and the way what is it bookstore owner main characters in the past year and half we have seen them in life is beautiful you have got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore she immediately starts testing other people see who it might be from and comes the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is young employee played tom everett scott he reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him after while they fall in love well duh kate feels guilty about getting in relationship someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved the town fireman tom selleck add her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits supporting characters are not called supporting for nothing their purpose is not just move the plot along they are also supposed give the storyline backbone do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting rarely can movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions them this is the love letters damning error capshaws character is as good as have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional because of that the love letter is awkward and insincere even worse it is bore liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential exist there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks there is little that is even little amusing this is not completely thoughtless and director peter hosun chan does good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities but it is far from profound there is not common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless really this is harmless little movie it is far from an abomination and it is not torturous sit through but bad it is awful it also is the love letter is failure and an inane failure at that eugene novikov,0.0

some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning liveaction version of mr magoo being prime example the cartoon figure mr magoo the bumbling blind man can be quite funny but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is dubious choice play the role of the short guy who runs into walls you are right but there is an even more astonishing selection for director they tapped hong kongs stanley tong whose resume consists mainly of handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan the story such that there is one is about large stolen ruby looks woolworth reject mr magoo gets it and of course does not realize he has it mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other mr magoo frequently oblivious the fact that anyone is being chased like home alone but without any class mr magoo can only be described as painfully bad fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity the movies humor is pathetically lame and the pacing is way off when one is stuck in theater for an hour and half watching what claims be motion picture one looks for some solace mr magoo provides only three such moments the movie begins and ends the classic cartoon version of the character who exudes his usual charm the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus the sweet little bulldog angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture finally the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked rather than attempt adapt mr magoo noncartoon movie nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying literally be human version of the cartoon he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny my wife managed get some sleep during the movie but was not so lucky hopefully this picture will force producers think harder about subjects have promise and do not mr magoo runs it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages my son jeffrey age said he thought the movie was good and really funny but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie he said he liked home alone much more his friend maxim age said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense his other friend nickolas age said he would give the movie but that it was really silly,0.0
breakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route california through redneck country however while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides break down leaving them stranded friendly truck driver warren walsh offers give them lift town although jeff rejects the offer he wants stay his car amy agrees hops into warrens lorry and promptly disappears jeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on chase find his wife although comparisons can be made this deliverance and the vanishing plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise kurt russell is k as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression is angry throughout the whole he looks angry or just pissed off quinlan is k again but again she can only pull off one expression is looking dorky throughout the whole she looks dorky t walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough the supporting cast do their best aswell rex linn as doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers the story written firsttimer jonathan mostow who also directs is k if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy there are some flaws the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite logical presumably keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just is not strong enough sustain the audiences attention the picture moves along very slowly also it almost threatens drop dead the picture does pick up towards the end but then it is too late mostow directs the action sequences well enough however the does not really come satisfying conclusion either the ending tries be bleak but just comes off annoying breakdown could of been far more enjoyable picture had it had stronger cast and director instead it just turns out be merely average missed opportunity overall rating review david wilcock,0.0

i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for fellow american or more the point anyone that allows him bask in his own lessthansubtle presence this is not an insult gere as consider him be rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role if is solely about one person the main actor must give faultless performance in order for it really work although geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and look forward seeing him star other talented actors that can reduce the need for him carry himself this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant believe me than look no further that primal fear the sensational edward norton the jackal bruce willis and pretty woman the delightful julia roberts in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind it is invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed left me barracking for the chinese haul his sorry ass into jail it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm work on pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in hotel room drunk and cheerful yet instead of hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on couch he is arrested and hauled into chinese prison his cell food and rights all terrible now trapped in foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case initially pleading guilty the charge of murder jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet your family as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy scooby doo ending where the least expected butyouknewalong criminal is discovered red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes what should have been politically taunt thriller is little more than pointless expedition see how stressed out richard gere can act this is not say that the does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption but what they amount spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating watch if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before if that wasnt bad enough red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions shen yuelin attempts gain sympathy reciting renaissance of destitute relationship her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on plan free himself taking itself far too seriously red corner is not half the it intends be although it would have benefited from the help of more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding story isnt that meritorious anyway whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes be known as decent actor would think twice before going see him attempt manage such serious yet hollow drama again martin vailwhere are you,0.0

actually am fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie baywatch babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her doubleds on the small screen at least there you do not have pay see her cleavage and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless hate burst your bubble but there are no fullfledged nude scenes in barb wire you would not be reading this review right now if had known that fact going in cannot go back in time and reverse my mistake but can warn other horny teenage boys out there they do tease us few times scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude it is so quick you cannot even tell for sure whether you are seeing her andersons or not nipple hallucination sort of thing barb wire was adapted from comic book interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like comic book character in real life even wearing lowcut leather do office work businesswoman bondage wear and having unreal body proportions yes like the mona lisa pamela anderson is manmade beauty probably in more senses than one she is definite beauty though and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience you would just think the woman who began her career as playboy playmate would not have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie because it is obvious she was not pulling sharon stone and trying make people pay attention her acting skills mean she shows off more cleavage here than jewelers convention the movie is set in the year the worst year of my life pam says the worst movie of the year say america is going through second civil war and pamela is nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation silicone valley think she also hires herself out as bounty hunter when the price is right posing as first stripper and later as prostitute but do not call her babe she hates that and reminds us of that fact way too many times imagine woman who does trapeze strip tease in bar while having hose sprayed on her being referred in such sexist demeaning term liberated woman like pamela anderson should not have hear words like babe during strip tease especially since that movie about the talking pig was such success the plot haha revolves around pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer pass through the congressional directorates retina scanners in the words of one of the characters they are more than meets the eye reminds me of the transformers cartoon and sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent but that never happened no the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela vandamme bigbusted kickboxer and her resistance accomplices exboyfriend axel tamuera morrison and cora victoria rowell thank god they did not name her cora reef one bad character name is more than enough pamela originally does not take sides giving some speech about she is only loyal the money they pay her but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother jack noseworthy of bon jovi always video fame still do not know if barb wire is step up or step down for noseworthy but he definitely is nose worthy even if he is not sponge worthy pam gets ready avenge his death grabbing up an armful of semiautomatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt her chest it is not rambo it is bimbo mark my words barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in year it is got all the elements of the directtovideo releases featured on hbos bastard cousin the cable channel would never watch if it did not somehow come free it is got the nontitillating scenes of voyeurism laughable flashbacks bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo there is even narrator at the beginning setting up the movies premise while the words scroll up the screen someone needs tell pamela the wookie this as not star wars if you have seen any action flick of the past fifteen years you will recognize plenty of lifted elements barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over car crashes explosions broken glass and slowmotion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet their death this is one of those automaticpilot movies anyone could write or direct barb wire has only two things going for it and think you know what those two things are,0.0

adam sandler is not known for appearing in deep thoughtprovoking films but he is still really funny guy most of his movies are successful not because of the making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without stupid plot drown him out big daddy is the first in the story seems more important than sandlers comic performance and it is miserable failure sandler plays thirtysomething loser who gets attached an orphaned young boy played cole and dylan sprouse as one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including repulsive courtroom battle and lot of teary scenes in characters say goodbye one another in addition there is ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself there is hilarious running joke featuring female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny,0.0

when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in jackie brown he immediately signed up for little called american perfekt this was almost two years ago waited patiently for the be released but it never was finally forgot about it the other day though while was perusing the selection of the local video store stumbled upon you guessed it american perfekt immediately rented it and certain amount of glee rushed home view it having now seen the understand why it never saw theatrical release american perfekt is jumbled mess the storyline is nonexistent it took me half the movie just figure out what was going on and at that point the only thing really knew for sure was that the movie was never going introduce plot of some sort it wants get on quirkyness and socalled charm alone and it just does not work robert forster plays psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer and they head off on the road together along the way no discernable destination they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters suppose this freewheeling no plot style is supposed give the an element of danger and excitment but all it did was make me sleepy am all for trying new things within the realm of but not at the expense of coherence nothing in this movie makes sense the actions of the characters go unexplained even when they are truly bizarre will give you an example without giving too much away david thewlis has part as drifting conman at one point midway through the movie he runs forster and plummer off the road his car as he passes them we see that his face is covered in blood do you think we would get an explanation as what happened him you would think so would not you american perfekt is waste of time nothing is gained from watching this movie except maybe migraine and if you do rent it do not bother trying figure out what is going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved the end this does not happen and no explanation is given for the misspelling of perfect either,0.0
you would think that after awhile would stop trying make movies out of video games it has not worked so far street fighter super mario brothers wing commander mortal kombat not watchable in the bunch still held out some hope for tomb raider after all the games premise is heavily influenced the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves be yet another bomb the plot is convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from dozen bad movies there is onceeveryears alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order take over the world of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead of course no one was expecting much of plot from this movie anyway in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality there is lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of cheap directtocable flick the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and largescale since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie has not taken any projects that would display her acting talents tomb raider seems be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn them that it is shame there is no oscar for best performance wonderbra while we do not see much of her acting ability the exception of wonderful uppercrust british accent we do get hint of jolies less savory side considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession death having lara be obsessed resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems poor choice having jolies real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier have not decided what make of director simon west yet his first feature was the starstudded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved the generals daughter was thick sultry atmosphere now this train wreck hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents chance for redemption the way speaking of british tv red dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major role,0.0
it is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time based on the stephen king series of the same title the starts out painfully slow underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue however as the plot begins progress the turns into pure perfection outstanding performances and wonderful direction frank darabont who masterfully followed prisoners story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks through edgecombs experiences on cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law from an evil prison guard an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kindhearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships each eventually are forced execute them the performances veterans and new comers back up these original characters are superb the ensemble acting in the is perfect hanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles they are the characters we most relate because of their calm less extreme roles they are given the positions make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan hutchinson playing percy wetmore cowardly guard who hides his true feelings tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie every time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able create are effectively terrifying it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks rockwell an independent veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton perfection as prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having watch him torture others this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable the last noteworthy performance belongs duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens hold the power of curing the ill duncan does wonderful job playing frightened childlike behemoth very similar lennie small in of mice and men his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause his pain creates pain for the viewer however it takes over an hour for duncan be introduced completely in the the opens ridiculous present day setting contains scene that jabs at the jerry springer show the scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief as the flashes back graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing greene is not even given final word like some of the other characters and we do not even see him walk the infamous green mile however as the begins specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the becomes more interesting the speed in the green mile is perfect if time was matter of concern and the was edited the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able know the characters as they are or as they treat others the three hour running is perfect for plot development and the end of the great amount of love or hate is attached each character the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene fighting back tears was difficult task that barely succeeded in doing if you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment,1.0
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maids point of view is in word dark you would not expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevensons novel but the is surprisingly dreary and dismal jekyllhyde john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate mary reilly julia roberts is victim of monstrous child abuse and the antiwoman sentiment of the times director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears be filmed in black and white the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off strawberry except there is no red of course the look is so moody and melodramatic that you will be shocked when you leave the theater saw it at matinee and took quite while adjust the sunny skies afterward often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience two parts that make up whole neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished demeanor and attitude when we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles both are suitably melancholy fitting in the rest of the the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents life and color maybe but this is not closes best role she seems little more than cardboard cutout character beautiful in its own dreary way you will appreciate the filmmaking craft but do not expect leave in an upbeat mood,1.0
aggressive bleak and unrelenting about an interracial couple steve and sam damon jones and elexa williams respectively who are viciously attacked in parking garage one night gang of skinheads the skinheads beat steve then force him watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again when sam kills herself later that evening steve decides that the skinheads must be taught lesson waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads forget about the incident entirely steve shaves his head dresses in combat boots and suspenders tattoos his flesh nazi symbols and tries infiltrate the gang as he gets closer and closer the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend he begins learn just how vicious these people really are and starts question his own motives for violence randolph krets script based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the films producer shaun hill is an affront on violence and intolerance the causes its audience be subjected such brutality and ignorance that one cannot help but be disgusted the events presented within have seen it said that this is the fight club should have been but david finchers was trying define generation krets is wake up call generation and his message is powerful one if fincher is the kubrick of our generation then kret is our w griffith thematically speaking there is not single likable character in the the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the not only because of their beliefs but because they are in constant state of fury not just against other races but within their own circles the africanamerican characters in the are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on joyride looking for someone accost even gay men get in on the act locating the skinheads lair and beating them severely lead pipes and other blunt objects the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just seek out revenge what all of this comes down is the simple message that violence begets violence and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society the cast of this is absolutely remarkable damon jones shows raw energy that many actors cannot seem summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful his initial reaction hearing about his girlfriends suicide is one of the most affecting scenes have ever seen in david lee wilson who plays appropriately enough david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads wilsons character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly sadly actor dave ward who portrays the character of crew will not be able follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of vicious act of violence himself at the hands of fellow actor during an incident of road rage ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed note it is shame that the filmmakers had add disclaimer the end of the stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the condone racism the message about hatred could not be spelled out any more clearly than it is here but there are those who would probably find this much more akin training video than condemnation there are no winners at the end of this either no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began where american history had redemption for most of its characters no such victories are in store for pariahs band of twisted souls it is this bleak ending that carries the films most powerful message the message that despite what you may be able momentarily do put your own mind rest evil will still be us and in many forms and there is very little than can be done eradicate it entirely,1.0

of all the films have come see this year think only chasing amy had as many laughoutloud moments am not saying that was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open at least delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes and think am the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when find them funny usually all you can get out of me is warm smile so get me laughing out loud and so frequently is really good sign waiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri town celebrating it is th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event the play is being directed corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as cowriting several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined make this production smashing success teaming up st clair are handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine ohara respectively married couple setting their sights on libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and few others everybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out these characters are portrayed such saddening realism that you cannot help but love them as pathetic as they really are although levy stands out guest willard ohara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it some humor was tad uneven from the rest of the and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me the tadtoolong intros as delightful as it was it began get monotonous thankfully just as your about say ok maybe should run the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes like play this gives very threeact feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent like said each character really shines even when done subtle approach you cannot really watch these people and not think they are real people even they way they talk awkward pauses and stumbles that do not feel staged at all you feel like you are watching real albeit funny documentary and even silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful as word of note despite it is rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean this rating came from brief very brief use of the granddaddy of all swear words even if that really bothers you let me say that it is not presented in vulgar cheaplaugh way it is actually quite humorous and tastefully done it might be hard knowing what expect waiting for guffman it is silly humor but it is also so dry subtle and intelligently done that you are not insulted it it is always really nice see comedy that is not all slapstick and vulgarity and this is one of the better ones of the better ones would recommend seeing it,1.0
in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well taken as whole there is little that is special about this tale it follows traditional narrative path leaves the audience warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us but it is intelligently written dialogue that is occasionally brilliant strongly directed and nicely acted so while good will hunting is far from lateyear masterpiece it is worthwhile sample of entertainment like scent of woman was released around this time of the season five years ago good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between worldweary veteran and cocky young man the formula for the two films is similar both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way better understanding of life and their place in it but the characters are different al pacinos slade was largerthanlife individual robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle and matt damons will hunting uses pugnaciousness supplant the blandness of chris odonnells charlie will is troubled individual as child he was the frequent victim of abuse an orphan he was in and out of foster homes on regular basis now not yet years old he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet he has short temper and any little incident can set him off like spark in tinder box but he is mathematical genius photographic memory and the ability conceive simple solutions complex problems while working as janitor at mit he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math buildings hall blackboards then one evening his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau stellan skarsgard catches him at work will flees but lambeau tracks him down unfortunately the time the professor finds him will is in jail for assaulting police offer the judge agrees release will under two conditions that he spend one day week meeting lambeau and that he spend one day week meeting therapist eventually once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man sean mcguire teacher at bunker hill community college agrees take the case after rocky start the two form rapport and will begins explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor and as will advances his selfawareness in sessions sean he also learns about friendship from his buddy chuckie ben affleck and love from harvard coed named skylar minnie driver the script costars matt damon and ben affleck is not groundbreaking piece of literature and occasionally resorts shameless manipulation the characters are welldeveloped however and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles at one point will comments that session sean is turning into tasters choice moment later will gives brilliant breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written kevin smith note since smith coexecutive produced good will hunting it is not out of the question that he had some input into this scene director gus van sant drugstore cowboy die for culls genuine emotion from his actors and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes there is an edginess some of the seanwill therapy sessions and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver who became romantically linked while making this translates effectively the movie the willskylar relationship is electric likewise the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckies friendship many of the individual scenes are strong enough earn good will hunting recommendation even if the overall story is somewhat generic matt damon who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker is solid although not spectacular as will minnie driver last seen in grosse pointe blank adds another strong performance growing resume and it is refreshing that she was allowed keep her british accent rather than having attempt an american one the outstanding performance of the belongs robin williams whose sean is sad and wise funny and somber arguably the best dramatic work in the actors career alongside what he did in the fisher king williams portrayal could earn him best supporting actor oscar nomination adequate support is provided ben affleck chasing amy and stellan skarsgard breaking the waves like most of what comes before it the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable but meeting expectations and following familiar path are not always bad things in movie provided the accomplishes those goals modicum of style and an attention detail good will hunting does both and as result earns rating commensurate the good in the title,1.0

the dream team is thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen be slightly insane billy played michael keaton is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend get him in trouble christopher lloyd portrays henry an obsessivecompulsive who requires that everything be neat orderly on schedule and the books he thinks he is doctor so he walks around wearing suit and carrying clipboard on he constantly scribbles notes and files reports jack played peter boyle thinks he is jesus and finally there is stephen furst as albert chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the foursome when their psychiatrist dr weitzman takes them out of the hospital for field trip yankee stadium during pit stop they get separated from weitzman and are left fend for themselves in manhattan the movies charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast the four leads in the play off each other quite effectively they never miss an opportunity argue bicker or insult one another henry and jack for example fight over who is going get ride in the front passenger seat on the way the game the actors in the dream team have lot of fun their characters and each other michael keaton is well cast as billy he gives his cynical character considerable complexity as the divinely jack peter boyle succeeds in keeping his onedimensional character funny and fresh although stephen fursts catatonic character is cliched the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing while keaton boyle and furst are good it is christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance his body language for example the way he walks and his facial expressions are perfectly suited his compulsive character lloyds brilliant performance yields pathetic moving and memorable character the dream team is solid comedy more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot,1.0
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced unpleasant surprises due the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple technothriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but believe there are really few cases when movie labelled as science fiction actually happens be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment the right stuff directed philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained the fact that the official poster of the features men in space suits but the right stuff is not even fiction it was based on the nonfiction book tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is determine ability of manned aircraft reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried achieve that goal and many paid their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order regain national prestige us government decides be the first send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in such high position could be explained the fact that kaufmans looks quite atypical for its time more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for and age when used make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in using all the opportunities of that golden age in order create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors spend big bucks on unusual risktaking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of the plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager new generation of the astronauts the also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the but equal time and exposure is also given other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture this character subtle gestures and phrases shepards performance is followed great acting ed harris as cleancut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this was mirrored kaufmans superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order suggest the passage of time the beginning of the shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it is quite normal for important technical problems be solved simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance ussr is replaced cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played scott beach only preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had use special effects in order simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this is oscar awarded musical score bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear it it is accompanied the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts are not fleshed out enough although being played fine actors like lance henriksen also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the landing on the moon would require this be more than six hours long also some critics were prone attack this as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach claiming that he wanted make as authentic as possible and in order do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived americans in early time has passed now we do not see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want be astronauts when they grow up but this sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema,1.0
i find most of television so intensely boring that simply never turn on my set unless am watching movie do not even have cable so went radio shack buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the xfiles every sunday night it is the only show that is worth an hour of my time each week though since do not watch reruns am glad that have six months of the year avoid television altogether am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now and love gillian anderson the xfiles is the that continues the story where the season finale left off the is like twohour episode except that there are lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying this is terrific both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it imagine that viewers unfamiliar the show will find the be solid and riveting entertainment expected like it more than any episode have seen and my expectations were met actually the takes few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed do it right when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the xfiles had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work the picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced field agents investigating bomb threat in federal building but wait am getting ahead of myself the actually opens in the ice age about years prior during couple of prehistoric guys get attacked vicious alien the aliens blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer and the story jumps into modern times during young boy is also infected the cancer it turns out that the bomb was planted kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the coverup despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi soon they find out that the whole thing has do aliens as have written before it is not easy write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs be surprise fans of the show will know what expect and seriously doubt any of them being disappointed the director rob bowman has done great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes utilize the possibilities that allows over television there are some truly suspenseful and wellcreated scenes here late in the when they are in the alien spacecraft you will see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema the special effects are very good and the production design christopher nowak is fantastic what find interesting is that the xfiles is actually great way for series neophytes get into the story our heroes are given subtle introductions we are not expected know them on the outset and the explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series is not required understand the there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff the fans but will keep those as surprises it takes lot of thought and understanding of the series create using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create coherent that anyone can understand clearly the series is strong for lot of reasons it is original though it has many ties the twilight zone and owes some homage hitchcock and impressively eerie for television show what really makes the series shine however are the actors duchovny has so much presence and is just fun guy watch he has that confidence that will someday make him into bankable leading man anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful she is also strong actress both performers have acted in little more than their series however though think they will both get their chances prove themselves very soon enthusiastically recommend the xfiles both for fans and nonfans is summer filled disappointing blockbusters and this should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry it is an intelligent and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar the xfiles is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely be highly critical and take the premise beyond the series is risky move it is nice see risk pay off for change actually it is nice see risk at all,1.0
the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant you know where you sit down watch it and no matter what you have heard about it before you just cannot help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked every single turn that occurs prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like do not really feel there are be any real rules for cinema can do anything as long as it makes it work but do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences when watch no matter what kind of it is want be able take certain memories along me the celebration is great because it is chock full of those it creates world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay you for the rest of your life and then it makes things just tad bit farscial just make sure you are paying attention you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were ever feel bored then you are of your attention span needs bit of tuningup the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned and is having party thrown for him all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking bit like young malcolm mcdowell is the first be seen in the walking his fathers home his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them walk the estate just so christian can be comfortable we then meet helene paprika steen their sister woman who always seems be stressedout who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american come join her at the party she is going once they are all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has make speech his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the films punchline his father raped all his children at young age but since this is familyfriends affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed jean renoir and it is all terribly interesting watch twists occur and soon the has taken on nearlyfarsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends the most notorious thing about this has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in completely awkward fashion as member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme group that has vowed oppose the auteur concept makeup illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot have not seen breaking the waves the other notable member of this group lars von trier be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department it feels like reality like you are actually watching real people and not actors and as major pointer has been shot on video as result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual but always wanted we see key moments in peoples lives that they would not dare show the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironicallyshowmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the the key though this and the reason it is not just cool danish import is because this is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react such an explosive truth throughout the we see completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned live lies debate so threedimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his thetruthatallcosts reasoning out of the water of course it was not right for the father rape his children and of course they could not have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them and yes it is thearapeutic for one release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier but then again the father after all is not totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks performance mortizen is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see man who has also learned live what he is done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning surface the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them the actors or writers have not made the mistake judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks

matthew broderick and high school comedy the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in now it is years later and broderick has another high school comedy election show the world ferris buehlers day off showed an educational setting that was similar pile of marshmallows it was light fluffy tasty and sparkling clean but election is far different this production is dark and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the minutes it occupies it shocks as well jim mcallister matthew broderick is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud he is kind caring younger man who has built his life around carver high school in turn carver high school has provided home for him jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his year span and is well respected social studies teacher among the student body tracy flick reese witherspoon is an intelligent outgoing and quote the super nice young girl she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities always has her hand up first in class and is extremely popular among most of the student body so it is natural progression when she decides run for school president the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one the father dick holmes osborne owns cement company the mother jo jeanine jackson is an ideal housewife and the two children paul chris klein and tammy jessica campbell are both students at carver high school paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself and is definitely candidate for most popular person in school tammy is lesbian who say the least is going through period of self discovery for reasons of revenge hatred and sexual envy jim convinces paul run against tracy for school president he claims that in democracy you need choices and having tracy run unopposed creates dictatorship of sorts so paul agrees and the race is on but then in an effort spite the two candidates tammy announces that she is running as well her campaign is straightforward people only run put it on their college applications then they do nothing well do not even want go college she says in election there are no good guys almost everyone has their own agenda no matter how deeply hidden the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school she is the girl that would be labeled most likely achieve anything she wants in the yearbook and everyone secretly envied her because of that jim is teacher that takes the trust that students give him as privilege and uses it his own amoral advantage everyone including the principal former teacher all the candidates and even pauls girlfriend are two sided characters that is much of this films beauty it does not have the typical good guys that likes instead it is realistic portrayal of the real world specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep themselves matthew broderick could not have been any more perfect for this role his character is often similar bill murrays award winning role in the rushmore of the two acting jobs brodericks is far superior but even he is overshadowed the young reese witherspoon the hatred that she causes the audience develop towards her is simply indescribable broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him list of signatures making her an eligible candidate and his subtle disgust her is apparent although he tries mask it between the lines and attempts put on happy face the supporting cast is one little experience but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part however the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as young homosexual girl this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her socalled platform for presidency she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks be an unjust system is expressed if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools and gave you an innocent laugh or two then the movie achieved its goal but do not you dare think that elections goals are similar it is just as real in its portrayal of high school as its characters are in the real world there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here,1.0

confession time have never ever seen gone the wind do not know why really have not wanted check it out on video have not been at home the nights it was on network tv and it was too far drive the last time it was on the bigscreen so right up front will admit that do not know what the heck am talking about but here goes is titanic the gone the wind of the maybe that is going little bit too far as good job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie they are no clark gable and vivien leigh but the parallels are there gwtw was the first movie take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available technicolor titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design actors gwtw places americas greatest tragedy in the background of classic love story titanic does the same the atlantics most legendary tragedy they both have strongwilled redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slavessteerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular ok maybe that is not enough parallels so titanics not in gwtws league no matter titanic is great movie in its own right complete spills thrills and especially chills much has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again the money was obviously wellspent the costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only break it all on the floor as the ship sinks but writerdirectorproducer james camerons real challenge in writingdirecting producing titanic was not just costuming and set design and special effects camerons major headache was keeping the audience interested in tale where everybody knows the ending going in he succeeds masterfully cameron does two things that work incredibly well first he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic that is just titanic not the titanic mind you the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of minisub piloted treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues yearold rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in stuart does phenomenal job in brief role narrating the story of her experience stunned paxton and his roughneck crew secondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio the way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is have an allstar cast so we see the impact of the disaster on wide group of people cameron wisely chooses stick rose and jack while paying scant heed the celebrities on board the supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown there is no moment when you stop and say oh yeah know him what is he been in although would like have seen colm meaney in white star uniform or even as the illfated engineer the love story itself is rather conventional think some reviewers found it weak and that may be fair criticism the performances are the key here zane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire the hilt he is smooth he looks great in tuxedo and he is convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible at the moment when he sees little girl too frightened get aboard lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can save this little girl but can she help me get on lifeboat dicaprio is revelation had not seen him before in anything and did not know what the heck expect really honestly expected bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was bad idea so dicaprio plays poor american artist who wins ticket in poker game dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that it is hard not like him from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters winslet us character grows up lot during the movie and so does her performance at first she is not required do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous we know from the narration that she is monstrously unhappy her arranged marriage zane but there is not any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio winslet and dicaprio develop chemistry that manages propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg it is at that moment where winslet us character really comes alive faced real danger she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does splendid job as rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cals fiery temper winslet turns in superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger sheer shrieking terror of course the most interesting character is the ship itself cameron has clearly fallen in love titanic and shows her in every mood as deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captains table down in steerage and manages bring the great ship back from the dead camerons greatest gift is that he allows us fall in love titanic as well,1.0
if he doesnt watch out mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max of course there are still few big guns in this but theres some accomplished acting too although gibson continues shed his rough and gritty antihero skin as his career progresses here he explores new genre the businessman as action hero in ron howards latest gibson plays tom mullen gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair kidnappers mullen at first agrees pay the ransom but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation veteran of numerous hardnosed business negotiations the tycoon realizes that in order get his son back alive he has play his hand differently the casting is what puts this over the top the trio of gibson the kidnappers mastermind gary sinise and fbi team leader delroy lindo play off of each other wonderfully sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark his speech mullen over walkie talkie about g wells morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of society mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below feeding off the unsuspecting gibsons character is an allamerican hero few flaws his cowboy tactics tend work but they are also what got him into this situation begin in round about way if he werent known as man who s willing buy his way out of trouble his son wouldnt have been kidnapped as sinise says youre payer you did it once and now youre going do it again one of the nicest elements of this is that most of the characters actually have personalities lindo calls home talk his kids obviously shaken at working this case even the kidnappers are real people arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars gibsons breakdown on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective its one of the best filmed representations of mans world falling apart that ive seen its not all perfect the shoot em upending while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on be just that rather than provide powerful resolution as well crafted as the scene is weve seen it before mullens wife rene russo has several good moments but occasionally just seems be there while adequate brawley nolte sean doesnt provide much the other than occupying space build the story around but youll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one forget about the large coke you wont want leave for that five minute break an hour later,1.0
john cusack is the kind of actor who seems effortlessly slide into his respective roles so effortlessly that people tend forget he is there much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors anyone who can put the name james rebhorn that actors face is invited treat themselves product from one of my sponsors example the other day my mother asked me the expert of course if there were any movies out worth seeing never mind that our tastes could not be more divergent will never forget the day she recommended that go see night at the roxbury for god sakes and be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go was lot of fun it is so did not see this as anything more than futile attempt at conversation muttered little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity she responded her usual query whose in that one this is question whose answer that seems immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went see if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light sylvester stallone movie and you picture bloodbath few words and much involuntary bicep flexing and woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually of the jewish faith fretting about in some upper east side palace anyway when answered john cusack she replied rather stunned who as if it was unreasonable for her know whom was referring now know for fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but suppose it is understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most names are tougher than faces showed her picture of cusacks mug in the paper hoping for an oh him yes he is quite good instead got no do not know him at this point was way beyond frustration into realm of nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance is all it takes get me into the nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt that much of america would recognize cusacks relatively bland visage or even the name is rather bland compared the coolness of brad pitt or tom cruise onesyllable names that glide off the tongue the velocity of speeding car cusack cusack no not quite as cool am sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred as the guy from add in the cusack of your choice he is not brand name and his movies usually are not big moneymakers but in his own unassuming way he is kind of genius his pleasant common man looks and charming semiarticulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the from the sure thing say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is variation of the character before it the schlumpy every man he is constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks or woody allen and he knows how chose scripts while the stephan baldwins and val kilmers seem put them selves in everything the former actually had the insight follow up oscar winner usual suspects pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet fire his agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save for the unwatchable hot pursuit also featuring young ben stiller high fidelity is his second collaboration hit or miss english director stephan fears the grifters the hilo country and it is hit it was also cowritten cusack and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy grosse point blank it is not quite as entertaining or as funny as that but as it progresses in its meandering fashion the movie cast something of spell over me high fidelity begins as hipster ode the noncommittal rob vinyl record store owner who opens the breaking down the fourth wall much abandon and educating us in his top break ups list this is something cusack does the entire la ferris buellers day off at first the talkingdirectlyintothecameraschtick had me vaguely annoyed mostly because it reminded me so much of the body shots used similar conceit but it began grow on me due almost entirely cusacks witty delivery he is the kind of guy we do not mind talking directly us gradually the settles into shampoolike tragicomic character study of guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order figure out the true person he is yes it is all very existential though that plotline is mostly enjoyable the thing liked the most about the is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us minor characters all of whom now this is really something are terrific enough warrant their own films the best of is jack black of the very funny show tenacious a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them buy he is the kind of guy am sure we have all met before blowhard who thinks he is always right and will do anything in his power be it yell argue insult hoist his opinion onto others but like this guy because of how black plays him the actor is portly round baby face and crazy eyes but despite his size he leaps and fro like manic speed freak might be bit of redundant description seeing as how all the speed freaks know are manic he is the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films look at what that hack jan de bont did poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister but fears and black never let that happen the character for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality he is over the top but in way we can all probably relate catherine zetajones in her brief role gives vivid portrayal of women completely enamored her own charm tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as new agetype character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages work its desired comic effect the one exception in the acting department is bit of doozy the main love interest played danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace of danish accent replacing it stilted american phonation give her kudos for attempting such contradictory role but instead of being likeable she comes across as rather robotic and as such it is hard see why cusacks character would be so obsessed her especially when he has beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting in the wings this reminded me of say anything where the charming cusack was paired the charmless ione skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had put up alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheels turn little slower in fact cusack is rarely paired up personality that matches his though would bet that if laura and natasha switched roles the result would be more effective high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances fears direction is somewhat stilted and the script is sometimes little too and this is word am beginning hate use but alas must quirky for its own good think will blame that on scott rosenberg who judging from what he did beautiful girls con air and things do in denver while your dead has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie but cusack really does deserve an award for being so damn cusackian am afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have wait till his hip needs replacing be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent his character rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anything is funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can do all this and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences is something of an achievement,1.0
only year after the initial release of scream the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters while the tongueincheek parodic element is still noticeable in this it is really sideshow broader commentary on violence and the media and more conventional horror story the first while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant the premise of scream is that series of copycat killings begin when movie called stab based on book written opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening had heard about this scene before went see the and was surprised find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy its conclusion in bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it is publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else the satire in scream thus takes on broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general although resident horror geek randy jamie kennedy is back fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well everything from friends and saved the bell showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there are not any wes carpenter jokes this time more importantly this portrays characters willing go disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped what they have seen on tv and the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans use the influence of horror movies as courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show understandably scream does not go so far as actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted couple that the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense and what we have is pretty darned good horror movie in its own right we do not just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced constant fear of crazed murderer lurking around the corner while have not seen any of his other work it is easy see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing unfortunately scream occasionally reverts the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been running gag in both movies about the villain being able pull off this particular trick but it also happens other characters and in an even less believable fashion there are also few scenes in the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in situation such that he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction as for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor well it is hard say gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as lighthearted sendup scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment am not sure is the better movie but did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck,1.0
the full monty is whole lot of fun its wacky witty and original it is written and directed relatively unknowns simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo who both turned up oscar nominations how did this movie budget under million gross over million worldwide its been rumored that this may be the second most profitable movie of the year and think its about male exotic dancers and not sinking ships six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs inspired the success of chippendales production gaz robert carlyle decides they should all put on strip show make some money quickly as the six team up put on the show of their lives they run into few problems for instance dave mark addy is worried about his weight horse paul barber thinks he may be inadequate and gerald tom wilkinson is worried about his reputation and timing so when the night of the show comes will the men be able do the full monty as said before this is fun movie and not just that its really artistically good the writing and direction are great the acting is appealing all the performances have human quality them so you can relate at least one of the characters the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture left me wondering one thing why did not trainspotting get best picture nomination last year while the full monty is great lighthearted comedy it does not carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting still the full monty is great must see,1.0
the release of gattaca began wonder why all science fiction films deal destructive aliens or aliens in general has given audiences plenty of thrills those alien films but what was usually lacking was good story and good characters and good acting etc contact being the exception and for some reason has never taken look at the aliens here on earth the closest that have seen anyway was space odyssey made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed the technology they created now comes gattaca another about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet the difference between and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering using this premise writerdirector andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills unfortunately due lack of advertising fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office since seeing the have been asking people if they have seen gattaca lately however have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca most people do not even realize that it is despite this fact surely hope that the audience members who have seen this will tell their friends about it niccols deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic gattaca begins in the st century procreating is now done in petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it natural child birth is considered oldfashioned we are introduced jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program one of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have chance of weak heart as well as poor eye sight and short life span as result both parents decide bring their next baby into the world via genetics anton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns vincent has dream fly soloflight around the titan the th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him do menial labor around the company labeled an invalid vincents dream seems impossible until he meets blackmarket dna specialist german tony shalhoub german introduces him valid who has been paralized from the waste down due an automobile accident jerome morrow jude law agrees give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need get past gattacas tight security in exchange vincent will provide jerome the rent money and friendship after the murder however his dreams are put at risk due one of vincents eyelashes left at the scene of the crime irene cassini uma thurman is genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins fall in love vincentjerome gattaca is one of the best science fiction films have seen in long time only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them unfortunately whenever one intelligent comes out against special effectsladen films it normally gets buried the second best thing about gattaca is the production design jan roelfs the orange glow of gattacas scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit the sets are very well done creating futuristic sense but not too futuristic as alienate viewers as we look at the designs we realize that these buildings are not too far into the future this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible every passing day the best thing however is the plot the story is more than your average scifithriller at its heart it develops theme is never overpowering but is always present perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring would our society become bunch of soulless zombies maybe human nature is result of mankinds flaws if we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well niccols intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against dramatic story or vice versa the power of the actors brings lot of credibility flat characters while flat may sound like poor job on niccols part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story ethan hawke has developed into handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers uma thurman is well uma thurman her character is slightly underdeveloped but the story is not about her however thurman gives lot of depth the flat character jude law gives the most complex performance of the the most disturbingly realistic character he provides several nice touches and his final scene is very touching and heartwrenching one loren dean gives nice performance in his welldeveloped character dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie alan arkin portrays one of the detectives little less more excitement than his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank still he does good job gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives heartfelt discussion towards the end of the gattaca is rated pg for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire was not exactly prepared for the ending left me feeling empty it turned me off slightly but then realized that everything turned out the way it should have if this had been typical it would have ended much differently however all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice have does not talk down its audience especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters make up the genetic coding t and instead it provides some much needed entertainment gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want science fiction morals behind it whatever happened giving the audience lesson while entertaining hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca and hopefully audiences will too s personal note j gladnick how dare you call this the worst of the year cannot even begin image what you do like that frightens me beyond anything,1.0

this is the best british gangster since the long good friday jon bennet played andrew howard is an extremely good assassin as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him he has become an unquestioning weapon he is in the employ of kingpin david calder far more evil than he is but even assassins have innocent pasts he runs into an old from school days and he is married mutual girl friend from school complicating matters is that they live near where he had recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime big piece of what makes this work is the depiction of the kingpin calder is familiar actor in britain though not frequently seen in the us he was seen in the world is not enough here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years he is at once seductive and repellent like beautiful venomous snake his lair is underground apparently in sewer where he lives like the king of sewer rats it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennets life paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as cinematographer and like the kingpins lair he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness using semidarkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the visually as ominous as anything in this nether world this is world that is cold and unfriendly sorossy creates world of violence much more what we hear than what we see this is great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach we see very little but we hear great deal more and we imagine more than that the screenplay is peter waddington based on the novel neil cross but it is sarossys all the way it creates indelible images of evil rate it an on the scale and low on the scale do hope they do not use the tagline do not mess mr inbetween,1.0

i remember hearing about this when it first appeared at cannes over year ago picking up the grand jury prize at the festival holocaust comedy receives standing ovation the headlines read intrigued this statement looked up information on the and found that sure enough life is beautiful is in fact comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years even though the movie was extremely wellreceived critics and public alike could not help but be disgusted at this notion human tragedy is not something feel should be celebrated only now do see the error of my ways after finally viewing the for myself after avoiding it for some time it became clear that it is not as the headlines proclaimed holocaust comedy on the contrary life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps rather it focuses on the relationship between father and his son who he is trying desperately shield from the horrors of their situation roberto benigni who also wrote and directed the movie stars as guido orefice chaplininspired clown and all round jolly guy who as the opens is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher nicoletta braschi benigni real life spouse through the course of the first hour or so we see guido striving get the attention of this beautiful princess as he calls her employing the magic of laughter the italian comedian wins her heart and together they raise young boy named giosue child actor giorgio cantarini life treats them well until hitlers minions rise power and the family is whisked away german camp where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his sons innocence no matter what the sacrifice granted it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp but it does not pull hogans heros and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews somehow it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it is gravely serious subject so we have established that life is beautiful is not holocaust comedy but there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me the despite critics declarations of it being triumph of the human spirit is no such thing not in my eyes anyway some have called the story an affirmation of the beauty of life but say it is very dark and bleak statement about mans capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy the films ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any released recently but found it be truly discerning and upsetting essentially life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of however am not denying the movies greatness believe me it is fantastic am just saying that think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as but perhaps am reading more into the movie than is really there maybe the films brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit in fact maybe roberto benigni has made that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of movie exactly what you put into it,1.0

review dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in th century flanders living his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting spare oneroom cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens throw them out of the house if they do not pay the rent nello also has rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that have ever seen in either movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the th century not that these are the only things that make nellos life happy however he has dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is heroic rintintin of the th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master in addition he even has best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out lowerclass nello he thinks he is not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying but then he was poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the one day nello encounters mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully jon voight who tells the boy keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land career in being an artist and every christmas there is contest on is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting lot of money eager save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides become an artist asking aloise pose for him one night the two travel circus where they have their fortune told one of the films most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them she gives the kids ring whom nello places on aloises hand afterwards the two kids have rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers unfortunately things are not all ladeedah in this tale aloises father finally becomes so angry nello that he forbids him ever see aloise again bad enough that they cannot see each other although we know nello and aloise do not we but that is only the start of nellos troubles aloises farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order take revenge on being forbidden see aloise this decreases nellos reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and kindly miller william who is very sweet nello every time he drops matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has pay for his funeral but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly this means that nello and patrasche have starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind worst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails win the prize at the festival now nello and patrasche are really depressed and close freezing death will nello be able find any happiness in his life will patrasche save the day will nello make the fateful trip join his mother and grandfather in paradise dog of flanders is delightful heartwarming family that is sure entertain kids of all ages even older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised hear that this is for grownups too there have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly story about overcoming difficulties and finding good home for yourself move over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is heartwarming delight the cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds the powerful drama of the it also gives feel of being in flanders the whole was respectably shot in flanders the music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the th century the opening song over the credits is very beautiful hope the soundtrack is available and there is brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung aloise nello in another delightful scene the cast is firstrate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older not that they are the only good stars however jack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones also bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william he is another one of my favorite characters in the but jon voight as mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel he brings mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest but what makes this fun watch is how welldefined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has happy ending though will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us identify the characters for the first time since the beginning of there comes does not rely on popular formula stuff such as bigbudget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff this one relies on telling fully characteroriented story just the right amount of heart humor and drama that me is what makes dog of flanders all the more delightful eleanor osullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough welcome it for want of better word glow surrounds dog of flanders its heart is in the right place and it engages you you can guess where the is going because this is welltraveled territory but pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an oftentold story is well worth revisit in addition there were couple of other enthusiasts such as chicagosun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they are really positive other critics however were not so kind stephen holden of the new york times had more than share of beatings lay upon dog of flanders via pen writing he found the be sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voights character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up for anaconda in addition entertainment weekly slamdunked the condemning it as the worst family of the year there have been so many other bad reviews like this too my suggestion disregard the critics they just have big problem touching family films and one should never pay attention them this dog of flanders may only be little family movie it probably will not be big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other has been since then but that is not bad thing in and of itself this is story that is sure warm your heart and that is what really matters about dog of flanders it is also one of the better family films around this year none of the other films have seen this year though they were good have been so lowkey and touching if you are looking for familystyle entertainment look no further than this charming boyanddog yarn go see it while you still can for as mentioned it might not be big bowwow at the box office for long time see it while you can there is really no need compare multimillion dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant tender sweet little family movie,1.0
do critics have morals are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow naturally we do not want go into any preconceived notions is pretty tough but something we all have accomplish secondly and along the same line we cannot prejudge because of it is stars director etc the difference well in the first one we would go into thinking it is going be dumb or it is going be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so am not expecting much on the second hand we are simply assuming it will be bad or good because of personal grudge against the company it is made disney oh it is just merchandising ploy then the actors jim carreys in it it is gonna stink or the director who cannot be that good this is more of biased viewpoint as opposed first impression viewpoint make sense ok but what about comparing is not that kind of along the same lines when we compare certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one another they were involved in is that really fair sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons lot more but what about jackie brown for example is it fair for me take the review and turn it into comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both think it is and will tell you why good critic should be able view the from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the sometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but was bored or loved it it was sooooo cheezy might be used describe these are contradictions and critic has weigh both sides and come suitable balanced critique but is more important and is better an extremely well shot and acted that is boring or really amateurish that you wanna go back again and again getting back the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we are reflecting what the public wants know anyway every average person out there who is interested in this is likely ask how does it compare pulp fiction and so as critic am already responsible ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the who is likely make big comeback thanks her role as the title character tarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry and talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely happen for grier we have made it thru comparison jackie is yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fictions samuel jackson and comparison ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years help him accomplish scheme worth half million dollars trouble arises when jackie is stopped atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed naturally this proves an obstacle ordells plans and not as friendly intended as we would hope he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he is willing kill anyone who stands in the way jackie finds herself in tight squeeze ordell will not think twice about taking her out if she fails help him as she is always done yet at the same time compromise the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided it comes down simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison what ensues is rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out help the law ordell or maybe just herself coming into play is another veteran robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry maxs obvious fondness for jackie will become major benefactor in her fight beat both sides of the system and forster plays him subtle charm that adds depth unbrewed romance also involved is ordells surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv bong in hand fonda does the best she can an essentially thin role but there is nothing more her and therefore she becomes tossable addition an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters de niro is also wasted in his role as quiet nobody crook out score few bucks for himself de niro is brilliant actor but character who hardly ever speaks does not need de niro play him compared pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it would not have suffered much lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script grier specifically in mind so say that she is made for this role is reversed truth sadly grier too could have received bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life jackson teams up tarantino again but the chemical reaction is not as awesome as the first time jules was the rambling biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown do not think he is quite as irreplaceable in fact maybe new face would have been better jackson could have remained tarantinos jules and new guy could have become ordell forever remain so in our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just is not as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going deter from our fond recollections of jules another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning this is griers so why spend so long getting know man who will become more of supporting character as the progresses it not only makes the movie feel little too slanted but it makes for slow beginning because we have take longer getting the meat of the story it is likely that those pouring into the theater see this are going be those anxious partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel rum punch for those moviegoers do not expect another pulp fiction and you will be satisfied for the script oozes the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of making the directing has toned down bit however yet we are still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints so getting back the question that began this is not pulp fiction at all it is good but it is not anything that made pulp fiction such revolutionary effort in the first place this is more conservative tarantino but not one that will not satiate true fans if you can realize that this is not going knock your socks off then you will be happy at least let it massage your feet after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy,1.0

like the wonderful drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed irwin winkler is inspired true story documented physicfirst sight directed irwin winkler is inspired true story documented physician oliver sacks since awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed as sure hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama the begins as amy mira sorvino stressedout new york architect decides take some time off and travel upstate the country at the hotel she is staying at she makes massage appointment and after long soothing session ends her crying as release of emotions she strikes up conversation the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only find out later that he is actually blind amy does not really care if he has handicap or not and begins spend time him more and more until they finally start fall in love once she has returned new york amy begins research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness he has had since three years of age and out of stroke of luck comes into contact doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgils sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history at first reluctant virgil finally travels amy nyc and agrees the surgery much the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis ultimately the surgery is success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects he moves into amys apartment and she is eager stand him but virgils maladjustment begins put strain on their relationship on the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed that has been done many times before and owes great deal its predecessor awakenings what will happen throughout the can also be easily telegraphed in advance however what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy usually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort the recent tom hanksmeg ryanstarrer you have got mail immediately pops mind but this grew care more about the characters and their plight the starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil the massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly lot of chemistry between the two these joyous moments early on balanced out well the later scenes in their relationship is seriously tested due contrast in the life styles that they have always known virgil completely used being blind and having comforting peaceful life in the country amys eventful life in the big city the other major compliment that must be given the are the nearly flawless performances across the board val kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as blind person and playing his character was probably little more tricky than it appears it was up kilmer not come off as someone pity but sympathize and he pulled it off mira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash in hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for she won welldeserved oscar as kindhearted but ditzy hooker is standout here although she has made some mediocre choices since then mimic the replacement killers she always has managed come out unscathed and it is at first sight that she finally has another juicy role play in truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces kelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad onedimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character play as woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother finally nathan lane who is usually little too overthetop is appropriately restrained as vision therapist the one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil very little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible see what is being done his eyes perhaps the reason this aspect of the was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder in awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed because of how strong the screenplay written steve levitt is in the way it deals the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the films few problems can be swept over the side the adult way that the romance is depicted director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect the reallife couple that the was inspired who are still together after many years even though the setting of the was changed new york since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as refreshing and sophisticated change of pace,1.0

anyone your office for the uninitiated newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard two corporate drones who are dispatched their nameless company remote branch office for six week assignment chad and howard are archetypes examples of you can no doubt find in your own place of business chad is the blond golden boy genetically engineered for success the natural charmer who seems glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder howard is chads boss but he is weaker of will the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent we first meet them awaiting their flight in drab airport lounge there chad suggests scheme worthy of shakespearean villain he and howard will find vulnerable single woman at the branch office woo her simultaneously win her love and then dump her the reason both men have recently been dumped themselves and chad sees an easy route revenge against the fairer sex it will restore little dignity our lives he says howard helpless against the force of chads will agrees the plan they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine stacy edwards fragile deaf woman working as temp chad moves in for the kill flashing his golden boy smile plying christine lunch then flowers then dinner howard follows suit though his efforts are in contrast hamhanded and desperate flattered have the attention of two eligible men christine dates them both you can guess one she falls for soon tragic lovers triangle develops christine loves chad chad loves himself and howard loves christine on the grounds that since she is handicapped and shy she just might be wretched and lonely enough settle for him adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high does it in chad writerdirector labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed filmhannibal lector may eat human flesh but chad is an eater of souls his evil is as subtle as vipers and as easy as his smile we watch in stunned disbelief as he backstabs coworkers humiliates his subordinates and works his deadly venom into christines heart his character would be joke if he was not so chillingly real all of us have worked chad and some of us may be him he is the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness if one of his coworkers should happen go postal and walk into the office bag full of handguns he had best have his escape route clearly in mind politics is his game and the modern cubiclefilled office is his playground men wears the guise of black comedy but it functions best as allegory the most controversial moment in the happens when chad humiliates black temp asking him how badly he wants succeed in the company then forces him prove it in manner will not describe the scene is charged racism and fraught peril could it happen in the real world probably not taken as allegory however it is representative of the treatment of the meek the powerful in all facets of society maybe it is just the english major in me but chad in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard can be seen as symbol of unbridled capitalism of greed without conscience the entire is metaphor for social darwinism only the strong will survive the marvel of labutes multilayered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way but does the work as entertainment its darned funny in spots particularly in the mens room scenes demonstrate the lengths guys will go hold conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions it works less well as drama since necessity the characters in an allegory tend be flat ciphers stacy edwards gives measured dignity christine and succeeds in making us care for her but the end of the we still know nothing about her likewise chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions the end of the you will feel as if you have met genuine monster in chad perhaps we can also classify men as horror certainly those expecting conventional resolution the story will walk away disappointed but the picture is often mesmerizing and the script is work of fine craftsmanship makes it well worth your time like all good films it offers myriad of parallels the outside world while watching chad in his moment of triumph could not help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it steve jobs there may be little bit of chad in all of us but some of us have taken chadness

the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction ever made know that is very sweeping statement so will qualify it adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in speculative science is at the core of the plot space odyssey is probably better but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics be science most all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in futuristic setting the andromeda strain starts out two soldiers in hightech for van looking for crashed satellite in tiny new mexico town something bad happens them pictures from reconnaissance plane show shocking sight apparently everyone in the town is dead the authorities call wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant supersecret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada two of scientists stone and hall fly directly the town in space suits and find town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned powder in their veins some went insane before they died and two of them baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive they take the survivors and the satellite back the lab where stone pressures the white house call up directive an executive order cauterize the area around the town nuclear bomb what they find on the satellite when they get back the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earthlike life and mutates as it grows their only hope cure it is find out what perfectly healthy baby boy has in common an old derelict what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the abomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet they barely call off the bombing in time but then the organism mutates into something that threatens eat through the labs defenses and break out this triggers the labs lastditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow much of the is lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension every turn of the screw the performances are universally fine the actors keeping things lowkey and restrained just like scientists me the real appeal of this is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting we follow the logic of their deduction step methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in way we do not expect this is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way see it it was originally rated when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in bodys wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood,1.0

do you want know the truth about cats and dogs do you well as this movie shows us they make good companions but pale in comparison the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring unfortunately there is giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside feeling sorry for ourselves checkpoint beautiful kind of thing and janeane garafolos character abby relates it well like certain oversized teenage movie critic she is intelligent and has great sense of humor but strikes out the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive and the men seem be backing her up on that meanwhile her gorgeous neighbor nora uma thurman uma being the only womans name worse than nora attracts men like flies as abby tells her you burp and they think it is cute you barf and they line up hold your hair back but noras down on herself for being too shallow and superficial we all have our prwhen man calls in veterinarian abbys talk radio show wanting know how get the roller skates off his basset hound oh come on any idiot knows how handle that problem he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks meet her in person abby though knows her body does not match her personality and that she probably will not have chance him once he sees her so she gives him noras body description and stands him up nora happens be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes and abby asks her for big favor she goes along the masquerade and the three of them head out for night of fun abby assuming the role of goat cheese farmer named donna the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful she is not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person but he does not suspect anything realizing he is not living in threes company episode the charade continues abby furthering the relationship over the phone including decidedly unnecessary phone sexmasturbation sequence and nora furthering it in person while eventually finding herself attracted the dog man like sleepless in seattle this comedyromance is predictable all the way through but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance blossom the truth about cats and dogs is not quite as entertaining as was expecting it be but it handles well theme could identify the thing is find janeane garafolo rather attractive she is no uma but am sure in real life she would have no problems attracting men on the other hand could not attract man save my life and am rather proud of that fact,1.0
alien is the only alien have seen in theaters saw it when was years old and must admit that did not like it of course was expecting aliens again and believe this was my fault in order appreciate alien you need see aliens but you also have wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor james camerons aliens was an action and many people consider it the best in the series am among that group but alien is an extremely entertaining critics have bashed for its originality many thought the final chase scene went on for too long and many others thought that the was too much dialogue and not enough action both are untrue because the has quite bit of action and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten as for the chase sequence it was long but not overly long creating quite bit of suspense from confusion perhaps watching alien on video helped on the big screen was overwhelmed something normally did not see it was very dark and the language was extremely harsh had always figured the alien series rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities do not get me wrongi am not saying films should eliminate swearing but when substitutes dialogue these profane remarks it gets rather distracting however since seeing it again realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters as result alien only flaw albeit major one is the underdeveloped characters we never really care about any of them and get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order shorten the length of the movie there were only two characters liked and of course one was lt ripley sigourney weaver although we have gotten know her through two other films the other character was dr clemens charles dance but because we like him the inevitable occurs alien begins exactly where aliens left off the prologue of alien is pure cinematic achievement director david fincher who had only directed music videos before his chance this alien entry without using single line of dialogue unless you count computer warnings fincher sets up the entire an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows few seconds of before cutting title card we see lt ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments title shot of an alien egg title alien legs stretch up into the air title and so on and so on during these first ten minutes learned everything had in order for alien proceed it is quite remarkable opening and one will remain in my mind for long time because of this facehugger has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod and sent down the nearest planet fiorina fury an ore refinery has been turned into maximum security prison however the facehugger managed attach itself one of the cryotubes and is sent down the escape pod unfortunately during the landing all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed ripley is discovered some of the inmates and taken back the refinery of course you need carrier for this facehugger and it attachs itself the dog came the team of inmates ripley is revived and asks see the ship after seeing mysterious acideaten section ripley asks see the dead bodies and then have them cremated this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films featuring monologue from dillon charles dutton prisoner who has found god the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony the dogs demise it is one of the most memorable moments as the speech reflects exactly what is going on the dog and this is where alien succeeds fincher normally injects lot of symbolism into his films and can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock in fact he is the mixture of both fincher knows exactly what and how it and figure that he will be one of the few directors complete control over his films alien is riddled symbolic speeches and metaphorical images doing so fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise many people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley reveal nothing saying this as looking too fake but enjoy and relish in the portrayal showing ripley fall in slow motion is nice touch but actually not showing her hit the vat of iron great deal of symbolism is derived feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron however most people seem want witness ripley die creates paradox as she is the character did not want see die why she is killed is one of the surprises of the and do not plan on spoiling that in this review from every alien comes several memorable moments seem stick you forever in alien it was of course the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach in aliens it was the showdown between alien and ripley in machine alien has several but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley ripley is pushed up against wall and the alien stands inches away from her why it does not kill her is shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use closeups of actors faces michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style and shaving off the actors hair the only thing we have look at is their faces many critics did not like all the actors being bald but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot most of alien works when you take it in context of the story but when you try compare it its predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy and dark though that is not always bad thing the plot is pretty much rehash of the first two films some major twists again we are setup several different characters and one one they are picked off however while the first two had tons of arsenal especially camerons alien takes place on planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison as result no weapons are be found this creates lot of tension although must admit that fincher could have added lot more suspense as an alien alien is the worst of the series but itself it is an extremely wellmade motion picture lot more merits than not the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom really could care less about despite this ripley was the central figure and that is what is important we care for her even though she began act just like one of the guys again the technical side of this is remarkable and better than the two previous versions while camerons version was pumped up action massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting and moody sets the cinematography alex thomson is very well done terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around the yellows reds and oranges of the lights create dark mood and themselves create lot of suspense shadows dance on the walls and yet those shadows could easily be the alien the alien is different from its predecessors this time around and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense the camera likes take up the perspective of the alien racing after the characters the sets are quite incredible are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed the sets appear be in the future but not too far in the future one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien nothing surprising there sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens she was snubbed at the oscars for this one mainly because the was critical bomb her reactions are far more realistic in this her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter it is quite touching really charles dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates and was on the brink of actually caring for him charles dance turns in nice lowkey performance and as result cared for him immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance as bishop ii but he was more entertaining in aliens the rest of the cast is pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks out due his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world alien is rated for strong violence and language and sex although it has its flaws alien is highly entertaining rich symbolism this reminds you how much fun it is spot metaphorical images throughout movie while kubrick may have moral message throughout his films fincher relies on cinematic devices bring his meanings out it is like finchers reminds us that it is okay for sacrifice quality for quantity the final scene in fact it tells us that we as society have become too critical of things may happen look little fake whenever something looks fake on screen we immediately point it out as mistake but perhaps it is not mistake,1.0

martin scorseses kundun chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure personally do not think it needs one it works perfectly well as study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as largerthanlife symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences but his portrayal is appropriate for that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal the set design and cinematography are outstanding and while scorsese occasionally seems get carried away the spectacle it helps augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels china meet chairman mao political art sometimes succumbs the temptation start shouting slogans kundun does not it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative,1.0

though it is fine piece of filmmaking there is something about elizabeth that left me bit cold and think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days just did not care about the characters me the first and foremost job of filmmaker is create characters be they imagined or historical as the case may be that the audience gives hoot about and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of that very reason elizabeth takes place in england in as queen mary half sister of elizabeth and monarch on the side of catholicism is dying before she dies though she cannot bear sign document would condemn her half sister death because of her heretical protestant beliefs as result amidst much anger within the council elizabeth becomes the queen of england the chronicles her rise power as she fights for unified church of england and tries bring order her personal and political life much of the deals elizabeths love for lord robert mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many woman as he continues proclaim his love for the queen there is much ado about her lack of husband and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation the problem the lies this as its centerpiece as love interests are such character driven element did not much care about the characters perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well blanchett and so did not have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials the cast is rounded out well the marvelous rush who plays the queens most loyal advisor sir francis and attenborough as wellmeaning but oldfashioned lead council why then you must be asking do recommend elizabeth simply because it is the result of perfect pairing of director and cinematographer kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin neither of whom have heard create beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches cellars and castles in th century europe each frame is rich color contrasted blackness or blownout white light from windows the costumes alexandra byrne deserve mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot indeed elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade ranking kundun and braveheart watch also for the incredibly godfatheresque mass murder scene it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films,1.0

i was anxious see this for long time friend of mine recommended this me because he has crush on neve campbell and he wanted prove that she is as hot as he thinks he is he proved it for me all right but the reasons enjoy this go way beyond that scream treads on familar ground horror movie as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cannot act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door it is very familar your typical horror so why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original because it treats itself as if it has not been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff this raises another question how does it do this simple the characters they are not your typical stupid horror victims who do not know what the hell do when being chased guy in ski mask and machette they are horror fans they know how stuff happens in horror movie they know what do and what not do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times you can tell this just watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready watch video and some guy who sounds like killer calls her up play game her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed she knows what answer when he asks her horror questions she just cannot answer his final question what door am at and that gets her killed that scene works because in normal horror half the things that happen in that scene would never happen the plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student who is mother was killed year ago tommorrow is being stalked killer who is previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is suspect including sidneys boyfriend billy loomis but as said before these people know how horror movies work and that is what makes it so appealing that and the references horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked is obviously director wes craven who does good job of poking fun of the genre that made him legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidneys friend mentions the director wes carpenter is obviously an homage writer kevin williamson not only craven but also director john carpenter the cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off good heroine and unlike most horror heroines she can act drew barrymore does good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the and david arquette is impressive also good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal took half point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidneys rival because she covered her mothers disappearance hate that show hate those actors they are untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and would think wes craven is smart enough know those actors are overexposed enough but suppose he is not,1.0

contrary the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced some cold hard politics it is actually three movies in one political boxing and love story all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal we have seen it all before and we are just not blown away it like we should be oh well it is still an excellent irish story the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel daylewis an exira member who gets out of belfast prison after years and finds out that his troubles are far from over first off the ira is having small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its subleaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail while this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyles shallow grave reopen an old gym allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics work together danny not only begins teaching kids how box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready start boxing real people again and danny runs into his exlove maggie breaking the waves emily watson who has not seen him since he went in they do not easily start up their romance again because she is the wife of prisoner whom she married during dannys tenure in prison and also has son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon but the two are slowly redrawn eachother again and this begins complicate things the political story is nothing really special but works in itself we have seen it many time before but it is at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times there is big riot towards the middle of the is frightening in its brutality and honesty the boxing story is very minor the story but does represent people coming together fight eachother fairly and even good sportsmanship there are only few boxing scenes but they are never like raging bull let usstripdownthesporttoitsbones brilliant they are more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother is slightly unerving at times and did not know daniel daylewis was in such good shape but the backbone of the story is the love one because these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight as the goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have make real human decisions and we can sympathize them as humans not characters this is how you write love story take note these elements are pretty much equally balanced each of the parts of the stories working handinhand eachother loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next it made sure that we did not just care for one of them am not saying they are all equally great because the love story really carries the but at least they all work out respectively the acting is amazing daylewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry am not sure if they are oscarnominee bound but they are very good in the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers but the is stolen acting wise ken stott as ike who is just great scene stealer the direction and cowriting jim sheridan the other cowriting credit going terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls at quick pace and ends much too quickly more time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy though the boxer is good it never achieves the greatness that it should sure it is masterpiece compared most of the drivel we usually get but on it is own it just could have been better but it still works out gives us great love story combined political and boxing drama and features great acting even if it could have been better thisll do,1.0

for example in happy gilmore sandler plays rookie golfer trying beat selfconfident jerk of pro if the star were any other comic that would be enough motivation drive the movie but sandler the rookie also wants win the prize money help his grandma keep her house that extra motive does not make happy gilmore funnier movie it does not really add any genuine emotional depth either in fact the motive is almost totally irrelevant the movie but sandlers philosophy seems be if it is token gesture why not make it nice gesture that is endlessly refreshing in the wedding singer sandler is right on track the fact that he is wedding singer is only superficially relevant the story what kind of wedding singer he is is even less important david spade could have filled the role cynicism and sarcasm he could make fun of the fat ugly or embarrassing people he meets at weddings and the story would be intact but sandler instead brings mature goodness the character he seems really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family robbie hart sandler does not just sing at weddings he also gets the loners join in and have fun and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding the day comes when robbie has his own wedding and he is stood up his heavymetal bride the movie is set in robbie takes it hard he does not sleep he does not eat and he gets punched out at work when he sings love stinks at wedding julia drew barrymore who waitresses all the weddings in town gives him shoulder cry on and an ear talk eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia he really likes her but she is engaged her fianc is selfconfident jerk do see trend nope just formula who does not deserve her but robbie is too depressed fight for her hand julia seems like robbie too but she cannot leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc for the offchance that robbie might be serious about her you know the story you have seen it million times before there is always new way tell it new lovers new chemistry and new details but it is the same story and sometimes it works the wedding singer works first of all the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective actually it is not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each ones own romantic tension sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of jilted man struck an unattainable love barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious settle down sparks do not fly when they kiss but they both seem right for each other second their love is mature they are not driven passionate sexual attraction they are cute couple but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material instead they are both looking for someone meaningful someone settle down someone grow old at wedding robbie comforts kid throwing up in dumpster while julia sits the repulsing situation is taken in stride as if the two were already parents caring for their sick child the soundtrack and references play big part in this movie other critics liked this movie in part because of the soundtrack liked it in spite of the soundtrack often the music and references felt forced for example robbie tells his exfianc get out of my van halen tshirt before you jinx the band and they break up ha ha ha get it david lee roth did leave van halen or how about when sammy allen covert robbies chauffeur friend shows up at party wearing michael jackson jacket and get this single silver glove that is exactly what mj used wear all the time unfortunately making fun of generalizations about past era is too easy be rewarding that is not say the movie is not funny screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before billy madison and happy gilmore and the two make good combination herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script his straightfaced smartaleck style let us hope herlihy and sandler stick together for few more projects because this movie really won me over barrymores charm and sandlers heart it was hard go wrong,1.0
when it is cold molecules are not moving everything is clean these are the essential words of mikey carver elijah wood young teenage boy living in new canaan connecticut in the ice storm when mikey delivers these words bored science class it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikeys life and the lives that surround him his father jim jamey sheridan is rarely seen and his mother janey sigourney weaver is having an affair married neighbor ben hood kevin kline bens wife elena joan allen suspects the affair but does not say anything meanwhile bens yearold daughter wendy christina ricci continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy adam hannbyrd into sexual explorations tobey maguire plays paul hood the yearold narrator of the story who also happens be the least prevalent character we start the an interesting outlook on family from paul he compares family the fantastic four comic book and even goes so far as say that family is everybodys own antimatter something everybody will return eventually and the farther you go the deeper you will return the ice storm is character piece that explores dismal time both in america and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie everything parallels everything else the young teenagers trying discover who they are thru drugs sex and alcohol is really almost identical the parents trying figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods when it is cold outside the molecules are not moving everything is clean everything is clean because nobody will admit what is going on even the president is on tv denying his wrongdoings how can you expect anything more out of couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty and think that is the point of the at first viewing the entire movie might seem empty but then why should not it parallel itself you do not get know the characters very deeply but think that is because nobody in the movie knows each other either we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious one another at first glance you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you have not gotten know the characters well enough sympathize then you realize that just might be the point and then you do feel the pain the acting all is quite good but particularly liked elijah wood he does not seem be receiving as much recognition as the others but still found him possess quite real sense of being christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more her life in the pants of every available boy still say hats off remain wood joan allens subtle but believable performance as lonely unappreciated wife and the always excellent kevin kline tobey maguire did fine job but his character perhaps was the most intact sensible person in the story seemed little lost he was needed but perhaps he should have been used more the ice storm is being hailed many as one of the best films of the year hate say that do not agree but do not in fact can think of many other films that would rank higher than this one even so it is very good it takes lot of retrospect fully appreciate it is art but when you finally start seeing things in it that you did not before you start grow even fonder of the characters and the story perhaps this is one see ponder and then watch again different eyes,1.0
the end of the affair is dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs although it is slow and sometimes confusing follow it still manages give audiences moving experience based on graham greenes novel of the same name the mainly follows characters there is maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair henry miles stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore sarah finds henry be bore because well he is just normal guy it is all work and no play him while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love sarah and would do anything for her unfortunately the two break up this is all witnessed in serious of flashbacks so that leads us the present it is few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires private detective ian hart see what sarah is up too while this may sound straight forward it is not it is deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love all this may sound like drag but it really captures your interest great performances ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why the story was also well written thanks neil jordan even though did not read the book there is no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive what is so moving about it you ask the tragedy of it all it is not the typical romance in guy finds girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing it really shows the complexity of relationship because nothing is ever perfect everyone feels different way and that is what tears us pieces back neil jordans script it was not only red roses there were times when felt it too be little slow but most romances are it also tended be bit confusing especially at the start it keep jumping around from past present so it obviously took awhile get grasp of things also notable was the superb direction neil jordan would have say this is his finest achievement date because quite frankly have never really found his work be up par it just never did anything for me until now when it ends it leaves viewers little saddened but provoked nonetheless this is definitely one of the best films of and had some of the best acting most notably moore not for all movie goers but for those who are buffs and want something of value,1.0
titanic is without doubt the best movie have seen all year and believe me am not an easy critic impress the english patient was too long men in black was overhyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water thank god this got delayed until december it is my christmas present titanic is in the tradition of the old epics of yearsgoneby and it is truly stunning while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch see how much longer it is gonna last despite its hour plus running time as friend of mine who is true titanicbuff said if someone does not like this it is because they did not want truer words are hard come of course it does not hurt that this comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time if you wish argue that point me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator true lies etc still care disagree not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this he also wrote produced and edited it and show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points ease the budget costs it is obvious he truly loves titanic the opens footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion special submarines the bottom of the atlantic where team of explorers lead bill paxton are searcing for diamond called the heart of the ocean according bill paxtons character would be worth more than the hope diamond today their search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead drawing of young woman wearing the diamond this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen year old woman named rose who claims be the girl in the picture she is flown out sea meet bill paxton and tell them about the diamond almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past roses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she did not want marry her mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant they are boarding the titanic is sailing america and this is where she is marry cal meanwhile young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in poker game they are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving for them this is their ticket america better life for rose she is sailing her doom the first hour and half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love it is the classic wrongsideofthetracks story and does sometimes resort few cliches but as said above the love portion is not sappy and does not weigh the down as some critics have said it is sweet and it did not make me restless at all despite the fact that usually hate love stories of course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters help keep our eyes glued the screen most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in including the enigmatic molly brown played the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on all of these characters add an extra depth the and make it that easier watch of course things really start get going after the hour and half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins slow sink the bottom the sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing it is not told in heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths the best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back the future the crew who at first had been skeptical of roses story now are totally aborbed her rose goes out onto the ships ledge and we then learn secret about her that catches us off guard we then see dream of roses in she returns the titanic and is dancing jack dawson most people talked after the movie saw this as only dream however think it symbolized more think it meant that rose had died and is going sort of heaven would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack if anyone has seen the movie and would like voice an opinion about this email me at venomhotmail com,1.0
sometimes you just have tip your hat sometimes you just have jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride saw the truman show an audience full of teenagers most of whom were no doubt drawn ace ventura himself and hoping see his latest take on fart jokes surprised they may have been when they realized that this picture actually had something say but the attentiveness of the crowd would say they were won over as was i cannot tell yet if truman really is that good or if it only seems that good in comparison the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of so far this year time alone will make that call but the end of the we were all on truman burbanks side we were concerned for his wellbeing and wanted him win that we felt as we did is tribute both the and jim carrey who has achieved legitimacy at last the truman show is best viewed cold as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot unless you are under media blackout however you probably know the basics carrey stars as truman burbank capraesque everyman insurance agent living his beautiful wife meryl laura linney in the south florida island town of seahaven looks like michael eisners idea of the perfect american small town truman would seem live the perfect middle class lifestyle complete working wife best bud friendly neighbors and interesting coworkers there is tragedy in his past his father drowned in horrible boating accident leaving truman dreadful fear of water and of travel in general but overall life is good but then one day as truman leaves his house for work klieg light falls magically from the sky this curious event may lead truman discover what the rest of the world already knows that he is prisoner on the worlds biggest soundstage that his wife friends and relatives are all actors paid interact him and that his life has for over days been broadcast as the worlds most popular television program what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed niccol and weir the soundstage we are told is only the second manmade structure visible from space trumans movements are tracked ceaselessly cameras scattered throughout the town button cams dashboard cams mirror cams wife cams big cams and small cams weir cuts the so we are never quite sure if we are watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show is omnipotent creator christof ed harris who oversees the show from control room built into the manmade moon in seahavens sky the second act offers plethora of clues for truman as the truth of his existence his best friend marlon noah emmerich always has six pack of beer him his wife seems exist in an eternal commercial in she is always endorsing the latest hot household product he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town one wonders why he did not pick up on any of this earlier but christof has an answer for this people tend accept the reality they are presented nevertheless truman begins grow restless and dreams of escape fiji where an old college sweetheart natasha mcelhone supposedly lives this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is magical and provocative concept the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way underplaying truman he allows the subtle manipulations of the take over there is particularly poignant scene in truman confides his fears marlon and marlon answers bestfriend sincerity would gladly step in front of bus for you but that line was fed marlon through an earpiece christof the abject cruelty truman is subjected hits home and from that moment we are on his side the truman show derives much of its success from playing our own secret paranoid fantasies have not we all at least once doubted our place in the world doubted the sincerity of those closest us ultimately however the picture rises above its own artifice raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator what does god really think of us does he resent our abandonment of paradise who exactly is watching us up there in the sky if you enjoy the picture as much as did credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay work as for carrey well truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born play carrey is no jimmy stewart his credit he does not try be he just tries feel the way you or would if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us,1.0
i did not realize how apt the name of this movie was until called the mpaa the motion picture association of america the folks who decide what is nc pg or ask why the preview was rated so that we can make some sense of their response let me tell you about the movie itself the celluloid closet is documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades it is brilliant funny naughty and extremely poignant it tore at my heart watch gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that as rule gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen regardless of how veiled or how sordid the presence of gay or lesbian person allows others lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they are not quite so invisible as america seems want them be the movie itself is rated and for good reason it contains scenes of bloody violent gay bashing and graphic uninhibited sex as any movie appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time so can decide for myself whether see the movie friend date my year old niece alone or not at all but that is the movie now back the preview prior this being theatrically released it was originally filmed as documentary for hbo had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times there was no nudity no violence no bad language nothing that could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for general audience okay whoopi goldberg did refer someone boning someone but the last knew that was not one of the seven words you cannot say on tv except for scene of two fully clothed men kissing hmmmmm when inquired about the rating on the trailer very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from the handbook that trailer approved for all audiences could contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone hello was in the office and it was the middle of the day bravely pursued have seen that trailer oh probably half dozen times gulped and do not remember that scene well she chirped it is there our little eyes are trained see that no really in the words of dave barry am not making this up they are trained see that when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made note watch it carefully the following five times or so managed let it slip past her gosh certainly do not mean question the mpaa or the handbook would however like suggest that it is they who are in the closet on this one and the light as not good in there but having seen the celluloid closet and being one of handful of straight people involved in primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study email me and will give you the details none of this was any big surprise the point of the movie was that homosexuality even in the politically correct is ridiculously perceived as threat mostly heterosexual society point well made in this candid and honest now could go off on the mpaas ruling that trailer must contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and ask how that is defined particularly in light of some of the things both sexual and nonsexual that have watched straight people do in trailers just do not feel the need go there because it seems so obvious will instead suggest that the mpaa reevaluated their evaluation criteria let the ratings reflect not subject content like sex and violence let them reflect attitude content in the future would be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated for disrespectful or for stereotyped then would truly be able make an informed decision about how spent my time,1.0
minutes not rated though suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language mamoru oshii is name that probably is not very wellknown most american audiences but perhaps it should be oshii was the director of last years bestknown japanese animated import _ghost in the shell_ and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films deep philosophical bent one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series in its many incarnationsgraphic novels manga two different runs of madeforvideo episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and television series running nearly fifty episodespatlabor has proven be one of the most popular series ever in japan set in the very near future though it was somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus as whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan as the prologue each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century the rise of labors however has come new menacelabor crime this led the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors fight labor crime the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv who through no fault of their own have acquired bad reputation for destructiveness sometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life those who are unfamiliar the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers the story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization however the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead shinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency this hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over of the nations labors including the patrol labors of sv since that installation dozens of labors including heavilyarmed military model have begun go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos some wags have compared this windows it is up asuma shinohara labor command officer sv and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries find the source of these problems before more laborsincluding svs ownfall victim them and before hos drags his fathers company down it as was the case _ghost in the shell_ if you just want nobrainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you _patlabor the movie_ is more of psychological thriller technological suspense drama it is closer perhaps chrichton novel than an action movie crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding there are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar sequences from _ghost in the shell_ this movie is fraught symbolismin fact large part of it is based on christian symbolism patlabors nearfuture setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar our own present day the uses this setting make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans keep up are history and culture falling the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced new this is question just as applicable today as it is patlabors alternate setting as far as the technical aspects of the go referring the subtitled version as that is the only one have seen the transfer is clear almost phenomenally so the animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used the oavs and tv series were more cheerful bettersuited humor the movie however makes everyone look great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going be for the most part deadly serious storyline as far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in _patlabor the movie_ do not think can recall ever seeing fisheye perspective used in any other animated save for _ghost in the shell_ another oshii or indeed in many other movies at all the cinematography is wellsuited the storyline emphasizing what it needs though couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange western audiences the audio track of _patlabor the movie_ is in glorious hifi stereo and should be used demonstrate home theater systemsit _is_ that good even without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard _come_ from that side giant robot footsteps are deep and booming the sometimesunderstated sometimesblaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created the animated scenery as far as the subtitles go have say that they are among the most easilyreadable subtitles have ever seen for _anything_ large enough that they do not strain the eyes but small enough not conceal too much of the screen although it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie although it is superblyrealized it relies in large part upon prior familiarity some of the characters carry the story and that could detract from some peoples enjoyment my,1.0
okay let me first say this is beavis and butthead movie if you do not like beavis and butthead do not go see this movie however if you do like them recommened you get out right now and go see it the movie starts off the boys wondering what happened their tv they notice that it has been stolen and they vow find it this wind their way through america searching for dallas she is woman they look for her because as they are searching for the tv they find drunk who wants them do his wife well of course they think he wants them score her when actually he wants them kill her and the fun starts their this movie is mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how keep pace even when they were crawling through the desert and thought the movie started lag he manages keep the laughs coming if you expecting changes from the show keep looking the same character the same voices the same everything from the show and that is what makes it good you might think movie from tv show you can change few things often times this spells disaster for films because the makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place,1.0
taking few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers the story centres around group of people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters everything from sex drugs violence is covered in much blacker edge in comedy than swingers although qts touch is evident in nearly every frame go is entertaining enough forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride liman who also photographed the has deft touch the camera and the looks good the also seems have benefited from budget the nightclub scenes in particular looking pretty good there is twisted sense of humour running throughout ensures that even the darkest scenes get smirk the young cast are talented and help bring the story life holmes one of the dawsons creek cast show am not particularly fond of displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages make three dimensional character and never becomes caricature askew is slightly successful being rather obnoxious no doubt the filmmakers intended this make the audience cheer when what happens him but instead of funny annoying he is just annoying he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer who gives an nice evil performance the script written john august is sharp and witty good dialogue and some funny jokes it starts off rather slow however but in about twenty minutes the script has found it is footing and just keeps getting better the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally there is too much attention on one detail but not on another also some of the endings seem little forced and lucky still the cast have meaty script get into and obviously enjoy it it could of tried little harder in some parts however and these parts lag because this is genxer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and gos one is pretty decent unlike other genxers movies go never allows the music substitute for plot or dialogue is plus go is very easy movie absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine in things hate about you they are who they are and they stay that way go is great fun and worthy follow up from the director of swingers ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride erm go go guess,1.0

full metal jacket very much like every other hardhitting about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america this is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of young man private joker played matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp these sequences are considered be the best part in this three act even though found the later portions be equally stunning as in platoon full metal jacket gets off quick start the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits is getting their heads shaved from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well the former drill instructor lee ermey apparently the solution was found for the perfect man play drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected such horrible situations private joker gets off on the wrong foot the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent donofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle sgt hartman the is continually narrated private joker in he explains his visions on what is going on the entire corps although repeatedly hammered sgt hartman continues on private pyle however seems be the rag doll for the drill instructor he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop that is until sgt hartman comes up new plan he will punish the rest of the soontobemarines for pyles goofups even after joker was assigned help him out in the best way he can pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take turn for the worst pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of marine after graduation joker is sent over the height of the action in order document the war is his service he is not member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat when he sets out on documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start joker joins up platoon along his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way he also soon finds himself in position in he must fight or die again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as whether it is an antiwar or not few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you decide full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of young man in vietnam as have others in the past this in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion one thing is for sure however no one ever wants experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected unfortunately many did,1.0
oliver stones latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents it is threehour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the th century stone does not hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done at the same time he creates very human character brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics is here pictured as wild animal he is simply trying tame it but the occasional switch the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the presidents ability control them stone does not in any way apologize for nixon he blames not only nixons own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself the system that once set in motion behaves mindlessness of its own nixon is modern shakespeare story saga about ruler destroyed his fatal flaws there is something almost majestic about the process as nixon goes down in this there is no gloating but watery sigh as of great ship sinking sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon incredible honesty and understanding creating very emotional picture of the th american president joan allens magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette she is strong and loyal as mrs nixon the rest of the cast is equally magnificent including james woods t walsh paul sorvino ed harris and bob hoskins everyone does serious and demanding job no one are disappointing stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy honest and determined he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element at times he is showing black and white showing flashbacks from nixons youth and childhood the flashy editing brian berdan and frank corwin robert richardsons rich cinematography and john williams musical score create hectic and bizarre atmosphere the films only fault is that it is bit tiering and overloaded too much political material and legal maneuvers still it is an honest and captivating solid piece of movie making,1.0
in tim burtons sleepy hollow there is mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name he rides beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims an immediate swipe burtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror writer andrew kevin walker seven throws in perhaps too healthy dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring examine as sleepy hollow opens we are greeted juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burtons ed wood landau plays prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated an unseen horseback rider after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in investigate landlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is dead hessian trooper played briefly wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods crane is not man of great superstition and is determined root out the human culprit his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things was not surprised find in tim burton movie first and foremost sleepy hollow is fun horror as virtually all burton movies we are treated wonderful score composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly the horseman fx are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors but why did enjoy sleepy hollow as much as did although enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right it was the light comic touch that burton applied the has the sweetness of candy apple usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities this is certainly not the only alteration that is been made as the progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience it is not an issue we particularly wish be solved it is more effective for the headless horseman be an elusive demon than an elusive demon an ulterior motive still we are still captivated the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye capture our attention the costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout it is recognizable that the script was refined awardwinning playwright tom stoppard the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent walken michael gough who appeared in burtons batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down ruthless accuracy all of this is not be taken seriously of course sleepy hollow is lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of classic tale that many people cherished as children if you have got decent head on your shoulders you will have the good sense gallop off the theater and enjoy it one last time,1.0
ok admit had bad attitude about this from the start romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure yuck but it is not really too bad it has lot working against it for me at least in addition the above it is typical of lot of recent movies in that it is really just glorified madefortv movie but longer and bigger stars and you have pay see it it does win you over though even if it is painfully predictable just think about it two single parents their cute kids are thrown together due missed field trip through day of near disasters they cont inually meet get in one anothers way cause trouble for one another and generally insult one another at every opportunity in fact they hate each other so much that we know that they are or soon will be in love the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples so this is predictable just as the screwball comedies of the classical cinema were predictable and the screwball genre is obviously hoffmans model for this will they get fired from their yuppie jobs will they make the big soccer game that is so important their kids will pfeiffer realize what jerk her exhusband drummer for bruce springsteen really is are not they all will they finally kiss well what do you expect but there is certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled especially when it is done as much humour along lack of sticky sentimentality as it is in this pfeiffer and clooney have certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed steal the show one word of caution though this is being billed in some places as family movie do not let that stop you however think most kids especially boys would be pretty bored this move after all nobody gets killed and there are no explosions all in all good nonoffensive date movie the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice,1.0
bowfinger is good movie about the making of very bad one the screenplay written costar steve martin skewers everything in from cheesy sciencefiction movies chopsocky fight sequences and all in crafty and accomplished manner anyone who knows of or has had any association moviemaking should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it is entire duration the central premise behind the is an inspired and promising one bobby bowfinger martin cheapskate and smalltime producer has always dreamed of making successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools do so new script an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain has caught bowfingers eye after confronting bigname producer named jerry renfro robert downey jr in restaurant an agreement is made finance the movie but first bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey eddie murphy sign in on the project kit turns the offer down immediately but bowfinger still has the intent shoot the after emptying out his life savings the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved and then prepares the movie without the stars knowledge the actors confront ramsey on the street saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes capture the footage the unknowing star who is terrified of aliens and being abducted is brought believe there is actually pod people after him when the conditions become even more treacherous bowfinger is forced hire kit ramsey lookalike named jiff also murphy sweetnatured dork who runs for coffee inbetween shooting vital scenes these include attempting suicide run across an lane freeway and one of the hot scenes involving supporting actress daisy heather graham removing her blouse bowfinger takes it is sweet time getting started but when the plot switches into high gear great things happen certain scenes are so precisely executed perfectly framing moments that are absolutely falldown funny no hilarious standouts include the chase through parking garage in ramsey who is supposed be being followed keeps checking behind him investigate strange tapping noise it is actually bowfingers dog in high heels and just try not laugh in the climactic kungfu sequence featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas while the entire minutes of bowfinger is not always on target individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles masterful comedy director frank oz dirty rotten scoundrels in and out who has never made bad movie ensures quality final product and is aided immensely martins sharpedged script however the real onscreen star is eddie murphy this is the actors finest work since his breakthrough into the market in the early murphy excels at every corner not only succeeding presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey but in creating likable buffoon in jiff as well these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise and the reward is virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger but murphy fuels it this is summertime comedy that unlike something such as american pie and south park does not break any rules but it is still just as uproarious or perhaps even more sidesplitting than anything we have seen this season the supporting cast including christine baranski as workloving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman all perform well within their limits the only presence that demands real attention when placed next martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham as the young star who has plans sleep her way the top graham attempting further her stardom after appearing as the new powers girl in ap displays cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds the wackiness of the screenplay would not be caught dead buying ticket for chubby rain but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough,1.0
pulp fiction quentin tarantinos anxiously awaited and superb followup reservoir dogs is absolutely and without doubt progressing as one of the most talked about loved and hated films of alltime in all fairness it should be noted that those who love this greatly outnumber those who hate it as if reservoir dogs was not perfect tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection creating pulp fiction fastpaced hard talking roller coaster ride of movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in seemingly perfect way every major character in this is represented terrific acting performance the actor begin the two hit men vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield samuel jackson these two characters work together perfectly and the performances each actor are nearly perfect travolta in fact is still trying get out of the vincent vega role if these two characters were not enough there is the struggling boxer butch coolidge bruce willis the two smalltime criminals pumpkin tim roth and honey bunny amanda plummer the big man in charge marsellus wallace ving rhames and his attractive young wife mia uma thurman and the problem solver himself the wolf harvey keitel these are just the major characters smaller roles but equally terrific are handed jimmie quentin tarantino young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business lance eric stoltz the farout drug dealer as well as maynard duane whitaker and zed peter greene two hillbillies who are the men behind no pun intended for those of you who have seen this very disturbing scene towards the end of the the interweaves three stories that at first seem be nothing alike but later prove be very critical each other the begins pumpkin and honey bunny in small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and holdups the two quickly decide hold up the coffee shop unknowing of what lies ahead after this the focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment terrorize the occupants the two men were sent the apartment recover mysterious briefcase for their boss marsellus wallace after basically toying the men especially the unfortunate brett frank whaley vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase this is not before man jumps out from bathroom hand cannon shooting at the two gangsters he somehow completely misses them leading jules cite divine intervention this is also the basis for more of the nowfamous tarantino dialogue the then shifts focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades butch was ordered take fall in his latest fight but when he does not marsellus vows find him wherever he is and make sure that butch is not able enjoy his new fortune vincent meanwhile has the honor of taking marsellus wife mia out on date while the big man is out of town vincent obviously is rather nervous about this especially after hearing the tale about man who was thrown out of window for supposedly giving mia foot massage after their date seems rather smoothly things take turn for the worst at the hands of vincents highpriced heroin dubbed monster lance each story continually progresses and new and amazing events occur eventually the stories all meet each other in the end pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant happens contain both vincent and jules pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade and possibly of alltime along its superb dialogue action writing directing and acting this will not only latch onto you but it proves that it does not want release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you and most fans of this movie this is proved be rather easy task although at times the graphic images violence and language may seem bit overpowering surely quentin tarantinos fame was greatly escalated this and he proves not be one who will fade from existence very soon,1.0
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not am fan of the xfiles first let me assure you that no prior experience the series is required fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have reach for larger audience therefore the movie is quite userfriendly altough nonfans will only fail understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no am not fan of the xfiles only watch it when nothing else is on and prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend took that opportunity test the movie taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie am glad report that learned nothing new everything you need know is explained the viewer duchovny and others know am going maybe bit too far make my point but everybody should get the chance experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the xfiles is what summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of wooden plank from start finish this movie does not let go of you when compare it last summers movies the best way describe it would be take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time monster scared me that much was when first saw aliens as six year old kid you know when you are affraid put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying cover your throat your shirt so yeah the xfiles is scary and guess what you never even have see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having watch flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the xfiles is monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the xfiles is definately mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has couple of good scenes duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get do much no this is mulders time in the spotlight now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then will not spoil it for you let us just say that due recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there them when they open door or climb hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose if you are confused something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also those people who need go the bathroom during movies do not the person who watched the movie me had go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the xfiles does not need fill scenes between the suspense and the action useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves purpose who needs see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies would recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins nose but the truman show is not what would call summer movie the xfiles is what more do you ask from summer movie other than the chance be excited cool effects it is good some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have good time it does not provide answers the show is many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half star well swore never give movie the full five stars so had find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it is pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles give the appearance that mulder had been driving for long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving,1.0
i know it already opened in december but finally got around seeing rushmore last weekend and it was one of those rare oppritunites that got leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price as the final scene closed out in happy slowmo fashion felt happy have been priveleged enough watch such good display of filmmaking jason schwartzman his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses steals the show as max fischer the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades but compensates for it organizing most of the schools clubs and organizations e the fencing team and writing and producing school plays and often pulling outrageous stunts one that eventually earns him an expulsion this stunt building an aquarium on the schools baseball diamond is plot steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross olivia williams he funds this aquarium the help of millionare herman blume very oscarworthy bill murray who eventually finds himself falling in love miss cross rosemary and herman begin datingand the fun begins herman and max go at it head head in battle for miss cross herman manages destroy maxs bike while max cuts hermans brakes and it goes on like this but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross and he cannot stand in the way of two people in love the academy of arts sciences really messed up this year they completely overlooked rushmore and if you ask me it was not an accident it maybe was not best picture material but it certainly deserved screenplay nod instead of elizabeth and bill murrays absense from the ballot is complete snub the entire mood of the is one reason it is so good at one point it is fun and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling as well hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs and be enjoyed intelligent goers,1.0
capsule this is that avoids easy answers wilhelm furtwangler then the worlds greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated the nazis what were his views was he war criminal or secret resistance fighter how much did he know about crimes against humanity the us government investigated him after the war and this is dramatization of that investigation high in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabos sunshine that covers the fortunes of jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes hungarian aristocrats nazis and communists szabos followup german production is much more limited in scope it is about the postwar investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them ronald harwoods screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich maj steve arnold played harvey keitel has been assigned his superiors investigate wilhelm furtwangler stellan skarsgard perhaps europes greatest classical music conductor when other artists fled germany furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen after the war is over arnold assigned interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate prosecute him for war crimes he secretly is told his commanding officer find furtwangler guilty from there we follow him and learn little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point conspiracy against his investigation there is certain sameness the responses that he is getting perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed if so perhaps he can never come the truth in large part the is about mind games that arnold uses manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous it has no obvious resolution and not much of final act when it is over whether anything has been established is open interpretation perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all obvious what the audience should believe but it is like watching murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is we are given clues something but they are never tied up in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler the is basically stage play the visual is not very important corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows photographs avoid having shoot on location as stage play what this centers on the dialog and that is intriguing rate the an on the scale and high on the scale there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice at one point we clearly see arnolds desk calendar say jan tues quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in and then not again until the events had take place in or possible date could be obtained from any world almanac,1.0

when left the theater after seeing david lynchs lost highway remarked fellow moviegoer feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears in his first feature in five years lynch delivers second only his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale you will not know what happened when it is over though there are certainly enough clues make some reasonable guesses it is difficult describe the plot of this because it depends partly on how you interpret it can however describe what we see on the screen a jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep they are naturally enough more than little frightened and confused and it does not help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at party and proceeds call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving the next morning fred finds another videotape his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom he is convicted of her murder and sent death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins intersect fred in number of ways most notably his affair alice wakefield arquette again blonde who is otherwise renees spitting image and another encounter the mystery man would be giving away little too much reveal any more but suffice it say that lynch does not offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning end this description might make lost highway sound like giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynchs weird sense of humor this is anything but giddy most of the time on the contrary lost highway is dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynchs previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther the does not revolve around character investigating mystery rather the character is the mystery there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the that seem indicate deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goingson here we the audience are left puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably freds in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant represent all of this proceeds appropriately in lynchs typically slowpaced idiosyncratic style as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly there are scenes when the camera lingers on freds blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coils song the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present vivid picture of man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity lynchs direction and director of photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve create nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story well most of the time anyway have admit that was bit bored at times during the section of the pete dayton as the protgaonist is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewers attention because of its tieins the original mystery the main characters in this reality dayton wellmeaning but none too intelligent yearold sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much stock character and his pornstar girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you could not find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help preserve the films spooky unnerving tone during this stretch lynchs typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here it is not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off that said these minor flaws do not prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films hit the screens in recent years it is oneway ride down the lost highway of disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective,1.0

i am not really sure what think about crash on the surface it is cold boring unerotic porn name starts name director and some cool camerawork mean it left me completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out but then again not every films supposed leave you entertained crash is structured play like porn flick but significantly more plot and dialogue while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair of characterization not mention the acting is generally pretty good and we do not really see lot of the actors completely exposed but what makes it supremely different from porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience this does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that have seen it if one was be made completely hot this it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing the leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present group of people who live on the edge the opens up on woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against car in public air hangar suddenly man enters the frame and begins take her from behind the doesnt show all this though even if it is nc the next scene has director james james spader having sex camera woman alice poon in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie the next scene has the two coming together revealing us that they are husband and wife and them sharing in one anothers escapades while the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love live on the edge soon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course he is reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on james is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in porn also alive the two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again when james gives her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go an unbusy parking lot and have little quickie as they were aroused the accident you would not think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutchcarrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it vaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it another level he loves recreate famous car crashes in one scene he and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get rush and the attention of the police soon these five are all having sex one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex while this is admittingly all bit comical the is almost like black comedy the does do pretty awesome portrayal of people who is main fetish is living on the edge am sure somewhere there are people who get aroused car accidents but personally do not see connection between car crashes and sex the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give definite rush his car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces we are at first not sure if they will take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp then when it happens we hold our breath the same thing happens sex although not in the same fashion these people are merely taking it another level the only problem the is that it is tad redundant normal porn lasts from an hour an hour and half this goes on for about minutes and it just seems little too long the sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are tad on the boring side there is no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey it is porn and we are not here sympathize but still they coulda cut it down bit but the is saved its presentation as well as some other elements the atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating kind of cool weird feeling and there are several scenes are just amazing one scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being man sounds almost erotic the way she says it sequence involving one characters death is filled all the edgy disjointment that the needs and the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of car crash and couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that she is wounded the acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in porn while james spader is pretty boring he is usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing she speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes and when she is having sex she has blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether she is enjoying it or not in one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex her holly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds kinda cool kinkiness her role but the is stolen elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone he often speaks as he is out of breath showing definite affinity for his way of life he has great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where he is taking photographs of picture and later scene where he is getting freaky tatoo he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing later scene kosteas is little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows denirolike presence hinting that he is capable of bigger roles while hardly enjoyed crash it is still pretty intriguing portrayal of group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world these people are able share rush between two completely different entities and the does not exactly pain them in negative light is sucessful in bringing them light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out despite the hardcore nature of the and the subsequent nc rating there is also an rrated version but would not even go near that thing anyone looking for quick turnon should just rent regular porno,1.0
the first thing you notice about this movie is that it is cold placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside long scenes of snowcovered ground against background of white just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night as most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of works out in the oddest way possible car salesman hires couple of hoods kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs even more remarkably it works the only likable person in the is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity every good the audience gains new knowledge here you learn _two_ things everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy and do not do violent illegal business lowlife amoral degenerate scumsucking losers oh yeah if you get shot in the face using brightly decorated napkin stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy,1.0
plot odin is great high school basketball player he is dating hot girl and the coach loves his ass in fact the coach even admits having fatherly feelings towards him unfortunately the coachs real son hugo is not too pleased hear that in fact he does not like hearing about any of odins triumphs as they generally supersede his own so what does he set out do well let us just say that he starts mess peoples heads and one thing leads another thing leads well you will see critique very powerful thoroughly depressing wellacted nonteen movie starring bunch of teens credit director tim blake nelson for creating modern day version of this shakespearian classic set in realistic high school environment the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core you also have give it up all of the actors in this who turn over some very convincing performances taking you through all of their characters ups and downs hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such despicable character dude who you just want grab the throat and beat the shit out of sign of good actor if you ask me phifer also comes play in this movie nice blend of charisma fear love and anger spread over his character was always on this guys side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along julia stiles was also good but her character was not much different from others that she is played recently was however very surprised martin sheens showing since had not taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years his character is definitely overthetop in this but appreciated his fervor his rage his ultimate and blind desire win above all great example of workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest did have few reservations about the movie though first of all what was all of the gangsta hiphop music used in pretty much every other scene transition it was cute at first but became little too obvious and annoying after few times the was also edited pretty choppily like some scenes were cut out and no one cleaned it up afterwards also did not like the fact that hartnetts character the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this was infallible in other words pretty much everything he says or asks of someone happens automatically and without any goofups mean know the guy is smart and all but would have appreciated little more realism under some of the circumstances but overall the movie will devastate you it is not fun date movie it is not movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks it is about jealousy love envy fury passion revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that is ever passed through your head is it worth seeing oh most definitely pun intended it is moving picture great performances no shakespearian speak thank you god and an outstanding directorial job nelson the final scene alone is enough send massive chill down your spine and was especially impressed the directors choice of music near the end in fact the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver and guess that is saying something right there where is joblo coming from things hate about you election hamlet loves labors lost natural born killers save the last dance shakespeare in love,1.0

well will be damned what most excellent surprise not be confused the campy and far inferior remake starring exporn star traci lords this more recent attempt at remaking the drivein schlockfest not of this earth is real gem and was quite possibly the best scifi flick of once again bmovie king roger corman is behind this effort he directed the original but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns it seems criminal that the was released direct video in most countries because it is an absolute mustsee for scifi fans and treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers kooky bent the plot in brief paul johnson michael york is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who though needing kill people live is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons his race is dying of mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying find cure the key of lies in the blood of humans he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr rochelle whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda elizabeth barondes move in johnson as his private nurse so as give him the blood transfusions he constantly requires but before long amanda and johnsons sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is lot more than just eccentric must admit my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech the dapper clothes and cool spectacles the unexpected pathos he invests in his character york is turns hilarious menacing and tragic this is tourdeforce and quite simply the best performance have seen from him and while obviously made on modest budget the boasts enormous strengths the casting is spot on the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent witty and consistently engaging cleverly updating the original the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect marked contrast the earlier remake from the does not drag for second of its minute running time thanks tight editing and the sure hand of littleknown director terrance winkless and it does not matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy this is schlock after all even if it is high class schlock in fact my only criticism of the is that things get tad weak towards the end tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and few of the characters act rather illogically given their lifethreatening situation but these are minor complaints just see it not of this earth is one of the biggest scifi surprises in years and michael york in one cool swoop you have made yourself bmovie legend dude,1.0

shakespeare you hardly understood it in high school why would you want more of it now that your english grade does not count on it if this is your attitude then will say right off the bat that kenneth branaghs hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now if however you are lover of the bard or at the very least are openminded about challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark namely the king has died and his widow the queen has wed the kings brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brothers hands hamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires capture the conscience of the new king expose his treachery and the game is afoot the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established interior scenes are similarly graced intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers the hamlet castles grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirrorpanel doors and bridges connect opposite sides of secondstory loft costuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination not quite the denmark of the the characters attire is something of cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the more of timeless feel it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively in addition directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character as the revengedriven royal heir branagh provides riveting performance of emotional highs and lows from the anticipation of seeing his fathers ghost the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades every scene truly revolves around hamlet as much tribute branaghs acting and directing as shakespeares manuscript hamlet seems be who is who of shakespeareantrained actors so watching them perform the craft for they have much love is delight in itself julie christie as hamlet us mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players kate winslet as hamlet us lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the characters plummet the depths of dispair and madness richard briers as ophelias father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing nicholas farrell as hamlet us trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the twotiming rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast hamlet also seems be in someone tried stuff as many well known actors as possible in some cases this made for interesting scenes billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well crystal proves himself able deliver the lines both the timing of classic actor and the verbal countenance of comedian and the result is very funny scene however charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all as the player king the leader of troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba part of his monologue is overlaid visual enactment of the story sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention he deserves at this time his offcamera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene narration done any other wellvoiced actor wish branagh had chosen allow us envision in our own minds the scene heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention unfortunately there were some casting choices led poor distractions jack lemmon an excellent actor just cannot do shakespeare as marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlet us ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right those around him gerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo richard attenborough has literally walkon role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador think he had two lines then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway when went see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol you hamlet is complicated tale of treachery and revenge in triumph and defeat become one branagh attempts help us out some of the intricacies visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue presenting them as flashbacktype images this only works about half the time and wonder if it would have been just as well do without them you do not have be some kind of genius appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult understand unless you have the time read or hear it carefully and repeatedly the alternate method of comprehension is that most of us are familiar the high school
