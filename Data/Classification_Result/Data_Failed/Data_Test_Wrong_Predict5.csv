mandingo has traditionally been seen two things either muchneeded revisionist look slavery south or words critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler appeals only sm crowd actually think mandingo strange combination two although fails both fronts too trashy good drama too dramatic good trash story takes place dilapidated louisiana plantation run crotchety old warren maxwell james mason son hammond perry king day new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although never explains mandingo simply name africans come region upper niger river valley according mandingos were rolls royce african slaves hammond pays top price mede has fight off others order get him hammond then spends time training mede fighter money brawls other slaves meanwhile hammond has married cousin blanche susan george because she wants escape her family under pressure father produce grandchild hammond however happier spending nights bed wench derogatory name given female slaves used their masters easy sex quickly apparent hammond despite overt racism more love bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because finds out their wedding night another man had pleasured her before did course fine slept numerous slave girls fact wife white lady had been another man out wedlock destroys capacity care her so blanche usually left lonely sexstarved while hammond sleeping ellen blanche gets back hammond seducing studly mede bearing child hammond father cannot stand idea blanche has given birth halfblack child although okay ellen pregnant hammond so warren kills child letting bleed death after birth hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice shoulder pushes him into giant cauldron boiling water yes read right ends hammond getting revenge boiling mede alive judging only plot mandingo pure sexploitation main purpose seems getting many blacks whites into bed together possible only slightest commentary what would mean th century southern society when mandingo released still bit shocker see miscegenation screen such graphic detail way could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo weak unfocused historically mostly confused if were judge history would easy walk away notion entire system american slavery based sexuality economics once do we see any slaves working except few house servants men spend most time sitting around while sole purpose female slave seems free sex owner there historical basis notion slave owners often slept their female slaves mandingos overwhelming emphasis aspect slavery gives unpleasant taste cheap sex flick although there plenty violence fights vicious beatings shootings aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown good measure some tried write off mandingo blaxploitation number quicklymade lowbudget films appealing black sensibilities early seventies easy mandingo studiofinanced paramount pictures produced dino de laurentiis grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions bible remake king kong illfated dune director richard fleischer veteran best known several special effectsladen action movies including leagues under sea fantastic voyage well such superior suspense films narrow margin script based supermarket bestseller ken ostott subsequent play jack kirkland penned norman wexler had been nominated oscar two years earlier work serpico james mason perry king susan george were wellknown respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under belt ken norton appeared promising career so why mandingo so bad number reasons including fact all those experienced filmmakers behind front camera did lousy job wexlers script pure poor hokum bordering offensive combines stereotyped slavetalk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whutre gittin outta bed stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if see me hang gonna know killed black brother fleischers direction clumsy especially during fight scenes all actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should given where credit due despite its exploitative nature mandingo first hollywood movies take alternative look slavery until then there had been kind underlying racism all hollywood films dealing slavery even classics such gone wind can seen inherently racist its glossing over subject matter mandingo reassessed south showed all beautiful plantations green fields pretty sunsets all constantly undermined films negligible pointofview claims see things black perspective entire narrative focus soap opera tales white owners little more maturity different handling mandingo might been effective worthwhile while portrays many sensitive aspects slavery never deals them issues brings up worthwhile wexlers script refuses move them beyond surface level trashily vicarious viewing there great deal potential honestly exploring nature sexual relationship between slave owner mandingo never does steven spielberg touched same topic schindlers list looking nazi officer writhing inner turmoil because feelings jewish maid difference between mandingo spielberg dealt situation fair unexploitive manner focused inherent human dilemma mandingo satisfied simply show some skin because its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good might accomplished,0.0,1.0

there times when success particular depends entirely actors effort often single performance can turn what might been rather mediocre into something worthwhile when these comes along usually try think about how many other people put work into there no way person could possible carry entire project shoulders sometimes there simply no other explanation such case hurricane biopic about falsely

because there reason works all name denzel washington washington plays carter boxer convicted latenight shooting bar jailed years maintained had never committed crimes remained jail after second trial countless appeals situation changed when group canadians moved washington worked freeing carter through efforts group carters lawyers eventually freed when their case heard federal court judge ruled rubin carter had been unfairly convicted details carters childhood which had him out jail because efforts racist cop dan hedaya when finally got out prison good carter became rising star middleweight pro boxer seemingly having career track until police framed him multiple homicide despite efforts political activists celebrities remained imprisoned flash forward when lesra vicellous reon shannon

reasonably good job pacing shot selection hurricane moves quickly no scene drawn out much further than necessary narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles multiple flashbacks well audience always aware just what time place each scene nothing terribly confusing boxing scenes constructed clear inspiration raging bull get inside action very well they believable real sports footage jewison puts together particularly nice scene utilizing pretty cool trick carter sent solitary confinement days when refuses wear prison uniform jewison assisted some wonderful acting game washington shows how carter gradually starts lose mind during constant solitude eventually we get three rubin carters arguing each other cell jewisons best achievement hurricane succeeding showing how carter becomes embittered man during hardknock life how able break out bitterness learn trust people again sadly though films chief failures lie screenplay most goodbutnotgreat efforts round pike winter there much interest viewer hurricane seems every time gets chance take most clich route possible does take look supporting characters example drawn up either entirely good or entirely evil carter lesra played nicely shannon deserves credit only real people here everyone else stereotype canadians good cops bad canadians spend most their time dolefully grinning each other their loveydovey commune commune despite films failure make clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts out shadows glowers every black person enters room much dialogue comes off rather hokey hate put me prison loves gonna bust me out big courtroom climax during which everyone gets make impassioned speech could been lifted madefortv lifetime special too bad cast game director does job subject matter interesting script takes safer slightly more boring route far too often wanted real reason cop hold grudge against carter other than racist pig wanted more evidence these canadians real people faults virtues instead bunch saintly crusaders looking justice short wanted see through less distorted lens criticism has been levied against liberties hurricane takes truth what really happened carter much deserved example gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only screwed judges ruled giardello winner most accounts fight however carter losing fairly furthermore much carters criminal past conveniently left out just why convicted again second trial never really explained course hurricane works mainly fable so digressions truth can excused least partially even dismissing such issues do remove fact hurricane highly flawed only actor could made schmaltzy predictable picture like work well does good thing hurricane has actor carter has been quoted saying denzel washington making me look good only washington makes look good denzel washingtons hurricane sounds pretty good me,1.0,0.0
