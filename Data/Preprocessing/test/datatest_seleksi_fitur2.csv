Review,Class
warning spoilers are included in this review but it does not really make much of difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of remember when dantes peak came out in february few months later volcano was released the first was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films had ever seen the latter was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well it is deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head head in competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming cometdisaster be released the beginning of july of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed mine and so am in the minority as was when stood on the side of dantes peak but while watching deep impact began wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this apparently many did and it utterly baffles me be completely honest have not had this little fun watching disaster in my entire life volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun watch deep impact does not just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives it half star above my bottom ranking is slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on local movie theater pushing it back line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers comet and his teacher sends photo of the unknown object an astronomer who then is able determine the correct path of this distant comet in about few seconds he races off mail the information but is killed in reckless car accident year passes and nothing is heard about it again we are then introduced jenny lerner a leoni reporter for msnbc she gets handed job investigate possible coverup in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair girl named ellie after talking rittenhouse and unsatisfied the information she gets she decides use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled before she can use the information the government decides push her car off the road they take her in meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for hours so they can confirm it and then hold press conference naturally she wants be compensated and they offer her front row seat and the chance for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet the public and their plans send massive spacecraft out destroy it before it can arrive they announce plan called ark is their only hope for survival computer will select people at random these people are the ones who will go into large cave underground so that the impact of the comet will not kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longerapproximately ninety years from what understand and the humans could come back the surface and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disaster procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional it is shame that nothing else is heartfelt now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt stop the comet because we all know that it will not work director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction episodes of the hit television show er her major debut was the peacemaker pathetic and heartless action well this time leder outdid herself creating worse than that one suggestion ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off throughout the we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months weeks hours it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in realtimeit is that boring of course leder is not all blame for it screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story that only gets worse time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going have more sex than anyone else in school and stupid characters you might think we were back in the again only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot is so outrageous that you cannot figure out if this is supposed be an action drama or scifi put it simply the special effects of this are hit and miss situation that is right miss and hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic but the comet is huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening the concept of even trying land on comet is preposterous enough but that is forgiveable what is not forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface give me break will ya and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used and it looks so bad that heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks in fact may even recommend the for those who want see how bad effects can actually get these days just when we think visual effects cannot be improved along comes show that they really can and should be one thing has struck wrong note me concerning mimi leders direction also influences the actors leder loves show the actors faces before and during moments of terror this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of sadist one moment has an astronaut flying off into space this should be enough warrant response from the audience but leder wants go farther and shows us the persons face while drifting into space this is one of the cheapest ways ellicit an emotional response from an audience and for one am not going be fooled on another note leders only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones it is obvious it will be emotional it is mostly just big trick rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it did not work for me but anyway the actors do as much as they can what they are given a leoni bad boys tvs the naked truth is the best of the and she is given the meatiest role her character is made stronger leonis presence and we grow care for her robert duvall is energetic and fun watch but his character is turned into shreds the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still has not had many good roles wood stick drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced her strong presence on screen maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances date is quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but think she just suffered from poorly written character special note should go ron eldard and denise crosby eldard is good in his role but is limited the plot crosby is special me personally because she was tasha yar from tvs star trek the next generation seeing her was one of the highlights of the overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg for disaster related elements and brief language this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things come this summer could be one of the worst ever luckily the xfiles movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful it is shame that this will do so successfully because it just is not worth much costing nearly million special effects done the illustrious ilm is huge shocker and score composed oscarwinner james horner titanic one might have expected this be more fun witness and experience well it is not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this along it,0.0

ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie has attempted produce more and more films about hacking these films usually show the audience look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous if it is not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect hackers is guilty of all of these crimes anyone familiar computers andor the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you cannot take it anymore those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs this is the section for mistakes in the movies well imdb sums up hackers extremely well the first goof listed generally illinformed and ridiculous the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology and truthfully this is onehundred percent correct the plot obviously centers around computer hacking more specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy young computer hacker played jonny lee miller miller should be extremely thankful for the trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers the opens young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems he was forbidden use computer until he turned eighteen years old the then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer dade later meets up fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying do what is next impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught the fbi oh and as little subplot dade also tries woo acid burn the only female hacker in the really cannot think of much more say about the films plot aside from what have said it is just bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi thanks this movie the public unfamiliar computers now has distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do this movie makes computers look little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many list sum it up hackers is terrible computer if you are looking for about computers closer what goes on in the real world suggest sneakers although at times it too may seem little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers regular computer users hopefully this did not influence too many young computer users out think they can do what is portrayed in this minute waste of time,0.0
if there is one thing just cannot stand it is that oozes sentimentality heres note all makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves swelling saddening music is not good way tell us that the people in the are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless alas my giant is that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and such high intensity that forgot as watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up what reminded me was that was not choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter my giant is forced contrived and conspicuously uncute detest the word cute but have chosen use it because the makers clearly wanted create cute here it takes premise that might have been interesting liked the preview and bogs it down endless plot turns and cliches all of are intended get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience maybe it will work for some people it did not work for me billy crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the is in romania he is in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in car accident and get saved an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall his name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks he would be great movie star because of his size subplots are as follows sam has son and wife kathleen quinlan and he is never around for them so they move chicago max is in love woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the begins sam convinces max go back america him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved sam is broke max is dying pass the kleenex my giant as comedy is only moderately funny it has its moments the best of features steven seagal making fun of himself in one great scene sam gets his son on the phone talk seagal of course his son does not believe that he is actually speaking seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is would quote the line like but it would probably lose its effect crystal is always entertaining and he has few good lines here some of are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however he is countered slew of jokes that are not funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes muresan is kind of fun watch but he just cannot act very well quinlan on the other hand is great actress who needs get role that shows off her talents she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in she could show us her stuff here the best thing she gets do is fake romanian accent all of these disappointing ingredients create that for much of its running time is simply mediocre as my giant lumbers its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically pull at our heartstrings sams multiple engagements his family are all completely hackneyed how about main character who has healthy relationship his family later it turns out the entire story is supposed be great big metaphor signifying sams reunion his family and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is valiant thing but had few morality problems it and apologize for being vague it is icky it drips gooey wannabe human emotions my giant could have been straightforward and funny family more importantly it could have been moving on level far deeper than it is instead it is complicated overlong and underengaging that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears and since it left me feeling completely unmoved stand my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world,0.0
this is not simple plan about finding plane load of money and getting away the cash this is more about parable of greed and how money can become the bane of your life yes there are elements of fargo here the snow and cold although not as vivid in the blood and gore department it shows how greed can set of chain of events leading death and the destruction of lives and how at the end of the day the things that matter most are love truth and honesty although in one sense it may seem tedious making movie about the ugliness of greed not box office material it does become tedious not because of the morale ending but because one expects the movie end that way this becomes apparent after the first murder cover up the crime the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there the characters in this drama are mixture of simple and intellectual folk brothers and friends who all fall prey the avarice of money they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible level headed and not affected greed give the party more balance commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful bill paxton also gives powerful performance as the greedier younger brother whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife who indirectly causes the most problems fill room full of greedy people and several million dollars and you will end up simple recipe for blood bath it is not simple plan when you shoot everyone you love for money unless you are the menendez brothers,0.0

in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa the twilight murders another one from the series is dealing the case of gordon kahl played rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend year in prison than pay taxes the despised s government after being released he still refuses pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest when the s marshals come arrest him it turns out that kahl is not alone many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that that brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt however his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement after betrayed thriller costa gavras mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight until that time only the television movies like this one bothered pay attention that phenomenon unfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television that uses sensationalist real life content in order cover lack of originality in the script sometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama should not be on the other hand is steadily directed dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl on the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction some of the actors is terrible however does deal potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen should not be the total waste of time,0.0
the following review contains spoilers it is just the way we are rapist matt frewer responds supergirls helen slater query as why she is being attacked an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl will admit it love superman iii know it is hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think it is worthy addition the man of steel franchise supergirl spinoff of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind does not even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time as the begins we see the residents of argo city commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton resides in inner space go about their daily lives ok what so these are exiles from krypton blew up right were they living there before krypton exploded how do you get inner space this whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world how do they know where superman went how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me argo city is kept running power source called the omegahedron one day the founder of argo city zaltar peter toole gives the omegahedron supermans cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art kara uses it create buglike thing immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city in the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians death in three days time or something kara then climbs into pod zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron save her world the power source travels directly earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging minorleague witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires rule the world her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her her evil plans and she sets out achieve world domination selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that she is arrived as supergirl complete appropriate costume supergirl emerges from the bottom of lake when she arrives ok huh why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of lake attention movie explain yourself am sorry can only suspend disbelief so much cannot buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me knowing that she needs secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into school girl outfit complete different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school she is given her dorm assignment and who happens be her roommate lois lanes sister lucy ok coincidence is one thing folks but we are getting really contrived now what follows are some generic allgirls school hijinks complete evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even shower scene best moment though comes when supergirl decides put bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it socks at this point am rapidly wondering why am bothering this nonsense there is some credit give the however one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying small town in search of its prey is very well done also its commendable see genders reversed in the whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools hart bochner die hard is particularly fun as karas love interest lovesick landscaper who is under spell cast selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the films more ridiculous moments when he has be rescued from being tapped some menacing bumper cars then there were numerous little things that bothered me the flying effects are never convincing for moment it is all too obvious that helen slater is hooked wires instead of having her look like she is flying the filmmakers wanted her be graceful so she poses lot and does ballettype maneuvers also who are the first two humans meet supergirl when she arrives on earth pair of truck driversrapists who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise there is also some rampant product placement in the most notably for popeyes tylenol and aw root beer the latter actually putting its logo on the tshirt of one of the rapists finally just one word monsters faye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully however when otoole overacts he is entertaining and when dunaway does it she is annoying her character actually says the line seize them at one point dunaways henchmen played peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beattys otis character from the first two superman movies helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character she is written be as she is able gaze at flowers and bunnies the right amount of genuine wonder make it believable believability aside though it is still annoying now despite all this negativity and am not alone here supergirl is not well liked nor well respected movie in many circles leave it the good people at anchor bay entertainment actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd they have released two separate editions of the on dvd the delight of many people including myself yet am still unclear as why since this movie is so awful the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the runs minutes longer than the print ran in s theaters the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of is enhanced for televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory extras on the disc include full length audio commentary track director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent minute documentary from called supergirlthe making of feature dig that workout montage trailers tv spots talent bios indepth storyboards accompanied score from the movie and assorted still galleries the transfer on this international version is incredible you would think you were watching new release images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts only some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just is not much that can be done about that unless you are obsessive like george lucas the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however you will be hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score is completely unrelated john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for cannon films golanglobus production the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries bosco seems be an expert in all things supergirl and is there szwarc ensure that there is no dead air on the track bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn great deal more about the as result of his participation although at times you can tell that bosco is looking for specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he does not get that response we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the christopher reeve great detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out as it stands superman is written off early on in the when we hear radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission for the sake of brevity will not even get into that one szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been hit at the box office again for the sake of brevity will not even get into that one anchor bay has also released limited edition only copies pressed twodisc set disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release disc two features the never before seen directors cut of the runs minutes long the additions mainly consist of scene extensions do not add much of note except for few moments lengthen peter otooles screen time particularly during his latter appearances the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the will not care one question though should not the directors commentary be on the directors cut of the would never seen supergirl before sat down watch this dvd was nine when it was released theaters and even then was smart enough inform my parents not take me see it so when popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair had no idea what expect knew the was not beloved and never had any interest in it before but was willing give it shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc as the disc began spin was rather impressed the opening sequence made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong come find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo so slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started at the end of the supergirl flies back into the lake the omegahedron and flies back argo city ugh give up am surprised even made it the end of the not once not twice but three times review these discs supergirl is definitely terrific dvd package but very lousy movie

practical magic is that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and highprofile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing claptrap like this one the stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from long line of witches spanning back years at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go live their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest switch the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit truck and killed come think of it she is not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes when gillian calls sally come get her after having another abusive spat visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house add this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not mention spattering of lighthearted whimsy and you have pretty good idea how messy practical magic is after seeing the reflected that there was not even one scene or element that liked or enjoyed it is comedy be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching it is not charming or entertaining in any way and then top it off we have got this dark but birdbrained story of an evil spirit taking over gillians body whatever the characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting be what you could call character there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided be in this and in every scene involving them they are always standing sidebyside no attempt is made flesh them out into actual people the same goes for aidan quinn as handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the minute mark and once again there is no attempt develop their relationship or his character in any way in fact every line of dialogue in the is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting know the people saying the lines should have know was headed for trouble during the opening credits when found out the screenplay was written the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed destroy the batman series batman forever and batman and robin practical magic is directed griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted love meg ryan and matthew broderick disliked that movie quite bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you taste of what talentless filmmaker he is would tell him quit while he is ahead but in these last two years he is ultimately already buried himself,0.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned was incredulous when first heard that mgm was planning sequel their sciencefiction flick species squandering an intriguing premise the original turned out be dreadful mess widely disliked both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming financial success raking in over million domestic during the competitive summer season despite distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsleys splendid actor but marquee name he as not miraculously dodging the bullet the first doubted that they would dare tempt fate and go for another round so here comes species ii new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails capitalize on potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly unmitigatedly stupid the follows the exploits of young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying bed as many different ladies as he possibly can in other words patrick is like lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of huge percentage of men his age but there is catch he is an astronaut who recently returned from seemingly successful mission mars and who is now infected alien dna patricks overriding compulsion mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring and when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge halfhuman halfalien clone of the monster from the first being studied in government lab patricks primary focus turns her if these two were mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role admirable conviction species ii opens the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking even splicing back dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around however this all looks positively inspired when compared the first appearance of the evil alien goo ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as whether or not this is cheesy bmovie is quickly answered mr brancatos original screenplay is filled outrageous lines often leaves the audience in stitches like the first and perhaps in homage it there is real penchant for dialogue underlines the obvious last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering bloodsoaked room something bad happened here this time laura gets stand over fresh shredded corpse its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful and she is not even empathic and when psychotically horny patrick accosts supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in woefullypaced suspense sequence eve who is telepathically linked her alienhumanhybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists he is going rape her while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates sense of humour of its own there is an amusing tongueincheek bit of product placement does not really make much sense but appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx he is in aisle informs eve if the maintained this sort of lighthearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable watch but its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along bloody effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion much of the fails make whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that it is terribly difficult contain any suspension of disbelief the implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eves brain why are the guards armed guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual my favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting contain her what look like body blocks this is the sort of movie leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that it is being foisted upon the public returning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can this goofy screenplay but there is realistically only so much one can do this script as basis mykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on generic brashmouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patricks neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the mr lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all ms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that she is so empowered lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now that is what call empowerment,0.0
the sequel the fugitive s marshals is an average thriller using it is association the fugitive just so it can make few extra bucks tommy lee jones returns his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive this time he is after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course he is been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes run for it gerard not so hot on his tail what follows is about hours of action brought us the director of executive decision another curiously involving plane when comparing this movie the fugitive the prequel is far superior but even on it is own s marshals is pretty lousy movie while the original was reasonably intelligent and had fugitive root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time while the fugitive gave little time develop harrison fords character s marshals is straight in there pulling it is trump card the place crash almost immediately be honest could not care less if snipes character got captured or not snipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons will explain later tommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly challenge the sense of deja vu was overwhelming know it is the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt develop his character from the last there is few nudge nudge references from the first but apart from that nothing nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who is roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife nobody looks as if their having good time and all the performers are on autopilot the supporting cast are k but when it comes performances s marshals falls flat on it is face it does not fare any better plotwise either the starts off gerard trying capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory as said above the is an normal average terrorist thriller seen million times before but is using the fugitive reputation make it sound more professional if this was not the sequel the fugitive this would probably go straight video or not even been made at all because it is so average and because of the films plot changing it is course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie stuart baird the director is all right but there is no particular scene that stands out it is director is the usual action movie style even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension the special effects are nice especially the plane crash and there is good if very loud soundtrack veteran composer jerry goldsmith but in the end s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement sure it is loud and dumb but in the end s marshals just as not fun bored performers and lackluster plot and script do not make good action movie overall rating review david wilcock web space provided geocities,0.0
one of the contributors the destruction of the batman franchise chris odonnell stars in this remake of buster keatons silent seven chances now have never seen seven chances as am more of chaplin fan than keaton fan but seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this odonnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of pool table manufacturing company he also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years he is unwilling marry her his reasons well he is guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently do not like be roped or something hey that is the movies explanation would marry renee zellweger in second eventually it comes time for jimmie propose and when he does it is the most absurd proposal ever uttered man ever he essentially says her you win and hands her ring the audience should now hate this character did then the meat of the plot presents itself jimmies grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business however in order get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday is just over hours away having blown his chances anne jimmie proceeds track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest business proposition the movie was not half bad this time surprisingly it was not boring me and even managed read my thoughts at one point ustinovs character left video will and while he is reading the ridiculous clause in it thought myself what is this brewsters millions as soon as thought it hal holbrooks character actually says what is this brewsters millions it was quite surreal something happens though during the films final act that caused me sharply drop the rating it was going receive up that point all of jimmies prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition felt was good at least the was not painting women be cold hearted gold diggers when jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played artie lange making career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes front page story at this point women don wedding gowns and head off persuade jimmie pick them be his bride these women arrive at jimmies location and immediately start bullying him about what he is looking for in woman when he is had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that there is been mistake and he will not be marrying any of them as result the women proceed chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off this goes on for the rest of the it is just chris odonnell running from obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women my groans of disgust could be heard for miles the finally ended thankfully but this day am still groaning the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video it contains the in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of cast and crew info and special dvdrom features the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc contains scenes not in the apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing odonnell around the city and at one point odonnell is leaping from the tops of buses so that was bad enough be cut but the other minutes of bride shenanigans was good ugh,0.0

starting the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch what the general viewing publicparticularly kids wanted see therefore it is some surprise that as big fan of the above mentioned movies was so disappointed pocahontas despite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes as are its characters group of englishmen lead the evil governor ratcliffe come the new world in search of gold no regard for the savages that live there the natives look upon the english just as much fear and distrust only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent terrible clash the ending as it turns out is not entirely happy one and is one of the films finer moments the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth governor ratcliffe for instance is snobbish singleminded bore whose mere appearance is supposed bring about hisses captain john smith is blond hunk who while slightly misguided is good at heart pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced marry man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time she even comes complete insignificant best friend again against tradition talking animals are not used but lusty wizened talking tree is this is an odd compromise but it is one of the few elements that really work the animals are delight and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun rather bland presentation maybe it would have been better if we saw the story unfold through their eyes the talking tree who seems have thing for john smith is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch the music welcome delight in the later disney films is mostly let down here the exception of the catchy and motivational colors of the wind mel gibson as the voice of john smith has solid singing voice and should have been used more the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character was rather bored through what turned out be shorter than expected running time even the children in the audience seemed restless while there is no stopping kid from seeing something that they wantor disney wants them tomost believe will be disappointed perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes history it is all right change or embellish fantasy suit movies entertainment value but doing so historical facts does not work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewers minds and plot holes that are never filled even the artwork another disney strong point varies greatly in quality making any story problems even more obvious as mentioned above there were many questions that stayed me while viewing the for instance if john smith was truly such world traveler and had so much experience savages why did he so quickly change his previous kill as many indians as can attitude if he was such nice guy after all he should have changed his ways long before this or how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience but simply saying that they had met missionary years earlier would have cleared up lot history was modified in the anyway as it is wonder if it does not give kids the wrong impression in short the is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set while disney tried valiantly in many ways break some of their firmest traditions they end up failing on too many levels,0.0

when respecting director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect woody allen has made couple lessthan good films and he is my favorite even martin scorsese has not had perfect track record kevin smith after smashing debut the classic clerks stooped as low sellout and make the dreadful mallrats mean so far the only director who is made several films none of have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all were great now adore quentin tarantino his first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time but just was not that good of year for him he made way too many tv appearances he mispronounced jackie chans name on the mtv movie awards and he made this he was also awarded an oscar so guess that would be grand exception robert rodriguez is also great director not brilliant one but cool one have never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders so cannot comment on them but in this crap ensemble directors all four give pitiful efforts pitiful for any director too now in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out have never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woodys one was hilarious but not totally up par but will rate each individually and then report back you on the overal average score of the exposition simple one bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who is god and all but not in this one though he has couple good moments is working on new years eve for

good thing about this is it has good cast in turn it wastes pitifully not even actually funny for second my rating out of no stars the wrong man writerdirector alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little another stupid sex thing going on ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games ted tries escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon but at least this has bit of comedy in it just not that much and david proval has never overacted as much and it is pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets puke from window masterpiece compared the first one but still the misbehavers writerdirector robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek would robert rodriguez be the same without salma hayeks navel nope luckily she is on the tv dancing so we get see her surprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing it this one seemed have the most potential it was fastpaced funny and well funny but when watched it it seemed anticlimactic and only seemed gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny but as said it moves slowly and in that way it is more painful than funny but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time oh the plot antonio is supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out get drunk at new years party antonio hires ted for couple bucks watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it was okay the man from writerdirector quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again ironically this one could be considered the best for bad reason it best represents what quentin has done this he plays chester spoiled brat actor or something who has just had huge boxoffice hit on his hands and is living it up playing an anticlimactic game from hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in row they are drunk and need sober but nervous ted hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter does not light they also pay him lot of cash this is so much exactly what this little is about that it is campy tim roth was probably payed lot of money do this stupid part in this stupid made bunch of people who are high on themselves ecause they have had hits major or minor it took quentin realize that but the thing is it does not seem like he realizes that if he did would give this good stars but this sucked it was anticlimactic and the dialogue was not very good he starts off very long steadicam shot then goes flashes that makes no sense it is cool for while then he makes it uneven it is long and it is just not very good hopefully quentin never repeats what he did this one conclusion what is the moral here if you have made celebrated films do not do an ensemble piece they should have rewatched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks none of these have any point them and they are embarrassing not only the writerdirectors but the actors ecause they are working crap but will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward quentins next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back the top immeadiately the cool from dusk till dawn found exhilerating love quentin and suppose it is good he made the man from because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema seem respect directors if they are not gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes the man from is his big mistake and let us hope he does not return her continuously,0.0
you do not need have seen the original species appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is few exceptions sequels tend be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is followup is not the only reason it is so miserable it is the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction the plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in soil sample back aboard their shuttle the slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black that should have been the end of the movie right there back on terra firma at least one of the crew is now carrier of alien dna and as you will remember if you saw the first movie driven strong urge procreate on parallel track government scientists have cloned version of sil from the first now called eve again played natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing this apparently includes observing eves reaction the dukes of hazzard tv show she appears enjoy eves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates we are forced witness in grossout detail but otherwise there does not appear be whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this unless it was written into her contract let us hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only eve finally breaks free of her confinesand her brafor the finale but the effects are so messy you cannot really see what is going on peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams told em not go at the top of his lungs referring the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash badge and claim be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve the tv reruns they are both unbelievably wooden what is talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe wonder it is an unfortunate trend this oncetalented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names unchallenging horror flicks like species ii last year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there and the first species was helmed roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment his previous choice of projects is it just that there are no better offers out there species ii is worthless worse than that it is also exploitative offensive and insulting the intelligence at every turn it is not that there is not anything positive say about the there is after minutes it ends,0.0

this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation but lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and know what you did last summer but switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy make any of the proceedings interesting switchback opens the murder of babysitter and the abduction of the young child she is watching we learn late in the game that the kid belongs fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the kidnapperkiller is nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite while he is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest does not keep him from offering pursuit lacrosses most recent trek takes him bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff lee ermey is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man in related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered even on the seatbelts el dorado along the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto this tangent is not random one as bob or lane will end up either holding piece of the puzzle or turn out be the killer himself or is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about in sense that is half of the basic problem switchback for its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so we are given little insight into who they are likely for fear that we will learn too much too fast and therefore be able make the proper deduction but switchback then decides explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense some of the acting is burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves what is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot and dennis quaid that monotone stop it ermey is solid in supporting role that is more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my socalled life is scenestealer tried and true from material standpoint switchback is pretty empty but even when firsttime director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard does not know what do he knows what he wants it look like the movie provides some great visuals the setonatrain climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor still that is not enough turn lump of coal into diamond and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold,0.0

i never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently have just never experienced anything in my life was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth after all have never been war have never been the victim of any violent crime have never really been broken hearted and have never been audited so really had no frame of reference as people meant when they said that something was hell on earth then saw cruel intentions in perfect world would be in charge of all the movie studios the very first thing would do in this perfect world would be take every producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america something cast playing teenagers and featuring soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail but it would not just be your average jail not even maximum security installation would have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of war crimes tribunal and forced beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity now you are probably thinking yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is the answer is no it is actually much worse watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably lot like stabbing yourself in the arm chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound and then pouring acid on the salt do not know if kumble was trying evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion felt was sheer boredom from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz the conclusion do not remember because had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there war and tax audits,0.0
about an hour or so into the jackal character wandered around as people were being shot at in big suspense sequence and one of the audience members in the theatre saw it in shouted out hope she gets killed now at that point it hit me did not care for any of the characters being played actors did not really like when the sole reason you care about character being played sidney poitier in suspense is because he is being played sidney poitier you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark every year couple films like this are released you know the cheap action packed international espionnage featuring semipromising premise some bigname actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago this was the third one of following the very lackluster the saint featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying stop an almost untraceable villain the jackal tries mix both elements and you thought the saint was bad the jackal is loosely very loosely hope based on the fred zimmerman classic that have yet see the day of the jackal featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played edward fox trying assasinate charles degaule well welcome the where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying kill the head of the fbi or is he after being hired russian mob lord as bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he will be able assasinate this person and still get away live in seclusion and like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again elude people the agent working on the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives up early on and meets an exira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of who is in massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever soon he is out working the two untrusting agents and trying help them catch him there are numerous problems the and one is the biggest one is pretty impossible put finger on the is supposed be big suspense thriller but save couple moments the never achieves suspense or even sense of intrigue sure the big assasination attempt is bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the is too short and too dull register the never picks up enough become thrilling experience or even an entertaining one it does not help that the plot is designed be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances the script of the jackal is complete mess mostly because it cannot decide what it wants focus on is this about man trying find redemption catching nasty killer is it about nasty amoral hitman who is in everything for the money or is it combination of both the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character the connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast the worst part is the little past they try give declan most notably his relationship an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then the supporting characters are worse sidney poitier is given completely unplayable role that of man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable what is poitier doing here he is one of the best living actors does he really need waste his time doing drivel like this diane venoras russian character is almost as bad cigarette perpetually in her mouth and plastered on expressionless facade it is not that anyones bad here it is that they have nothing do the plot is joke feeling like it was pasted together someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain there are several times where he is in tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted toss in cheap thrill take scene where he is being followed some agents into parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it does not killing someone attract more attention than it does distract and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in public place geez is there anything good here well couple things did like williss icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth chuckle richard gere has couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have and couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where he tests out new gun on an annoying gun builder jack black and bit where he seduces gay washington man has its share of couple good jokes most particular kiss willis but none of these elevate the any higher than it could go they are just little distractions along the way amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal director michael catonjones who directed the far superior rob roy has made that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way every now and then the filmmakers get it right clear and present danger was enormous fun in that smart kinda way but the jackal is an example of when they go completely wrong,0.0

what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps excellent comeback performances in their most recent films john frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin screenwriter ehren kruger gave remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and cigarettes even charlize theron who was convinced could not act did decent job in cider house rules when all of these bright stars come together one would assume that the movie will have great potential be entertaining after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games disbelief was my first reaction then frustration the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an allrookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull may have rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are it seemed like everyone was restricted just the script and not given fair amount of improvisational rights we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set it is so apparent in number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes his friends at bar the actors in that movie were having fun and from that the audience had fun reindeer games is the complete opposite the actors do not seem want be their characters even danny trejo who will do practically anything does not look like he is enjoying himself causing the audience quickly lose interest evidence of public disapproval was noted when woman behind me yelled boy this movie is horrible and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments the story follows man rudy ben affleck who is leaving prison in few days along his best friend and cellmate nick james frain nick has been exchanging love letters beautiful woman ashley charlize theron and cannot wait leave prison and meet her in person when nick is killed in prison riot rudy decides pretend be nick and take ashley out on date for the christmas holidays unfortunately ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise interferes their relationship thinking rudy is nick he kidnaps rudy and threatens kill him unless he helps rob casino nick use work at as security guard now rudy must pretend be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel confused the movie only gets more complex as it goes on until it gets way way too complex at its climax but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour the hero commits greedy selfish act when he decides pretend he is his dead cellmate in order date ashley some hero the point of hero is do the morally correct thing person for the audience relate or admire when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble instead of gathering support from me for him ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted see him fail at times the most irritating part of the besides the fact that this is christmas movie released in february is the number of chances the bad guys get kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason the routine in the bad guy must explain his genius plan the hero before attempting kill him some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays especially when eagerly want see the hero dead the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as prisoner upset his food why he was in this movie for such pointless role beats me why any of these people had anything at all do this movie beats me,0.0

seen may at m at the crossgates cinema theater chris wessell and sean oshea for theater rating very good sound picture and seats the bigbudget megahype event movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming weekly routine instead of seasonal one gluttony is hollywoods favorite sin but it is the moviegoers who pay the price being dealt the same things over and over on an everworsening basis lost in space is the latest such offering so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre it is made up of every element of science fiction but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for audiences attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend such films this one opens fastpaced space battle serves not only as the most interesting scene in the probably because it has star wars written all over it but as the producers way of showing off their budget through the special effects battle scenes are worthless without tension and since we have no idea what the setting is it is impossible care about anything that happens in essence the entire segment works like teaser for an arcade game not piece of filmmaking we meet the robinson family family of five that does not get along but has been chosen act on earths behalf in effort find another planet worthy of colonization due the exhausting of our natural resources each member of the family has special trait and personality and yet none of them seem like actual people professor john robinson hurt is the intelligent quiet leader who has devoted so much time his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it it is obvious what role this aspect will play of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and each other while the necessary problems are resolved at the right moments the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it is presented in completely serious manner without trace of satire and is so pathetic it is laughable the first act is not building of story but juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than plug in all the required elements such as plot conflict and characterization god forbid we are provided the minimum amount possible of these elements keep the from being completely silent in fact it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually nonexistent yes the characters do speak but they do not talk they say things that only relate the conflict but they never really interact unless it is the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west leblanc and uptight unemotional judy robinson graham it is amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens eventually the pacing rapidly increases but the amount of genuine interest does not the story finally gains some prospective living up its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing defeat dr smith oldman the cartoony villain and his plans for sabotage what ensues is series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as alien lite the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly escape it and survive but there is never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly plotlines are developed but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario scenario the atmosphere attempts be surreal incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes but it is presented in such ridiculous way it is utterly boring the time the last act rolls around there is no sense of payoff building the ending does not go out on high note any kind of climax instead it seems come sudden halt but at least it ends at all lost in space is major production at its worst it is frightening that so poorly written directed and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment,0.0
the only thing worse than watching bad movie is realizing that the had lot of potential and could have been effective such is the case _urban legend_ the new horror from first time director jamie blanks the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the muders people according various urban legends examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house the killer wears one of those l bean parkas the hood drawn completely up so you cannot see the face guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days anyhow the premise is certainly nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric it is very good setup that promises more chills come unfortunately the never takes off from there the movie takes place on peaceful new england college campus like most slasher flicks this one also centers around young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac have always wondered why these killers do not save themselves lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim kill after the fine first scene the movie degenerates into monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares these are always accompanied loud bursts of music guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast the slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew false scares should always be used in moderation someone needs tell director blanks that things like this just are not as scary as they used be this movie commits the biggest sin horror can commitit is not frightening remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream _ this movie still adheres them tons of illogical moments about more than really have the inclination list and do not mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense that type of illogical can be fun this insults your intelligence more times than care remember the last minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you will be laughing more than you will be screaming actually you will not be screaming at all at its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script could have definitely used rewrite or two the still manages have some strong points the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough satistfy most gore fans there are some intentionally funny moments these were exceeded the unintentional ones the is well made from technical standpoint besides the first part there is also another good scene prolonged cat and mouse chase inside radio station if there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music _urban legend_ might have been worth your money,0.0
my opinion on can be easily swayed the presence of actors love love ralph fiennes love uma thurman love sean connery hell am even big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and have been eagerly awaiting the ever since few months into the summer however noticed that its release date had been changed few times and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground then in this final week before its official release learned that it was not be screened for critics and that the actors had not been plugging the on late night programs and that it was directed the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique my expectations fell pieces when learned all of these things the saw today did not even meet those expectations this is lousy incoherent mess would slam it harder if it were not for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired that is the main problem the avengers for all it is hiphop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired it is like chore bland exercise in superhero making it also feels like its been cut pieces clocking in at minutes and forgetting close some of its own subplots this is just plain depressing the avengers is version of the popular television show frequent readers of mine will not be surprised learn that have never watched an episode was not alive then do not even watch television now am very sorry that do not have this perspective but judging from the reviews have already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse did not know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore was not as upset see how these actors love have managed thrash their roles also doubt that familiarity the series would allow me understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this based on what the told me gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just really smart doctor who also happens know lot about weather and about beating people up while limited tight leather suits they are work together under mothers orders mother is played jolly jim broadbent while his coconspirator father is played the equallytalented fiona shaw it seems that there is man out there controlling the weather his name is de wynter connery he is crazy scottish guy our heroes had better stop him or else the weather will keep getting colder until they have go hell warm up one of the films few funny lines along the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense for example our heroes are eventually attacked swarm of giant mechanical insects machineguns attached their torsos now killer bugs do not really go the weathercontrolling theme of the the purpose of the bugs other than annihilate our heroes is never established they are never even directly connected de wynter they are controlled his crazy henchman played eddie izzard the special effects are not bad but they are loud obnoxious and intrusive like so many scenes in the it seems present only keep your attention from waning and guarantee you it will wane stopped thinking about the story when realized it did not do any good think the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved could not tell us what happens there are several scenes in the preview that did not make the final cut in addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy quality makes it feel lowbudget the last scene is particularly bad the scenes that do not feature action should be electric thanks our wonderful cast they are not the action scenes should be electric because this is an action they are not either and what about this wasted cast oh it makes me weep disappointment we are talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever love the guy have loved all his films until this one he seems like he wants understand the but he is as lost as we are and thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent cannot manage look at home here do not blame her completely for there is strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it cannot be easy deal such terrible screenwriting connery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter who is blame is it the screenwriter don macpherson perhaps although can see shell of story here that could have been good superhero movie had it been handled right is it the actors for gods sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on this was travelling blame director jeremiah chechik who should not have been given the task begin his best benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed be but here it mostly seems like lot of failed attempts at wit and humor add that lack of experience in bigbudget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory if the avengers has saving grace it is the set design the sets stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing look at like the final setpiece on de wynters island even if none of it makes bit of sense admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere also enjoyed michael kamens music score particularly in the opening credits but this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but there is lot more that needs be here inspiration for instance would have been really nice maybe little bit of cohesion in the story or sense of purpose most of all though would have liked see these actors relish in their roles damn this movie for not giving them the chance,0.0

the last line or near that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying think we need bigger bat cave or something that note that is exactly what this is too big for its own good because it has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one of the villains it is too much handle in one dosage it is so much that characters get left behind poor elle gets mere scenes and subplot is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form and elle deserves better this is the fourth in the gigantic series and the second from director joel schumacher it is also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed the almostasstunning sequel and then the anticlimactic third one first joel this ones not anticlimactic knew it was gonna suck it is up joel make it fun though batman forever was fun this is big bore of overproduced action sequences and shallow characters mean this one bit am gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ahnold who is wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days he is huge exscientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has body temperature of big fat zero and has blue body batman george and robin chris fight him bit but find they are growing apart meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out he is used her research develop an uberman bane who is basically man pumped chemicals probably killed any personality he ever had she emerges from her chemicals do not ask ecause cannot tell ya as sexy woman the real uma who is poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people she starts tear away at the dynamic duo meanwhile alfreds dying of the same disease mr freezes wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batmans alterego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants commitment after year but he says nothing end of her for all we know mr freeze ultimately teams poison ivy and they want freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population do not ask the trio must team together as family beat them there ya go not the whole story but no big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together of nice little ideas would have made for couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villainbatman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems do almost nothing batman in this one he gets some corny speeches couple clever lines and that is it maybe some stunts for all this cannot even comment on george clooney as batman hardly saw the guy and when did he had horrible dialogue say think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode george is in between them he is not quintessential he is not horrible he is good but am sure next time when they decide renovate the series since they will be critically murdered for this sorry effort we will get good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job the villains are the only interesting part of the series according schumacher last time we had the brawn of two face as played tommy lee jones and the brainscomedy supplied the riddler as realized jim carrey this time we have somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze we feel bad for his mentalphysical collapse but does he really need kill everyone for plants arnold is not very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness it is like she is almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points she is incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much star better as for the lower batpeople chris is the same as he was in batman forever although think his work in these is too hokey when he is best at quieter parts in scent of woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes alicia love the girl but she is not particularly good in this she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and it is not the mushymouth this time but in all fairness she has virtually no part joel gets around her occasionally and when she is on she does stupid stuff although know am not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens but she has no part it seems like joel had so much footage that he had edit almost an hour out of the final product there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed now listen me on this one in every batman flick there is couch scene in the original it was vicki in returns it was good makeout scene selena and in the last one it was chat nicole this one it is nothing and batgirl does nexttonothing in this till the end when she is suddenly part of the family fortunately we get lot of alfred he is the always reliable butler in case you did not know who has been bruce all his life he is god he is father figure he is also dying this got me love alfred almost as much as bruce and see him in robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets me we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but this is never answered as this is too cluttered but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma for one george is good batman but unfortunately gets nothing do and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum at one point they show the patients belongings in room and we see the riddlers costume laughed and during biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but bunch of badasses dressed as droogs from clockwork orange laughed at all these the falls apart around the fiveminute mark during an enormously long action sequence must last around minutes or did it just feel like that the should serve as another in the longline of films demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed up stupid films that is why the word of mouth killed the lost world that is why last year indy films grossed more than ever that is why this will have strong boxoffice initative from people who just want see it like me but will die after week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it that is why the next two bigbudget aciton pics are john woos faceoff and barry sonnenfelds men in black both are the first two catch on the wave early on like joel schumacher more as person than an artiste like some of his films flatliners time kill but lot of them suck he is really eccentric person and loved one of his quotes about how he admits being mediocre director and that is what makes him great but his costuming for woody allens sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number love the batman series the first two rocked and did like the last one but this one is not going be one that watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve as springboard better batman next time and maybe they will get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but we can only hope,0.0
writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book chuck pfarrer starring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso suppose am not extremely surprised that virus comes us from deciple of james cameron john bruno and if strain real hard could even say that it is an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr camerons early works in fact virus is yet another in the long line of actionhorrorparanoia thrillers from the aliens vein group of people are dropped into mysterious situation only find mortallythreatening entity is out get them textbook example hailing all the way back the early talkies and maybe even the first pictures albeit redeveloped cameron in his blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets come in his future no such thing will happen bruno whom believe worked in some capacity on that quasilandmark feature while bruno may have studied under camerons wing for years and years am beginning wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him in fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under man like cameron director who if anything just knows how make movie and then make like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this zgrade schlockfest of albeit zgrade schlockfest respectable budget the seems not only borrow it is plot from last years similarlyfated deep rising but also from clunkish bmovie from the called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenters twisted remake of the thing virus again has similar uh selling point group of sailors on boat stumble upon russian cruiser that is dead in the water they get on they break up into pairs and investigate and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of misquote in the dictionary ha ha not that any of this is for second scary or the least bit involving not only does this start off chintzy bondian opening the destruction of the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails bring us any interesting chracters of its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters lead woman skipper masculine potentialromanticinterest drunken captain black technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than thin plain piece of writing paper and it is not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all be eaten even aliens played the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of plusside for the as whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just do not give damn almost do not even have say that the acting from everyone ranges from subpar horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me say this as he is particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without second of credibility that this will go down as the performanceofwhichheshouldbeashamed like anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance or peter otoole in caligula great actor horrific performance it happens every now and then and it only helps sutherlands career that no one except for an elite few even bothered see this though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyones still trying catch up on the potential oscarnominees it does show that universal shelled out pretty penny make this it is laden complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course or anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place on large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the cliche seems go if it is dark enough then the special effects will be more believable and if you do not believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there is even one shot where we see godzilla either in his entirety in one wide shot or n the light so that we can at least see him well you do not really have sit through it again just take my word for it but all of this does not matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of movie the action scenes are muddled and as difficult follow as any action movie have ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other oceanextremeties the can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling me afterwards because sure could not figure it out when saw it imagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that is basically the whole of virus one horriblydirected action scene after the other capping it off proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least couple of the original cast members and my god it is long damn sit no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it is wonder that it even got made we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage drain little more out of the pool almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings universal heads when they gave this green light they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into director who might have very well been cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead the project only have bruno and company shit back in their face even though hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie would say even more contempt

this is your definitive movie extremely predictable following the basic formula horrible ending overzealous writing meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard make it exciting therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there fill space and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wiseass character of we have seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly was not used enough here am afraid the would have been completely unbearable in this ashley judd plays women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for weekend while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her over money how original while in jail she works out exercises and basically does her best get into near perfect condition now she has learned about law titled double jeopardy stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works now her po parole officer and bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not believe her claims skipping over the acting the fact that judd is more of looker than an actress no offense she has been good simon birch and even very good great kiss the girls at times in the past and believe may have the potential be better but she is terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying does not really add the movie at all just takes away as would said jones was fine although he did not have much work he was much more of supporting character is fine and he handled it well especially considering the material he had work feel this had alot going for it originality not being an issue the acting was the only thing as said keeping it alive the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better the action scenes were well made however sometimes out of place was just left unsatisfied in the long run so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely overthought the plot has certainly been done before generally speaking the movie moves way too fast for us get involved in either the characters or the plot and is basically that was almost saved tommy lee jones who if he had some more screentime could perhaps have earned the higher rating in my book anyway keep this in mind if you are in the mood for good action rent the fugitive,0.0
deadbang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up its dumb title or at least half of it although deadbang is definitely dead it is anything but bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore in the johnson plays you guessed it cop the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is gritty los angeles homicide detective real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and bleak outlook on life becks wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children she will not even allow him wish them merry christmas telephone but becks family and emotional problems take back seat the action and thrills in deadbang beck is investigating the brutal murders of shopkeeper and cop his investigation starts in a and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has violent showdown the killers at white supremacist camp virtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective the plot is incoherent and full of holes the movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions the action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii in all fairness frankenheimer however should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction deadbang tries don mask of social relevance incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting according the movies production notes deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck you would never guess this from watching deadbang however since the totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable most of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above william forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler wholesome bythebook fbi agent who is offended becks foul language and unorthodox methods forsythe is lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable deadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and franks place but his talents are completely wasted in cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of squadron of black cops who help beck nail the villains the sole function of penelope ann millers character is give deadbang an excuse include gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less guess the films title refers this love scene since it is definitely dead bang the only real virtue of deadbang believe it or not is don johnson who tries overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script johnson succeeds in giving his character sarcastic sense of humor and hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the life and must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments the funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over criminal as he interrogates him but when barf is the highlight of movie you know the movies in trouble the other amusing scene involves psychological examination of beck in he cannot keep straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen but two funny scenes and couple good wisecracks do not movie make,0.0
it was once said that in order truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels you must suspend disbelief however there is distinct separation between opening your mind ridiculous situations and believing bunch of flat lies it came as no surprise me learn that huntingburg indiana where the is set does not have mcdonalds sears store statue of man on horse nor even dam close even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial hard rains plot there is still bunch of things that just dont gel firstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and seen was cast as shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for healthy retirement he _should_ have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman as massive flood started dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases say presumably simply because we never know what happened them and it seems tad strange that an entire town the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started but nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesnt take long for the van end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road jim morgan freeman and small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt steal the three million dollars but of course tom is more than willing save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town the local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id and couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered greediness as each character contemplates what heshe would do their share of the three million dollars director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsyturvy and whilst the may at first appear be definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in its plot that make this slightly more enjoyable experience but the time these interesting changes occur its far too late in the for them have much affect hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par not at one stage capturing what could have been fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left reminisce on films that dared do something different and achieved more than what was expected such titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and faceoff nicholas cage and john travolta come mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations strangely enough they were both directed john woo and both star john travolta we can forgive morgan freeman for giving slightly disappointing performance since he is newish the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added his character if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough substantially boost movie prior the release of broken arrow my answer would have been definite no now know that he has no excuse and _can_ do better if you dont believe me rent copy of broken arrow from your local video store although hard rain never really works from the start somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen the addition of an enticing subplot would have given the time breathe rather than try cram minutes of action and disaster into story that cant handle anything else despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this be mildly enjoyable no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want do after shelling about is compare this other films,0.0

i have no real tangible proof of this but swear that there are lot of producers in who adamantly believe that if you take bad script written bad writer and give the project it an equally bad director then it is actually possible make good movie using their logic all that really needs be done change the bad movie into good movie is cast bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget this is the only way can fathom how th century fox hired jon amiel in order direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me get and from the theatre now before continue ferociously attack what is wrong this just want point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential be an exciting thriller catherine zetajones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery if you have ever seen any blockbuster before really do not have spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes the problem we come is that we have all seen this few billion times before and this does not break any new ground in the bigbudgethollywoodaction genre the result is that the entire production feels contrived am going be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones now while this may be compliment for ms zetajones it certainly is not for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are just about the most profound thought they can inject into this is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail an eighty million dollar budget you would think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx well you would be wrong the action that is present in this takes place in huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular unfortunately for all those involved entrapment die hard narrowly beat it the screen years the reality is that after minutes of watching this picture you know exactly what is going happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay throw in plot twists many scenes seem exist merely as reason outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing one particular scene features baker crawling around trying avoid laserbeams while she tries steal an ancient chinese mask nothing wrong that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why did not she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room will tell you why because it is great excuse photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zetajones and the most interesting character in the not even he can rescue this from the depths of the boring abyss concept invented just describe this picture one last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into shadow or behind building or he becomes obstructed moving vehicle and then in the next shot he will spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking himself it will leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that we know jon it is called editing,0.0
when originally saw the trailer for analyze this few months ago must admit thought it looked kind of lame and then when the commercials started popping up week or two ago thought it looked outright bad but then when analyze this finally opened few days ago an odd thing happened it got great reviews critics were proclaiming it hilarious and deadon parody of mob movies well praise like that figured it must be good and so headed off the theater you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts well turns out that expression is more valid than ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted do not get me wrong think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here think the problem is he did not quite know how approach this material he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been lot more successful as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others this does not work it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know it is him and the movie is badly paced too it never takes off it just crawls from one scene another without any forward momentum think the blame for this should be placed on the script it is obvious the writer had good idea for movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of psychiatrist but once this is established the movie does not really go anywhere the formula of the seems be this billy crystal says no deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie have said it before and will say it again the only thing that matters me in comedy is whether or not it is funny if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting would not have bothered me would have been too busy laughing notice but as it is only chuckled few times the only really funny scene is deadon parody of the godfather sadly though do not think anyone in the audience saw it realized it was parody because was the only one laughing but my sense of humour have come realize is vastly different from the general population loathed there is something about mary yet loved baseketball now if you want movie that think is funny go out and see office space it is full of genuine laughs and will not leave you glancing at your watch every minutes as analyze this did,0.0

there was probably good reason that the warner bros studio chose not allow critics view this steven seagal when it first opened and after seeing this piece of toxic waste now know why this movie is far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago fire down below centers its story on little mining town in gods country somewhere in eastern kentucky it is beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed an uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like he wants kill his agent for getting him this role it turns out that he is filling the mines throughout kentucky toxic waste for tidy profit seagal plays jack taggert an aikidoversed fighting machine who is an agent the epa no not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa it is the environmental protection agency had no idea that epa agents were trained be killers taggert is sent find the perpetrators and bring them justice written someone named jeb could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships banjopicking preachers and dumbasnails rednecks but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries discreetly fit in seagals idea of disguise is longlength leather jacket but get closer the kinfolk he will fix peoples porches for free that is another great epa asset teaching agents how fix porches slow and plodding this project is total mess the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige here his bravado basically turns into bullyness townsfolk who are foolish enough challenge seagal are quickly subdued fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever and his soap box message wears thin within the first minutes the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk take control of their lives and help clean up the environment but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets up seagal kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him go away seagal gallantly replies will leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth was expecting patriotic music start blasting and show of fireworks in the background this is truly nothing more than pompous showcase for seagals righteousness and narcissistic arrogance seagal has been vanguard in trying bring new genre into the filmplace that of the envirothriller on deadly ground however the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this still believe in preserving mother earth so save your and please donate it instead some worthy environmentally conscious charity,0.0
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning however they will not find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either joe matthew modine is struggling actor or he claims be one even though he has no credits under his belt his girlfriend mary catherine keener has no pretensions about her career she is makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair marlo thomas and supermodel of the month sahara bridgette wilson sahara who has acquired new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid has an onagain offagain relationship joes best friend bob maxwell caulfield however bob has gotten his biggest break yet starring role on soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly daryl hannah who may be that illusive woman he is always pursued real blonde there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde but not enough the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background such as saharas perfume ads depression it is not just state of mind but find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is shoot fish in barrel and unfortunately the films forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic take for example the films framing device of an old lady and her dog the story serves absolutely no purpose makes little sense and is completely tangential the main plotlines of the movie matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the but they are stuck in the most boring plotlines modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley who appears as another struggling actor keeners character has stronger edge but the insult selfdefense class taught denis leary no less she is stuck in makes little sense the movies running time is under two hours but it seems like it is well over it there is just not enough humor speed things along and not enough meaning propel any drama,0.0
the ads for batman and robin scream the event of the summer is here and that is the problem the producers were apparently so intent on creating spectacle that they forgot put an actual movie inside of it batman and robin is minutes of lavish sets flashy costumes and big confusing fight scenes barely hint of substance it is like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows bright busy and visually diverting but not very much fun it was not always this way tim burtons batman was an epic story of obsession and duality of darkness and revenge the while far from perfect was striking mood piece an otherworldly feel batman was creepy brooding creature of the night the joker brilliantly overplayed jack nicholson was at once charismatic and repellent batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin battling inner demons and one another over gotham citys breathtaking gothic skyline those days of the dark knight are gone replaced psychedelic ice capades run amuck batman and robin has far more in common the campy batman tv show than tim burtons tale of darkness the blame lies director joel schumacher former windowdresser schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes unfortunately when it comes time have those people walk and talk he has not the faintest notion of what do batman and robin is overstuffed intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it is often difficult tell who is whacking who while the characters flail at each other oneliners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of batman and robin does not merely lose momentum it stalls out completely on several occasions it is rare see an action flick as sluggish as this one ironically the parts of batman and robin that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne easily the best batman yet clooneys expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character sense of depth that the script does not even hint at the films most effective scene is tender quiet exchange between clooney and alfred michael gough bruce waynes butler and surrogate father as for the other heroes chris odonnells robin is enthusiastic perky and horny as hell while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl in movie filled the brim major characters the decision add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce waynes girlfriend is puzzling suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits builtin nipples shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight of course the real stars of batman are the villains and that is where batman and robin really suffers as mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years spitting out stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion laboring under ton of appliances schwarzenegger looks as if he is having trouble even moving in his suit let alone trying act uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character it is apparently rule in the batman series that before person becomes villain she must be cartoonish bumbling nerd once thurman transforms into the ecopsychotic poison ivy she does nice mae west impersonation as classic vamp who can seduce men her breath and kill them kiss thurman fails maintain the characters maniacal sense of style though and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the the biggest lesson be learned from batman and robin is that more is not better joel schumacher fills the screen eye candy but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what trifle the really is some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam do not think so my prescription fire joel schumacher but offer him ticket rubber fetishists convention so he will understand that there is no hard feelings give alicia silverstone her walking papers while keeping clooney odonnell and michael gough call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman then ditch the campiness and for the love of pete lose the event mentality and make movie instead of spectacle next time,0.0
gordy is not movie it is minutelong sesame street skit and very bad one at that this movie is so stupid and dumb that it is depressing think that some executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is disney movie am sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able tolerate it it is the story of farm piglet named gordy voiced garms whose family has been taken away up north we know means death of course we can hear the animals talk each other and they actually went the trouble of attempting sync the voices their mouths but it comes out terrible actually it is almost funny in way the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of truck and essentially steals him jinnie is country singer and the goes off on huge tangent show her little concert and the people dancing it what is the point of this maybe she is one of the producers relatives and they wanted show her on camera promote her or something we then cut huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board suit on nah did not see that one coming starts drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over him and saves him if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of food processing corporation when hanks grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune hank and gordy of course there must be villain but even this villain donadio as sipes is not that evil he never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story it is hard tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness the movie is intentional because it is family or if the filmmakers are just this untalented and stupid at times gordy is tolerable watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded but it is just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me see also babe,0.0

a slight romantic comedy feminist bent but one no edge it it turns out be conventional filled the usual clich and stock characters of this genre though it is wellwritten and wellacted fluff piece it still does not have too much say that is surprising it is made for the gentle arthouse set those who do not want something too disturbing think about it is about critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so selfabsorbed that he is threatened his department store floorwalking model wife kate bouquet who wants be writer she meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another selfabsorbed man and predictable relationship occurs the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husbands first impressions of her as someone who was impressed his genius and worships at his feet she now wants her own identity and her independence the looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued the cheap set design features reserved for tv movie the sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end its unspectacular climax it is set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances wealthy american shopper vanni she later meets him as her hubbys new upstart publisher who seeks have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order give him credibility as publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor her publishing her vanity novel alec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible live tries do everything stop his wife from having her book publishedwhich only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni the publisher is proud that he is mammas boy who never married and is selfmade man who has earned millions he has recently acquired failing old london publishing house and plans revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem could sell culture in europe the only thing that could not be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line the mystery me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soontobecomebeleaguered vanni when she writes second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did it ends the same results that happened hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in whimper business affair was loosely based on the reallife literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated love triangle,0.0
if you are the kind of person who goes see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you indeed this has got be either one of the most unimaginative ripoffs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them it is difficult fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this but at least we are warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity sneak on out and into the adjacent show what are the four ingredients of really bad action movie first the movie gives us an introductory premise huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared oooh scary secondly cheesy soundtrack tries connote tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears an abrasive musical score third the main character is mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams he operates sophisticated militarystyle pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him they are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts talk accents and try show how macho they are during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs spotting cruise ship in the distance they make their way the ocean liner and devise plan raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested some kind of ocean monster yet they board the ship armed the hilt grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in matter of seconds this is nothing more than bythebook action their realization of the situation that they are in does not happen until they are in the bowels of the boat those who are dumb enough stray off on their own will ultimately get killed the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scarefests must have yet despite the predictable nature of this there are some scary boo moments but most of it is just outright silly and this is unusually gory too monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains there is one particularly neat scene where monster has been cut apart and reveals victim that is still alive he screams horribly as the monsters digestive juices continue slowly eat him away additionally it borrows heavily from speed alien and bunch of other recent films the mercenaries even run into lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock be honest when left the theatre just had laugh at how witless the was it is moronic fun at best so if you are hankering for large bucket of popcorn served side of silliness then this might just hit the spot,0.0

deceiver is plot twist in search of movie this overly constructed succeeds in having many surprises and being true its title being deceptive but there is little in the that is worthy of deceit braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are two cops investigating the brutal murder of prostitute renee zellweger their lone suspect is wayland tim roth wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hookers pocket however routine lie detector test turns against the investigators as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables braxton and kennesaw are forced confront their own troubled lives braxton is gambling addict in deep mook ellen burstyn local bookie kennesaw is bitter about his marriage socialite rosanna arquette believing his wife be unfaithful the plot is twisty and complex lots of lengthy flashbacks and plenty of surprises however there are times when it is needlessly complex and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers important plot points actually get lost take look at a confidential or the films more likely inspiration the usual suspects for how complex plot can properly be handled the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot for example the tells few substories such as the tale of woeful absinthe bender or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable there is never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation they appear be nothing more than words on screenplay the characters themselves are rather pathetic and despicable not one of them is an ounce sympathetic and as result the labyrinthine plot is all for naught what does it matter who is guilty of what and why writerdirectors josh and jonas pate seem desire emulate the coen brothers masterwork blood simple or the wachowski brothers less worthy bound but while they have got the plot twists down cold they need work on characterization and dialogue,0.0
this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disneys live action george of the jungle tarzan and the lost city the latest attempt bring edgar rice burroughs legendary hero the big screen is one of the most inept and illtimed of any tarzan adventure so far badly conceived and poorly executed tarzan and the lost city appears headed for quick trip video store shelves have no idea why the producers chose now bring back tarzan it is not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie furthermore it is even more curious that this is rated pg definition rules out any sex or explicit violence and while am not advocating the excesses embraced the bo derek version of the story tarzan deserves slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production of course no tweaking of the content change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city since the films troubles originated the script and were propagated all the way down the line imagine george of the jungle stripped of all intentional humor and you have fair idea of what this tarzan is like its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences the barely registers pulse anyone in search of relatively entertaining family jungle adventure should check out the version of the jungle book uses the same basic elements much better effect the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery unfortunately includes the two lead actors the does not attempt retell the origin story the thinking is that it has been done often enough instead tarzan and the lost city introduces us lord graystoke k john clayton k tarzan the ape man casper van dien several days before his marriage lady jane porter jane march he is living happily in england enjoying the benefits of being landowning noble meanwhile in central africa the dastardly nigel ravens steven waddington selfproclaimed scholar and explorer believes he has found the way the lost city of opar he calls the cradle of civilization on the way there he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things like burning native villages earn the wrath of the locals one shaman determined stop ravens from unearthing opal sends mystical message tarzan for help lady jane following close behind he returns the jungle where he was born its patently obvious that casper van dien one of the prettyboy heroes of starship troopers was not hired on the basis of his acting ability his plastic facial expressions monotone voice and complete inability make convincing animal noises his range rivals that of steven seagal his pecs however are impressive and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity show them off jane march on the other hand has keep her shirt on may be first for her some six years ago march give solid performance in jean jacques annauds steamy the lover since then she made the careerkilling decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night exploited her every acting defiency tarzan continues this trend march may be attractive but at least judging this performance she cannot act meanwhile steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary be really detestable bad guy instead he turns out be little more than nuisance the story line is pure formula has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless the romantic elements are all contrived in fact lady janes presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued her buff fiance the special effects are truly bottomofthebarrel including some laughably bad men in ape costumes apparently animatronics were too expensive for this production and of course as all jungle movies there are the obligatory cute animals over the years the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for series material the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part including gordon scott who is widely believed be the best actor tackle the role weismuller made tarzan features van dien will probably fall short of that number and having seen tarzan and the lost city would argue that the moviegoing public would have been well served if he had missed,0.0
desperate measures is generic title for that is beyond generic it is also depressing waste of talent the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune the movie is big disappointment and yet it is somewhat easy see what motivated such big names attach themselves it the premise is both promising and intriguing too bad the executions all wrong though because the setup of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve be put far better use san francisco cop frank connor garcia is single parent troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken cancer only bone marrow transplant can push into remission even worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society connor tries his best convince mccabe go along the surgery he is at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital when he does make run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want take mccabe down while connor needs keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy one misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness what is needed are more details as exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him attempting keep mccabe alive are just little too hard swallow take for example scene where mccabe is trying make getaway climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems think that mccabe will eventually get and try harm his son whatever be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems first and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of it is opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour once mccabe escapes the becomes the fugitive in reverse and no thrills there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up keaton only have him grab hostage and get away also the movie is so intent on giving you hootinducing lipsmacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcias frank connor the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movies headscratcher of sendoff confirms this there is some good be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department cast against type michael keatons understated menace is highly effective although he is not given much believable work andy garcia plays off taut emotional chord joseph cross as garicias ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as doctor who becomes major player in the unfolding chaos this cast does its best camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost it goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own,0.0

so it is thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again that might have been an exciting notion if it was not for the fact that the odd couple of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies grumpy old men grumpier old men and out sea e grumpiest old men so the odd couple ii e the grumpiest old men of all really seems just another entry in tired series the plot is even similar that of grumpy old men in that lemmon and matthaus mismatched characters are brought together romance between their children oscars son jonathan silverman and felixs daughter lisa waltz are getting married and former roommates felix ungar lemmon and oscar madison matthau meet at the airport and decide share car then hilarity ensues well few chuckles ensue anyway neil simon the awardwinning playwright who created oscar and felix provides the screenplay is shock because the script is piece of talentless hackwork from beginning end unlike the original playmovie odd couple ii does not find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters instead it depends upon series of humorous situations oscar and felix lose the car over cliff are caught smuggling mexicans over the border take up two women on the run from their violent husbands the women are played christine baranski of cybill and jean smart of designing women and hitch ride man who dies in the desert the original movie the odd couple remains classic comedy it introduced the motif of roommateasspouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since it was the second outing for the lemmonmatthau team debuted in the fortune cookie and they made couple more worthwhile comedies the front page and buddy buddy before going their separate ways the reunion of lemmon and matthau in grumpy old men six years ago was delightful and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie but out sea and the odd couple ii are just beating grumpy old horse you can add lemmons my fellow americans e grumpy old presidents that list too let us hope that offers these two actors something fresh do let us hope also that we see neil simons name on movies that do it justice this is his first since lost in yonkers,0.0

mulholland drive did very well at the cannes festival as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international festival it may not be clear the viewer why am so negative on this for most of the running time in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the industry toward the end of the think everything that has been built falls apart the was be pilot for tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and think he decided that he wanted do something else it something else is what he did the opens woman played laura harring about be killed in car when car crash saves her life she crawls away from the accident concussion and finds herself bungalow an unlocked door sleep meanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in from canada she wants build career as an actress betty is little surprised find woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow she does not know who the woman is she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is they fix on name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not meanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own he is trying cast one actress for his new and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george these two threads are joined third one in there is strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong there is also strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding the confusion in what was probably intended for the television pilot the opens great vibrancy showing dancing style under the credits lot of mulholland drive starts out fun lynch wants you know he could make an enjoyable stylish he just chooses not as any david lynch there is strange material added for little reason there are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches the is little long for the subject matter toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot unfortunately some of the most important comments make about this would be spoilers will not mention them in the main body of the review but give mulholland drive on the scale and low on the scale mulholland drive spoiler warning have rated this fairly low you should read this only after seeing the or deciding that you will not see the david lynch is in large part dark satirist most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside in mulholland drive think he is having laugh at the expense of the crime genre what he does this is are you sure you want read this playing off the audience expectations that there will be simple explanation for what is going on the first of the he tells simple multithread crime story clues sprinkled throughout then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear large number of clues that appear that they should add up something the audience expectation is that they will add up but he has given clues that are selfcontradictory lynch wants the audience argue about what they have seen afterward and come up theories in fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until hear better explanation think lynch is merely playing joke there is visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties mad magazine called it poiuyt other sources called it tri pronged ubar look at small portions of it and makes sense look at the whole figure and it does not this is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of tripronged ubar,0.0

watching the movie vowed subtract half star from the review because the filmmakers included saccharine syrup cute cuddly computergenerated monkey if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs what that means is that lost in space actually deserved stars that is pretty generous considering the movies camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed buy it so why such seemingly high rating there are few reasons that made me unable throw away the experience the garbage first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of brand new theater the sound and screen kicked ass nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and do not necessarily mean that in good way also there were more than zero scenes where found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movies tension even liked the computergenerated settings usually prefer see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than have seen in lot of movies it looks like someone spent little overtime render some of the futuristic cities also gary oldman is never bad actor even though he is typecast as villain william hurt is not too bad either neither actor had great role but their performances were watchable and perhaps should not admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back my childhood there is very little swearing or blood there is strong moral message saccharine though it is there is bit of romance whose culmination after hours is real kiss no sex it felt like one of those disney movies that so looked forward when was six those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven that type of moviemaking is lost art now for the bad news worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue it is squeakyclean family fun trying hard be as hip as pulp fiction you better hold on your joystick is one such line and when robinson is called upon deliver line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign second worst and closely related is the screenplay the storys exposition takes place at press conference allows the writers explain what is happening the least amount of creativity effort or interest once the story gets going do concede momentary burst of interest once in while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived when gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch evil then there is the tone of the movie the colorado daily said the would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson then it could be an adventure movie they are mostly right except that johnson will was not good enough actor carry it off still that the has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows lack of imagination just because movie is tame enough for kids does not mean that we have bow promise keepers notion of who is the center of family many quality family films have been made nontraditional family structure fly away home comes mind much better effect and the politics of the time seem bit conservative and regressive for futuristic movie in star wars the rebels were the good guys we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize the terrorists finally few specific details deserve criticism the movie tells us that the setting is the year why why bother saying what year this is just tell us it is the future bring it up because the tv series was supposed take place in setting specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it will not be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway then there is scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on chair that rises about fifteen feet on pole this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair and only shows that the future is time when spaceship designers have not learned thing about ergonomics one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the failed it made lost in space look cool the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip this is overlaid on cool jumpy credit sequence interesting distorted clips from the movie but if that is the best part of the movie cannot in good conscience recommend it still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards,0.0

as any genx mtv movie like last years dead man on campus the movie is marketed for primarily male audience as indicated its main selling points sex and football those two items wrapped in guiltypleasure package are sure snare sizeable box office chunk initially but sales will decline for two reasons first the football sequences are nothing new nor can they be the sports genre is not mainstream and it is been retread death second the sex is just bad despite the appearance of whipped cream bikini or the allnight stripclub party there is nothing even remotely tantalizing the acting is mostly mediocre not including the fantastic jon voight cultivating his usual sliminess voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twentytwo conference championships and two state titles in thirty years this year he plans make it twentythree unfortunately when his star quarterback lance harbor paul walker goes down for the count he is got rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon james van der beek moxon leads the team through its last four games and then must cope his newfound stardom the effect it has on his relationship girlfriend julie amy smart and other temptations that abound in footballcrazy west canaan most regions of the country are not nearly as footballcrazy as texas and so the atmosphere is likely be lost on most similarly the set design is wrong for high school setting the teams are decked out sparkling uniforms radio headsets never seem work however and instead require coaches signal plays manually and even giant bronze statue of coach kilmer these elements as well as the heavy drinking and carousing might be more appropriate on college campus but mtvs core audience is the high school demographic this focus is further emphasized the casting james van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero although he never manages do anything the role other stars are similarly young and unmemorable there is not much that goes right about varsity blues and there is not much like about it either everything herein has already been done and if it has not the movie manages botch it one way or another this is certainly missable,0.0

the animal is marginally inspired comedy that only manages lumber along generating just enough momentum keep it from stalling it is clunky and slow like watching an wheeler trying accelerate up hill there are certainly better things you can do your time actually if you have seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments the story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns be real officer but he is afflicted loseritis dogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his coworkers ignore him truthfully his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor we would probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun this is actually bad because you cannot like character if you cannot develop sympathy for him we never do and it may be just as well that he drives off cliff and plummets the canyon floor however marvin is found an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses radical and experimental procedure save him implanting our doofus various animal parts and organs as result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on body swim the speed of dolphin and can run as fast as cheetah imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him however the spirit of the takes raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges goats beware he also chases cats urinates mark his territory or growls at his enemies what he should have done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich equally tenuous is its other running joke involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he is black it is reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything this element does not work the first time it is mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite every recurrence you do not have be as wise as an owl realize that the animal is tame if there is any reason see this it is see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut remember her she was voted off in week of the week program survivor here she plays marvins sunny love interest while her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like lapping dog yuck her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be meg ryan in the making it is too bad that she is in such mediocre offering,0.0

young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that did not stop it from becoming phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time in the s warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby become the latest rage from down under personally am hoping americans everywhere will rise the occasion and make young einstein box office bomb young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the but also starred and did his own stunts his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you would expect from someone named yahoo the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the finds him still living his parents on tasmania remote australian island in addition deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar yahoo plays einstein as naive and unrefined country hicka clown an insatiable curiosity although yahoos performance is at first endearing the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc yahoo has created charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever but after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into poor excuse for comedy young einstein is hampered its lethargic pace and inane plot yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing almost every other scene includes blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching movie or music video the instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly great comic effect halfway through young einstein knew for sure the movie was stinker but it was not until the very end that finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy primetime sitcoms in fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor would not raise any eyebrows,0.0

come on surprise me stop giving us these poorly written thrillers banal dialogue sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset the always watchable morgan freeman plays detective who becomes personally involved in case involving missing girls personal because his niece is one of the victims it is slobbering psychopath of course but this time there is twist freeman notes that each of the young women who have disappeared are all strong willed assertive and more successful in their careers than the average girl we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova whose aim is dominate these modern gals imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem anyway one of the women manages escape ashly judd and teams up freeman well you know the rest brief glance at the plot silence of the lambs this is constantly being compared the hype merchants may suggest lambs also has fairly predictable story perhaps but that also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue so lets not insult great movie taking the comparisons any further okay and as for comparisons seven oh please kiss the girls is based on the novel james patterson and written for the screen one david klass maybe the novel was stinker start but whatever the case it is the writing that is clearly at fault here one these characters have very little say that is engaging or interesting two the script has no sense of humour three while the notion of psychos victims being smart successful women is an interesting twist the execution is not even half as good as the idea thus ashly judd comes across all out of focus instead of being the heart of the story we cannot feel her rage some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed remind us that she is the nobullshit type but these conversations barely register and as for freeman kiss the girls is his second dog in year first chain reaction now this for an actor of his calibre this is most worrying young director gary fleder scored hit few years back his quirky pulp fictionesque things do in denver when your dead but what can he do material as resolutely mediocre as this not much and you can hardly blame him there is few wellstaged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls dives and jumps and the effect is startling but the script is beyond rescue what hurts most is that continues get away serving up this tripe safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up complacency rules it is been so long since we saw mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket the movie was freebie positive proof that the best things in life are not free,0.0
james brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns the big screen this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen he is racist homophobic and never has good word say anyone so nobody talks him except waitress carol conelly v sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear who nicholson hates all hit it off in the end like good will hunting and titanic even though the outcome is completely obvious as good as it gets is an enjoyable funny and warm comedy nicholson is hilarious as melvin churning out insults superb relish only nicholson could get away the lines that melvin delivers hunt is also good as waitress carol and easily rises the challenge of nicholson there is also thankfully bit of chemistry between them kinnear as the gay neighbor seems have slightly underwritten role he is more of plot convience than character although his performance is good his character just seems exist help melvin and carol come together in fact the scene stealer is simons dog who is funnier than nicholson but then again pets are always cute on screen providing solid support is cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire and yeardly smith who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons although gooding is not as good as is character in maguire he is still fun he overacts little but not so much as be annoying smith is also good although she has fairly small role even director lawrence kasdan body heat makes an appearance as doctor but this is primarily nicholsons and every scene he is in he is steals it he is character is so hateful though it is amazing that anyone talks him at all especially carol and this is the films main problem it is totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin she does not fall in love him naturally the forces her fall in love him also melvins character seems go too nice too quickly would doubt anyone character like melvins would be able turn back nice loving person it would take helluva long time much longer than this would like make out brooks direction is good though if bit average but he usually manages get an emotion out of the audience he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones he tends pile on much schmaltz but generally he is good there is also nice soundtrack veteran composer hans zimmer but generally as good as it gets achieves what it sets out do is make the audience feel good the end of the movie the movie is bit overlong but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes pretty quickly overall as good as it gets is fun movie even though it may be unbelivable and certainly worth seeing if just for jack nicholsons performance not quite as good as it gets pardon the bad joke but still good fun,1.0
after stylistic detour mrs parker and the vicious circle despite its uncomfortable tone was close being conventional movie director alan rudolph has returned his unique brand of making afterglow romantic black comedy about love betrayal and selfabsorption while these may not be the most unusual themes fashion into motion picture rudolphs atypical approach the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing if not always pleasant movie it is said that rudolph is polarizing director meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it until mrs parker had not been overly impressed his movies found equinox his last pre mrs parker effort be irritating and frustrating was somewhat surprised therefore discover that liked afterglow there are several reasons for this but the paramount one is that rudolph seems have muted some of the most strident mannered aspects of his approach the characters here are more like real people genuine problems the story is absorbing and the acting is topnotch in short rudolph has created world that it is worth spending two hours in afterglow introduces us two unhappily married couples jeffrey byron jonny lee miller is cold seeminglyheartless businessman who is sexually indifferent his young wife marianne lara flynn boyle for her part marianne is so obsessed having baby that she never attempts interact her husband on human level all she is interested in is seducing him during those few days when she is ovulating after he refuses make love she decides find someone else play the role of sperm donor the other couple lucky nick nolte and phyllis mann julie christie are an older pair but they are no more content than jeffrey and marianne mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart they remain married as matter of convenience but since phyllis will not allow lucky touch her they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as result of these affairs the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as handyman fix up the inside of the apartment she shares jeffrey the two of them are immediately attracted one another and it does not take long before they are lounging together naked in her pool meanwhile jeffrey who is captivated older women runs into phyllis in hotel bar is smitten and invites her accompany him on weekend retreat the mountains the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love sex means something different everyone jeffrey it is an unpleasant chore loss of control marianne it is means maternal end lucky it is an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles and phyllis it is method of establishing or denying emotional closeness ultimately none of these characters appears love anyone else as much as they love themselves the greatest strength of the lies not in the script but in the performances jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish callous suitandtie businessman those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity lara flynn boyle who was not impressive in rudolphs equinox is greatly improved making marianne jumble of sexiness and vulnerability nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky and he manages deliver some of rudolphs most pregnant lines practiced ease the clear standout however is julie christie who is nothing short of delicious as the worldweary phyllis her often wry occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the films humor and there is hardly ever moment when she does not steal the spotlight from her costars do not know if afterglow is the convert rudolph detractors but it seems that this movie is little more accessible than some of the directors earlier productions enough of his trademark style remains however reassure his supporters afterglow is basically fourpronged character study the plot is not especially compelling but the character interaction is and that is the real reason see this motion picture rudolph has painted an able picture of the nonromantic side of love the one that has more do tolerance and familiarity than affection and attraction,1.0
the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made it takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story that is totally believable throughout this is not an overthetop action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story real sense of mystery it and it works perfectly harrison ford stars as dr richard kimble man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in straightforward manner we constantly see flashbacks the murder from kimbles perspective hints are dropped from various times of the night kimbles wife helen sela ward was murdered we do not get see who the killer is until much further into the story in fact we might even have little doubt about kimbles innocence ourselves the does not spend much time on the details of kimbles trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get botched escape attempt his fellow inmates leads fantastic train wreck but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful watch this movie is so incredible because it is able take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard u marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives from the moment he appears we know huge game of cat and mouse is about occur kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way tell how one is going outsmart the other most of the deals richards complex investigation as he tries find the onearmed man who killed his wife ford does not have lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohys script and daviss outstanding direction that make the as great as it is just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting we know just as little as he does as why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills hunt him down at one point they run into each other and great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them he leaves clues for gerard show his innocence and help him solve the mystery one of the greatest charms the is its sense of humor there is great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck they are trying catch what they believe be dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk each other making funny wisecracks and oneliners but not in any kind of distracting manner the final act concludes another terrific chase richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get typical fight scene the case is far from solved the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we do not realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together maybe the finally scene is bit much but it still has believable atmosphere it we are so relieved when justice is served it is not the plot is that makes the fugitive great it is all the motions the characters go through make for an intriguing story watching seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous if only could produce more movies like this see also nick of time,1.0
i think that any competent member of the human race who is ever seen movieany moviecould probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer even though try very hard not predict films as am watching them especially not romantic comedies the plot of this particular just advanced before me seconds and sometimes minutes before actually saw it happen on screen but do not care not even little my reasons for this are simple adam sandler is great drew barrymore is great the movie is so funny there are parts that left me gasping for air because was laughing so hard have not laughed this hard in movie since austin powers sandler plays robby hart wedding singer who once had dreams of being in rock band and writing his own music in the opening scenes he seems like happygolucky wedding singer at least partially enjoying his profession and doing rather good job of talking down really drunk individual steve buscemi who decides that his brothers wedding is good place tell the whole world that his life up that point was utter pointlessness week later at his own wedding he is left standing at the altar his exfianc linda angela featherstone his life in complete disarray he meets julia barrymore waitress she is engaged glenn matthew glave and is marry him in about three months julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him help the wedding plans soon and predictably it becomes pretty clear that glenn is jerk and that robby and julia really love each other oh sure it is trite and if anyone making this expected us like feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer then they truly underestimated their audience what makes the story bearable aside from the terrific costumes and music are the performances barrymore is simply adorable here have never seen her look so close the way she did in et not only is she pleasant look at but her acting job here really is good oneand it does not hurt that the character is likable and adequately wellwritten and the jerk played in fullforce graves is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy have ever seen naturally the true star here is sandler think the guy is flatout hilarious he can say something that just is not funny and his delivery makes me laugh his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore but in this he goes much further and proves me that he can indeed hold his own as leading man in romantic comedy whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler the wedding singer gives him character that for the first time he actually has fit into as far as am concerned he succeeded and this is testimony that he does in fact have some range in his talents and the movie is just so funny perhaps the best moment is when he sings song for julia that he claims is little uneven because he began writing it while in good mood and finished it after his fianc abandoned him this is the part that literally had me groping for breath of air and while the like all romantic comedies takes hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has finish up there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half my formal complaints for the wedding singer are not very important the is predicable but who cares the characters are extremely likable the movie is ridiculously funny and the experience is simply enjoyable in addition this cannot imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting see the in that order conclude that it is pointless for me even have written this review just want everyone know that laughed lot,1.0
based on the boris karloffs classic the same name the mummy starts off the highpriest of osiris imhotep who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished being mummified in the most horrifying way possible bandaged up having his tongue removed and being covered in flesheating scarab beetles then entombed all while still alive recap few thousand years later where soldier named rick played brandan fraser aids young historian named evelyn played rachel wiesz and her brother jonathan played john hannah in finding the book of amon ra in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy problem is that the mummy wants revive his mistress using evelyn as sacrifice walking in relatively low expectations thought this movie was actually pretty good the visuals and cgi are astounding and obviously not cheaply done at all they pack ton of detail into the images especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely cgi the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes such as unnerving moments involving flesheating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him after all those who took his artifacts are cursed unfortunately the attempts be way too much in such short span of time becoming tug of war for control between genres on one hand it is fast paced action on the other it is frightening horror and on the side it is hilarious comedy ideally for it be successful the would have focus on one the more action oriented aspect one character serving as the comic relief that would be johnson the problem this is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief rick occasionally delivering his witty oneliner if they were trying make horroractioncomedy it would have helped if it were established early on in the but unfortunately the backstory of imhoteps entombment that would be impossible and then there is the slapstick fight scene between swordwielding rick and an army of mummies while really well done it had the feel of slapstick comedy replace the sword chainsaw and you would effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness while entertaining and funny it feels really out of place but at least it is break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing lot of on the whole the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning end entertaining the audience but must end my review plea movie theatre owners turn the sound down while lot of theatres have good sound systems my ears were almost ringing as walked out of the theatre the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you are not careful when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger end of days it was so loud could not make anything out,1.0
on rewatching italian writerdirector dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae was struck more than anything else how many sins he commits as storyteller and manages get away in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries while it is certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it be nonetheless densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller the story follows promotional visit rome famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that serial killer is on the loose inspired his latest book tenebrae the police on his back for leads he decides take personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into mystery where all is not as it seems the benefits enormously from fine central performance franciosa he brings grace charm and deceptive benigness his character provides an interesting foil both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him the is awash fascinating psychosexual tension argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become dangerous business tenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here it may take at least two or three viewings appreciate all the psychological themes at play in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso the fulllength italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes needless say for argento fans there is no denying the directors brilliance as stylist many of the action and murder sequences are directed his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this argento creates mood filling his scenes light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria instead tenebraes set design and lighting paints sleek clinical chilly vision of vaguely futuristic urban world and the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment so tenebrae has much recommend it no question still constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative some critics argue that logic does not matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films the point where viewers do not deserve feel cheated the way if you do not want know the solution the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist properly handled could have proved ingenious we witness the murder of the serial killer himself man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal he is insane apparently the murders then continue for the remainder of the as neal decides it is time settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife he is finally revealed us as this second killer in the films bloody climax but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively you see we are supposed be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house but thanks poor editing its had believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway bad cutting puts the timing way out in other words he is almost in two places at once during this crucial scene we are also thrown ridiculous red herring the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted nasty injury in this earlier scene make it look like he was attacked fleeing assailant the injury he banged himself on the head bloody great rock thus the revelation of the hero as killer and antihero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible the time the end credits have rolled helpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the belonged neal all along but there too is problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy say the least the story owes us better understanding of franciosas mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage tenebrae is also marred annoying little inconsistencies for instance teenage boy and girl leave hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of motorbike we would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out be some male character we are not even introduced too that is careless filmmaking pure and simple why you may ask do go on about the storys flaws because when it comes visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts guard dog the point where almost unbelievably it jumps high fence and chases her across town finally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair it is an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating wealth of information through visuals alone and that is exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating too often it seems argentos films as whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts mind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth look and if you are fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then it is essential see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography luciano tovoli it is stylish greatlooking and quirky despite the problem narrative shame because it does not have be that way take argentos more recent stendhal syndrome where the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache proof that he can do it if he tries,1.0
as any sociologist will attest your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them live healthy and productive lives but if your upbringing is marred violence hate and dysfunctionality then your journey towards happy adulthood will be saddled psychological obstacles almost too great overcome affliction explores how man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood the man in question is wade whitehouse nick nolte here is man who is like any other citizen on the surface he is productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me but as you scratch beneath the surface something scary and evil begins rear its ugly head we see that he is meantempered person he has hard time taking control of his emotions usually gets the better of him he is quick apologize for his actions and wants be gentle person but something is sparking tendency towards violence he also has tremendous problems relationships he is divorced and his only connection love is his daughter but his bearish persona and stature alienates her he is visibly shaken her rejection even though she says that she loves him his demeanor also puts his relationship local townsgirl sissy spacek at risk she tries remain true him and supportive but for women unlucky enough attach themselves this kind of person relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending an exclamation point finally he is spiteful and vindictive as rejected father he initiates custody battle that seems hopeless as the towns only police officer he issues speeding ticket man whose father has just died we can see that this is man that is both afflicted and living pain he is prisoner and slave it he is moving towards level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension what kind of force can move man the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him we learn that the answer is his father james coburn this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed have and that any woman would be afraid meet he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules an iron fist we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks heighten the fathers churlishness the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken very frightened person very effective today wades dad is quite elderly but still manages instill fear into grown man the influence that the father possesses is inescapable and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade the result is every sons nightmare becoming like the father that one has always dreaded be this is terrifically presented piece of psychological drama and nolte turns in strong performance as man whose pain seems become detriment as well as necessity he is hulking person who is still reduced whimpers when in the presence of his father coburn displays heft as the bitter dad but it is most certainly not saturdaynightfriendly fare there is nothing light or fluffy about this that may turn many moviegoers away but it is certainly worth noting that this is wellacted drama showcasing noltes and coburns raw acting talents,1.0

i am not quite sure how best go about writing this review must admit that was little disappointed barry levinsons political satire wag the dog but in retrospect this has less do the itself than false expectations had going into it quite few of the reviews have read led me believe that this was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through and it did not do that they also led me believe that it would deliver vicious and alltootrue attack on the way the american political media works and it did not quite do that either few of them even suggested that it would prove worthy successor stanley kubricks dr strangelove in the tradition of political black comedy and it most definitely did not do that that said wag the dog is actually very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean robert deniro distract the american public from the accusations that the president who is up for reelection in two weeks sexually harassed young girl in the oval office the accusations the script suggests are probably untrue but as brean so pointedly puts it that is not particularly relevant the scandal is likely derail the presidents campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood brean along his assistant anne heche decide contact producer stanley motss dustin hoffman enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and specialeffects trickery make it appear that the s is going war albanian terrorists and thus propel the president victory on wave of patriotic fervor as said wag the dog is not quite as laughoutloud hilarious as had expected but there are some genuinely funny moments be found here such as when in an echo of familiar movie clich the camera pans out over an urban sunset the strains of uplifting inspirational music then cuts studio reveal that the singing is coming from group of musicians whom motss has assembled perform we have the right fight for democracy another scene shows us how modern editing equipment an actress running across sound stage bag of potato chips can be turned into frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing terrorist attack on her village the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda teams attempt forge fictional war hero out of sgt william old shoe schumann woody harrelson an exmilitary officer who turns out be firstclass psycho of course not everything goes as planned the cia for example realizes what is going on and strikes deal the presidents electoral opponent report the media that the fighting has ended forcing motss and brean come up new angle on the supposed albanian crisis still even the cias involvement the falls little short in terms of making this scenario believable regardless of the official word from the president or the cia would not the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is in fact no fighting going on in albania the never addresses this question nor does it show the reactions of the american public the news of the apparent war except for few scenes border on the farcical such as when basketball fans litter the court shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt schumann we are apparently meant assume that everyone is buying it there was also an instance towards the end of the in one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems contradict what he and brean had been selling the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away these plot holes wag the dog does not quite work as satire of american politics but it does send up the mentality that might lead these kinds of machinations in the first place brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical rather they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money pull it off the takes decidely dark turn towards the end as we learn how far they are willing go in order keep the propaganda campaign secret motss and his buddies meanwhile seem completely out of touch the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project in fact one of the sources of conflict in the is motsss increasing restlessness the idea of not being able take credit for producing the fake war in his mind it is the greatest work of art he has ever created think it is fair say that wag the dog underachieves little bit more attention the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into fourstar and classic satire still the issue of an american president using war and patriotism distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is very real one wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks what if the war was not even real this premise and the talented cast the still delivers more consistently than most whatever its flaws,1.0

it is easy label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing child whether that may be in life or in death after having said that will also say that this movie does all of the above very well one gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for costly mistake or when husband hugs his wife after long estrangement there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people in fact the only thing remotely connected the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie so what are the lessons learnt do not take your children class reunions do not leave them alone in the lobby not even for second michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of highlystrung wife and mother trend that started thousand acres and one fine day my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing lesbian cop name that makes one want reach for lollipop lastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes mind,1.0
i know that funnest is not word fun is noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that is the word that came me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you childish expressions like that was the funnest movie have ever seen so hell websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies have seen in while cannot remember the last time have seen anything funner the chickens at tweedys farm are up something living in concentration camplike atmosphere they are led one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises teach the chickens how fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides abandon the farms eggselling plan for pieselling plan she orders huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming codirector peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference the ballbouncing scene some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the does not feel like it is been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up the idea make prisonersofwar movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it is worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and them it is but they are chickens so it is funny us another thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods the very films they are cribbing there are references the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there is even nod the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and history the braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year have seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they are parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run does not lean on its parodies the references are never the sole focus of any scene if you have never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it is understood and as result chicken run is filled visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie does not require knowledge of history but if you have got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it is hard not fall in love every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but soft heart that forbids her leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gungho veneer the characters inevitable romance does not feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly is not any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence they even come up an inspired riff on something that is baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke come off as wearisome but as most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise the manages cross all barriers it should be accessible both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is firstrate remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention detail as in such topnotch family fare as bugs life or toy story chicken run has something offer in nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they will catch all the details anyway the movies just boatload of fun funnest damn movie have seen all year,1.0

just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add record store and you have got high fidelity or maybe the other way around since nick hornbys novel high fidelity came first either way it is been done before trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny why is this maybe because you know your life is much better than this you know these guys are more pathetic than you are and you know its ok laugh at them because they are fictional director stephen frears possibly not intentionally has created movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours day when watching high fidelity expect laugh at someone elses pain realize what you are laughing at and then laugh again laughed at dick todd louiso the shy timorous steve buscemi character of lebowski who seems know what he is talking about but either cannot put it into words or is harshly rejected his friends laughed at the john goodman character barry jack black an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons pudgy egotistic and obnoxious at the same time and laughed at rob john cusack the jeff bridges type whom the story revolves around rob is the character easiest relate but he is nothing like you at all he uncontrollably cheats and lies then is unable realize why he can not hold onto woman and like his other miserable friends pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers obscure trivia or listening new music and either deriding it or praising it whatever human emotions the clash aretha franklin and bruce springsteen records hold rob and co grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in during this confused stage of his life in the movie focuses on rob is trying cope numerous rejections over the years visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him but these are not any girlfriends these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob robs incessant use of lists show how pop music has played major role in his life the plot in three words is women and music the approach director stephen frears takes having the charismatic rob speak directly the camera is very effective it gives high fidelity quickly paced informal structure adjectives perfectly parallel robs own lifestyle it also helps open the viewers eyes as how annoying barry is jack black steals the show hilariously realistic performance as total sleaze ball just listening him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob who must work him every day of the week what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast consisting of big stars and character actors that really defines rob now instead of rob just talking the camera after he explains something the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying say the only problem high fidelity is that it does not end when it should have ended instead the movie goes on for torturous twenty minutes that seem lot longer than that also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in brief cameo halfway through the movie high fidelity is cheerful old fashioned comedy voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs just hope keeps creating losers on the big screen they make everyone look and feel great,1.0
plot human space astronaut accidentally falls upon planet ruled apes he is taken prisoner along some other humans and tries his best escape his simian captors oh yeah and did mention that the apes can talk kewl critique despite this not looking like tim burton movie or its lead human character showing any signs of being human being himself did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this and do recommend it as fun summer fare although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape makeup jobs and characterizations mean was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real also have give it up all of the actors inside the costumes not only for waking up at three in the morning every day get makeup slobbered all over them for hours but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well especially enjoyed bonham carters performance who believed be the most developed character in the entire human or ape and tim roths bad guy who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in he took part plotwise liked the beginning of the the whole buildup once wahlberg got into the village the escape and most of the fight scenes but once things got out into the deserted area and the final battle sequence kinda lost bit of my interest was much more intrigued the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of human beings as animals then was about the end battle sequence just seemed bit too typical for this kind of also hated the kid character who just got on my nerves and did not really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved will not ruin it here but cmon guys you coulda thought of something little more plausible than that no but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared either one of his interspecies love interests this dude did not seem give rats ass about anyone but himself and ultimately did not really care about what happened him either now am not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script but the suffered because of it visually the movie was also nice look at especially the apes but definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton the surprise ending that highlighted the original planet of the apes back in felt little tacked on here and despite being interesting did not really make all that much sense me unless you look at it from sequel point of view so overall loved the whole feel of the planet the apes that ruled it the manner in they treated the humans screamed shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain but did not appreciate the films lack of human character development why was kris kristofferson even in this movie and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring but would still recommend this as fun summer movie laughs creepiness and really cool premise ps for anyone who has seen the original cannot believe that they did not at least bring back the scene in the lead human character in this case mark wahlberg goes nuts at the world in he is suddenly been thrust this is mad house type of thing the guy in this barely seems be put off the fact that he is surrounded apes who can speak english where is joblo coming from the arrival battlefield earth godzilla instinct mission mars pitch black planet of the apes sleepy hollow,1.0
disaster films have tendency be very formulated and very cliched see disaster actual originality or at least decent plot twist would definitely be welcome surprise unfortunately folks it is not likely dantes peak is cliched and at times corny but also pretty decent be honest was not very interested in seeing this and word of mouth as well as several reviews did not make it sound promising so was pleasantly surprised that find that this movie was not bad at all it is pretty run of the mill but it is not something would say is merely ok watch in case you do not know dantes peak is about volcano and the city lives in it is shadow dantes peak who would have guessed eh pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent study the volcano and perhaps more hunch than actual scientific proof is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future due the lack of more substantial evidence nobody warns the small town and when they finally do it is in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows brosnan all around good guy will of course save the day or at least the mayor of dantes peak linda hamilton naturally the two will become infatuated one another if you think just ruined plot development you have not seen very many movies there is also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog tug at your heart strings and of course the kids or the dog at least one or the other will do something heroic but hey do not want ruin all the surprises if there was part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored be waste of time urge you watch it and decide for yourself it is not brain food but it succeeds at what it is meant be an enjoyable suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash,1.0

warning this review contains some spoilers for the failsafe if you have not seen the yet proceed caution nutshell relevant intelligent suspenseful drama still powerful today even after the end of the cold war failsafe usa drama minutes screenplay walter bernstein based on the novel eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced max youngstein directed sidney lumet review jamahl epsicokhan the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it does not have winning side and losing side in nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire worldassuming the world survives the ideaand perhaps the only real optionis avoid war at all costs this is the theme of sidney lumets failsafe fictional drama based on the novel eugene burdick and harvey wheeler failsafe takes place during the heart of the cold war the actual was released two years after the cuban missile crisis when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in single word communism the premise centers around combination of accidents and operation flaws five s bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered set routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america the unidentified aircraft turns out be commercial airliner but mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers suddenly out of contact and standing orders remain on course until receiving new directives the bomber pilots cannot be recalled and they proceed moscow the intention of destroying it nuclear strike great deal of failsafe plot follows various characters as they attempt devise ways of stopping the s bombers from reaching russias bordersat any cost the plot is compelling and the story creates urgency and dread painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios the reality sets in quickly as one attempt turn the bombers after another fails general bogan frank overton taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself henry fonda is powerlessthe fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated preprogrammed system that may not be stoppable simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task make nowin situation winnable the events in failsafe are fascinating because they are anything but predictable but the real reason failsafe works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot key ingredient the is its ability create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united states role in all of it most of this is through the films use of the character groeteschele walter matthau an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who incidentally is on the presidents advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging nuclear war many of the films most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices early in the he hosts dinner party where he explains the importance of strategy in nuclear assault minimize casualties what is the difference between million and million dead guest asks impatiently forty million groeteschele responds wryly the problem groetescheles mindset is that he believes nuclear combat be viable method of war the only difference him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over yet his answer the arms race is not slow down and try cool the situation off as general black dan oherlihy has often recommended on the contraryaccording groeteschele that would lead russia having more nuclear weapons than the s would clearly put america at disadvantage such stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race failsafe clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war and likewise it becomes central theme in the why continue build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them destroy the world several times over is it wise is it even logical no not really although failsafe is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism there is scene in the that deals communism in an intentionally superficial onesided sort of way again this is achieved through groeteschele who is easily the films most important character in terms of the largertheme significance in addition providing the central pronuclear war voice that the warns against he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone when it came communism the context the uses suggests that this hatred was often glib one of groetescheles logical trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it is merely absurd he labels the average marxist an unfeeling calculating machine that will do whatever it takes preserve itself groeteschele takes it so far as say that if the s drops the warhead on moscow the soviets will instantly surrender for retaliate would invite countermeasures that would further destroy russias home soilwhich must be preserved at all costs groeteschele seems forget these people are human beings emotions general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revengeas any normal person would the irony here is groetescheles own mechanical theorizing he is so quick judge the enemy that he does not even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns once the makes it evident that turning the s bombers will be impossible the question becomes what the consequences of destroying moscow will be just how will the soviet unions leader react and what can the president do convey his best intentions just how does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an mishap the help of his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates at length the soviet leader in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity lumets long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader without getting into too much detail will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances that is as sensible as nuclear incident can probably be it does accomplish what it must it avoids an allout war something that simply is not possible because of its alltooreal consequences dramatically the ending is quite powerful and the use of oherlihys character as the symbolic matador providing bookend the ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the films opening is particularly appropriate failsafe is production of major studio released columbia pictures and it has the structure of hightension suspense thriller that one might expect from nevertheless under lumets direction and walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation of burdicks and wheelers novel the continues have lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded the often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming but it was the conscious human choice initialize this automatic arming that failsafe also finds dangerous in retrospect the arms race seems be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century it is just fortunate that both sides were finally able come their senses and slow down rather than continuing groetescheles dangerous approach of speeding up and causing possible meltdown,1.0
andrew lloyd webbers musicals preferably his early work lyricist tim rice present musical is totally unlike any musical before its time webber and rice do not subscribe the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like funny thing happened on the way the forum they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics like jesus christ superstar examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from fame perspective in the cool tune superstar dead judas comes back from the dead ask jesus why he did not spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per eva who slept her way the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although think madonna did rise the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals the rise and fall of eva per a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share bit in common although it was not like di slept the top webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have point for doing it here they wish expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still good woman fairly good intentions and her death was very sad it is also musical almost no words not unsung the plays like rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also very entertaining one after all this is musical and webbers musicals never undermine this they are balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side this is why the beginning of evita is kind of letdown okay it is letdown am not saying the opening moments are bad because they are pretty good but what comes after is lifeless unentertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons singer jimmy nail into taking eva buenos aires after onenight stand in the musical it is fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires is also lifeless then punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall was meant for later character screwed over eva the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid present her for what she is even while it is being narrated hater of evas the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in negative light for while it looks like alan parker cannot pull it off however the pulls itself together in flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful from this point on the is hypnotic satisfying and satirical no more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact we see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise stardom falter bit come back and then gradually die of cancer think it was because of cancer more importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on this as well as some fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work juan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory muted scene where he tries visit her respective room but is shunned allows us learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before from the goodbye and thank you number on the shows eva trying cover up for the horrible government doing cheap and petty things wooed nation and saved government even while it left the nations people downtrodden but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was star that is when our narrator ch comes out show that she was not the great woman she really was and expose her fame describing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background he is said be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the but he serves as perspective on eva but even his perspective cannot help us from feeling bad when eva dies pathetic death alan parker no stranger bizarre musicals he is done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter is absolutely brilliant nails the exposing everything for what it is we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should the way it is presented his direction is manipulative for reason show the mourning for what it is and there is energy throughout lots of bright colors and scenes are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings do not cry for me argentina and her death sequence is poignant becuase of how sad it is madonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the at the beginning she looks like she is too busy concentrating on her singing act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late her death though is brilliant her singing could be better though know she took lessons improve her range and all but it still sounds like she is trying hard she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti lupone heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her but it is generally very good although not up the brilliance the role really requires antonio banderas who is almost like guilty pleasure these days am one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting lovable narrator his singing is very good though nothing compared the original mandy patinkin he does have pretty good singing voice and great range and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming put on poker face for his melancholy facade although it gets off rocky start rocky polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes wonderully poignant musical like the other musical released in woody allens everyone says love you it is reminder that the musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for brief performance,1.0

while watching wes andersons rushmore it may be surprising think that the role of max fischer the films antihero was not written jason schwartzman in mind the young actor making his debut as year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman schwartzman plays max student who is more interested in his extracurricular activities such as writing edgy plays like serpico and being president of the rushmore beekeepers but sees his grades suffer as result on the brink of being thrown out he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross olivia williams and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume the great bill murray build an aquarium on rushmores baseball field in her honour unfortunately for everyone involved blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well gets in the way of maxs plans woo her max is one of the bestwritten characters we have yet seen in the and schwartzman plays him perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given someone of his age as everyone else has probably already pointed out he is reminiscent of young dustin hoffman although was reminded more of paul from the wonder years from visual standpoint at least hopefully if he avoids typecasting as weird quirky lonertypes he should earn himself good career bill murray is his equal as blume displaying depth we have not yet seen from him while this is not his best performance that honour goes groundhog day he is still terrific here williams is not given much do except react schwartzman and murray but still does fine work rushmore seems go just little too long but while it is not perfect it is definate mustsee for anyone who wants see that rarity an american comingofage that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality anderson has created modern classic star who should any luck rise even greater success,1.0
no did not read the novel thomas hardy jude the obscure his final novel final because this created such an outrage that he never wrote again see did do some research on it about man who is plagued bad luck throughout his entire life but after watching the movie can imagine how incredibly depressing it is jude is satirical from start finish about societys way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but what is remarkable is how timeless this is the takes place in the late th century or early th was not really sure but its story could even be retold today in modern form although it would be kinda different given it tells the story of jude christopher eccleston the psychotic accountant from shallow grave simple dimwitted young man big dreams in its bleak foreboding opening shot in grainy black and white he gets lesson from phillotson liam cunningham his teacher as they stand upon mountain looking upon city in the distance he says all you have do is work hard and you can have anything in the world after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths because they frolicked in the hay literally but did not ultimately share anything in common he moves away town giant university chance learn more and get ahead in life taking welding job he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars reciting latin over and over again and training himself but when he sends his application for the school in he is bluntly told just remain worker another reason for going this town was because someone in his family lives there sue kate winslet his cousin and very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants be school teacher she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job for none other than phillotson at the local school there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business nudge nudge several twists turn in the storyline and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business an interesting scene say the least and are soon born into controversial nonwedlock as she eventually gives birth their baby and jude inherits his son from arabella who turns up again after awhile because they are not married and because they are cousins they run into problems every place they go carrying around two children everywhere and only staying in lodges for very brief period of time then moving on if you did not think this was harsh enough wait till you see what happens later on the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world he will never gain any true happiness and any happiness that happens him will be fleeting and will probably bring more horrible instances his life part of it is his fault he is too optimistic and too gullible but society has way of taking these people and hurting them until their death the ending of jude is bleak because it has be although hear the ending of the novel is even worse guess will have read it now jude offers satirical view on societys cruelties but shows no way of curing this and thank heavens it does not there is no way relinquish the selfishness of society and any solution would be too small cure such mass problem satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds and that is what jude is sure it is one hell of downer but it needs be the also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads and some good supporting work along it christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson his new look and dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing big dumb smile his face and making him kind of childlike at other times kate winslet in pre titanic performance is brilliant nailing every psyche of her character and creating someone who is troubled but very seductive her personality kate may be the best actress in her age group if you do not believe me see titanic branaghs hamlet sense and sensibility and heavenly creatures the latter one being my favorite performance of hers in the supporting roles liam cunningham is wonderfully flawed teacher exposing all his bad parts but ultimately being pretty good person and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as judes wife whom he never divorces jude moves at very slow pace and keeps taunting its viewers chances of happiness for its protagonists would drive some people nuts but those who appreciate good social commentary their films no matter how slow or downright depressing they are this one is both will appreciate jude though doubt anyone truly enjoys it,1.0

known as the most successful highestgrossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck gold pretty woman opened quietly during the summer of but thanks positive wordofmouth was able reach upwards of million in theaters alone the question of why it worked so well lies directly the films two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable the other winning element that makes pretty woman so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence is rarely as palpable in todays films as it is here edward lewis richard gere is suave extremely wealthy business mogul who at the start of the picture breaks up his girlfriend over the phone after nasty argument and abruptly takes his friends car and gets lost on boulevard while trying find his hotel stopping the car along the street he asks woman obviously prostitute for directions agreeing get in his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike up conversation and before long she has been asked up his penthouse room on the top floor this meeting does not lead sex however as edward confides that he would rather just have someone talk and offers her spend the night just as well since the hooker named vivian is beautiful generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned when edward finally offers pay vivian threethousand dollars if she will stay him for six days and nights while he is in the area keeping him company and acting as his companion business dinners and gettogethers since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything him except kiss him on the lips always leads unwanted intimacy when dealing her customers the obligatory rule of the genre says that the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss allegedly planned as grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director pretty woman has been transformed in all senses of the word into classic fairy tale la cinderella the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been you honestly do not need highiq or any iq for that matter guess how the will end and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and lessthangratifying and the screenplay is no award winner and yet amidst all of these qualms and flaws pretty woman is an astoundingly charming motion picture and it is definately easy see why it became such an overnight sensation moviegoers you would actually be amazed how far bemusement can go and there are few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are as romantic as anything have seen on in the additionally the belongs and its success can be attributed two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts playing sex symbols throughout the such pictures as american gigolo and an officer and gentleman gere branches out here play more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa julia roberts in her breakthrough role after wellreceived mistic pizza and steel magnolia for she was nominated for an academy award is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian who surprisingly could be role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line of work but more for her sheer intelligence it would have probably been easy have written vivian as merely flake but screenwriter f lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters do such thing after pretty woman roberts along meg ryan became the reigning queen of romantic comedies her latest being the justreleased runaway bride repairs gere and roberts together once again and no wonder roberts has continually proven not only be strong actress flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently do drama and in almost every she appears in it is difficult not fall in love her along her male costar an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his coworkers that vivian is actually prostitute and he then approaches her making sexual advances no only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing as more professional eloquent young lady but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such way and ultimately causes her question where exactly her life is leading and if she likes this particular path on the more dreamy side the is filled romantic scenes that are simply effervescent behold especially one in edward enters into the hotels lounge see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing kiss edward who is asleep and placing it on his lips since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached this man who may very well be out of her life forever in short couple of days pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene is happy ending as you would expect and would not have it any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances this one misstep does not put damper on the rest of the though because there is just far too much magic at work here disaffirm such petty problem helped along warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo as vivians best friend and roommate and fabulously catchy soundtrack in all of the songs prominently aid in the movies overall fulfillment pretty woman is sparkler of motion picture and has what it takes act as blueprint on how make the quintessential romantic comedy,1.0

this remake of la cage aux folles features gay couple pretending be straight in order pull the wool over the eyes of their sons future inlaws the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible williams owns nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as heterosexual abode williams is excellent as should be no surprise gene hackman as rightwing potential fatherinlaw is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles the real star is lane his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world the straightshooting uncle is hilarious perhaps it is personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this are filled it luckily for me at least it does not last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception the question of stereotypes is touchy one these guys personify the homophobic gay image you can almost hear the swishing if you think that they are supposed be representative of every gay man in the world you will be outraged but if you can accept the view is that this is movie about gay individuals you will love it your choice,1.0

the movie before it was even released never mind that there is so much going on in this movie in terms of plot action special effects and longterm story that analyze every aspect would take lot of time and energy and still would not cover everything and also like ted does in all of his reviews will try review this in way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if was talking directly you the reader before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered get the specifics of the skip this and the next four paragraphs as has been made obvious for the last several years another trilogy of films will be produced account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series the first of the films was actually episode four not one george lucas the creator of the series has probably just assumed most people know the firstproduced trilogy star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi is actually the second trilogy chronologically in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order but cannot recall his reasons this new he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy err second trilogy well you know what mean and in order for this review be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned unfortunately may serve as spoilers so proceed caution critics note it is one my personal policy not intentionally analyze spoilers because would like my reviews be able make sense the reader both before and after viewing the reviewed but it would be nearly impossible do the justice here without breaking the rule critics note reviewing this also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies as roger ebert coined it is not what movie is about but how it is about it because so many outside factors come into play in the films plot and significance as part of trilogy and just considering modern society it again would be difficult if not impossible simply review the as completely autonomous story first of all we have catalog what we know about the before even going into it we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker who will lead successful revolution against him and his empire we know obiwan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts become jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall the dark side we also know something about the force itself that it is some kind of universal force determines fate and can be manipulated those whose minds are expanded enough believe in it and feel it the jedi what we do not know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth me this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed be subtle definite order all the complexity also it seems that we are supposed be familiar few other details about the story have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended most notably details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that he was once senator and his last name is palpatine for those who have not kept up all the star wars paraphernalia over the years there is still way know these details simply recognizing an actor or his voice at least the phantom menace being the first chapter of long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid including the history behind all the major factors of the series especially the force and the jedi knights unfortunately this does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be history so long and detailed it could never be explained did not liked that aspect this and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness if you are going tell story from the beginning tell it from the beginning is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes through clarify the back story even further but digress have said so much and yet have not even touched on the specifics of the itself all these necessary disclaiming elements should go show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual itself what we get here is movie not unlike any of the other three we have come know and love since the late its similarity the other films helps keep the spirit of the series familiar but at the same time seems be flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality the basic story is rather sorted complex and even confusing at times we are told that an army known as the trade federation has set up blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo we are not given too many details clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is instead the opts get its story moving quickly we are introduced two jedi the master quigon jinn neeson and his apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planets queen amidala portman the leader of the federation an alien called viceroy is following the orders of strange mythical character an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed the black robe and hood he wears he is referred as lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice of his he is obviously one of the most significant characters in the series sidious communicates viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants keep secret because that would also reveal his identity is never openly revealed in the but should be clear most viewers have feeling we will delve into his background in the next two films but it does not take the long spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the films story begins move along the does not have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one miniplot and adventure on top of another there are so many of these miniplotswithinplots in this would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook the other films have relied on this type of storytelling but because of the limits of the technology at the time the films screenplays were also limiting the sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits as we already know the takes place at least generation or two before the original star wars trilogy means lot of the background was unclear andor unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of yearold anakin skywalker lloyd quigon jinn and his introduction the jedi council briefly summarize the story jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt buy parts for queen amidalas spaceship was damaged in efforts free her from the federation their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up the will of the force jinn can feel that skywalker has great natural power in the force and through another subplot involving bet on skywalker in fantastic race he will enter more and more details of his significance begin reveal themselves this also provides for new elaboration and explanation of the force has never been mentioned before in fact it seems be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific is completely unnecessary the films third act all the major significant elements become tied together in rather familiar execution of the plot it is funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology new agelike philosophy and religion and yet the solution all the major conflicts in the series has been violence not that this technique has not been used in movies and in reallife situations countless times throughout history and at least it is all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in fun and exciting matter it does border of the cartoonish sometimes but that is just the appealing our inner child is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such big part of our modern society the phantom menace delivers exactly what you would expect from star wars is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness so many things in the we have seen before and done more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just bit more on story and character because they were limited but this is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies,1.0
the story of us rob reiner is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in way they are rarely touched as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in year films well has two of them the other being the instant classic about very dysfunctional family american beauty the story of us about the highs and lows of marriage and family is well written heartbreaking and insightful that made the majority of the audience including myself cry the story of us tells the story of ben bruce willis and katie michelle pfeiffer jordan and asks the question can marriage survive years of marriage the is about two individuals who have come together spent good chunk of their lives together and shows when our main characters are him and her during the bad times and when they are us during the good times the story of us is about their entire years of marriage that is collapsing day day ben and katie now only see and live each other because they do not want devastate their children the fact that their parents no longer or at least say they do not love each other anymore ben cartoonist and katie crossword puzzle writer have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage as they have grown follow different views on life family and marriage katie is the more organized sophisticated type who wants plan everything out while ben is spontaneous adventurous individual who does not mind doing things differently than they were planned the story of us plays out nicely as the opens ben sharing his story therapist told the viewer through flashbacks as the progresses it switches between ben and katie talking their therapist their stories being told flashbacks of their marriage this method is highly effective as we see the characters changing from year year slowly growing apart through the flashbacks we get see the story of them through both of the characters eyes and this gives us strong sense of what their characters are really like as the story of us has three dimensional believable main characters the screenplay written jessie nelson stepmom and alan zweibel dragnet is touching down earth work that hits chord within the viewer much like another one of nelsons films stepmom the script has an open honesty and outlook on life one that is so realistic you feel uncomfortable at many times because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar as most families these days most go through the hard times as ben and katie must if it was not for the first minutes that the writers wrote are rugged and certainly flawed the story of us would have been this years best picture bruce willis usual actionadventure star has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being man who was being typecast the same role in action movies distinguished sophisticated actor as in last summers the sixth sense and now in the story of us willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed good script although would not pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan willis handles himself nicely and shines in few of the films most powerful scenes enough that make his performance definite contender comes awards season where start about michelle pfeiffer pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong as she brings her character life such charisma and emotion you wonder how how it is possible for someone portray real person such realism pfeiffers performance is one that if not recognized the academy next spring will be in the hearts of any viewer that has watched this moving the story of us is one of most real yet funny films as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears keep the viewer hooked superb acting direction writing story and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the is beautifully composed eric clapton and marc shaiman make the story of us touching unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall the films major high points are the fights between ben and katie as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed and although they also say things like it is over or hate you you can tell the two still share deep connection and that inside somewhere they are still an us the bottom line wonderful enchanting and heartbreaking one of the most realistic heartbreaking films in recent years,1.0
warren beatty returns the screens in the funniest craziest and hard hitting movie in his career based on story concocted himself and also written beatty bulworth gives good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system beatty stars as senator jay bulworth who is going through nervous breakdown after hiring someone kill him he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what is _really_ happening in american politics much the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy platt instead of everyone hating him the american public love him however inside his party more people want kill him than just the hired assassin and he also strikes relationship black girl nina berry it is remarkable that this was released at all much more open than the rather subdued primary colours bulworth barely gives the american politic system good name the outrageous remarks bulworth makes his potential voters are very funny and also somewhat true it is great that beatty is not afraid let loose on subject talking of beatty he is excellent in the role of the demented senator clearing having fun and seeing warren beatty have fun is rare sight indeed even in dick tracy he was the most straighten face actor then again he was the only characters face we could completely see the gives an opportunity for the year old beatty indulge in some rapping he does gusto and also quite well and seeing beatty as homeboy has be seen be believed it is nice see that beatty can laugh at himself second best is oliver platt as the flustered coke snorting assistant who goes over the top when he finally snaps halle berry is fine and sexy as the intellectual nina who comes like the senator also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit a strange accent laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she is also played and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife who all contribute the fun and this being political the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance as shock himself the writing and directing both beatty are above par the direction is very nearly sitcom like but suits the perfectly and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well the script is funny and the raps are actually well produced and humorous and quite clever they are not cringe inducing at least the script makes many points about society in america today and is not afraid make any bold statements about what is flawed system best of all the is thought provoking but directed and written in such way that the feels as light as feather and is very entertaining there is also great rap soundtrack some well chosen tunes bulworth is many advantages and few flaws perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing see year old man rapping but beatty does it so well it is irrelevant in fact there is very little against bulworth except for the language is very heavy but then again it should be expected bulworth then is well worth watching david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes,1.0

jack nicholson has funny way of playing characters very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway in as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall successful novelist obsessivecompulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact people around him as possible except when he feels like being royal pain in the youknowwhere he is mean mean really mean the opening scene shows him shoving little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium every day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served the same waitress you can tell that this is his favorite place be vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe one day melvin makes comment that goes far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like ton of bricks at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up him as matter of course but is also the only person who can get him too another person who often crosses melvins sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvins floor aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him prime target simons friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better when simon walks in on pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simons dog while he convalesces this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets like the dog and the two develop an attachment is the catalyst melvins softening up the world around him it does not happen overnight but throughout the he bites his tongue here cares little there and most miraculously falls in love one of the best elements of this is watching melvin try express feelings are not the usual negative ones he so often shares others he is traveling terra incognita here and it shows good performances are turned in all principal players in this especially nicholson and hunt they play well off of each other and have genuine chemistry makes it pleasure watch them on screen greg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon he gives short monologue about what it means for him be an artist and delivers it such inspiration and conviction that you actually get feel some of what he feels cuba gooding jr performs hypedup level of energy contrasts nicely that of kinnear and comes through near constant comic performance the screenplay mark andrus and james brooks is clever touching and funny the best part about it however is that it is filled characters we care about because they are actually interesting melvin is man we cannot quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention carol is working woman living her mother trying take care of child debilitating respiratory problem simon is man who is success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted much of society combined the talent of the actors these characters make the the one noticeable area where the is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half his character makes an exit is supposed be temporary but the ends before his return leaving his relationship simon and melvin unresolved would have liked have seen more of his character in general in addition part in the films conclusion there is one actor who will probably not be recognized any awards but who contributes greatly many of the movies best scenes and who deserves mention this is that little dog he plays such pivotal role melvins character development actually serves forward the plot and has some absolutely scenestealing moments that it is hard believe he is simply an animal award or no however when even the dog puts in good performance you know you have got an outstanding movie,1.0

plot lines the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in they were released it is also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go and it seems that using comedy as medium is proving worthwhile effort while it is very serious issue many it is the comedies that people are flocking see and that are gaining notoriety but the way we are using comedy present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh and when movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able thoroughly enjoy it does not poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it all it is comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aidsafflicted gay man in philadelphia if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave highly emotional tribute the gay community and even sighted former gay teacher of his as major inspiration in his life it is serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it screenwriter paul rudnick it is true that if this same had been written heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written an openly gay writer the prerogative was set kevin kline who only seems become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana after threeyear engagement fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for best actor oscar the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute his high school english teacher mr brackett everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and he is gay the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in simultaneous jaw drop the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such conservative american haven such as greenleaf naturally the questions pour from howards fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high schools principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand the frenzy is not helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants spend whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding the intrusion is all but welcome howard who is going more and more out of his mind each passing minute it seems that no matter where he turns camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed him like frisbees the dominoes begin tumble as howards closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it were not presented nearperfection one of this years most delightful ensemble casts kline seems only improve age and he is downright perfect here the great thing about this is that every single character has moment shine and they use it wonderfully every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when they are up bat rudnicks script is heavily laced wit and humor and you will likely find yourself laughing out loud for solid ninety minutes while in out does not carry enough give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year allaround the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and we are allowed just the perfect blend of hearttugging so as not bog down the laughs it remains solid comedy throughout its entirety yet we are still allowed sappily touching

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned on december amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream although the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years the shocked industry observers scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences finally presenting set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated the genre the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able reap similar fortunes the strategy of casting young tv stars draw the youth demographic was given boost scream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new lines nightmare on elm street series was thrust back into the limelight and screams rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the scene in stunning fashion it is hard understate this last point mr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream know what you did last summer from october and now scream enjoyed meteoric rise fame quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading box office figurewatching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as director indeed in singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional wes craven drapes the films title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution the project may be unprecedented can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of is attained and much like mr tarantinos screenwriting mr williamsons work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions other films into the dialogue of his characters in scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of sequels scream was written in during the infamous bob dole rampage against and mr williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that and this sequel while the sequel was planned from the outset treatment of scream was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and it is only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging like its predecessor scream opens splashy eyegrabbing prologue only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative this time around we are following the exploits of young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab running filmwithinafilm gag where the true life events behind the first has been turned into movie however although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the vaguely reminded me of the one was sharing the theatre and was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in horror that have ever seen there are too many knowing hip popculture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup is not nearly as cleverly frightening as screams while the first films preface dizzyingly built up final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical flash the campus of smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and escape the notoriety from the events in the first the murders open this result in reuniting the survivors singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town cover the breaking story while everawkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in protectively guard over sidney they are joined cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in cameo appearance during the first his role here is significantly expanded the incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although suppose good case can be made that it really is not necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all sequel slasher what do you think happened these characters in the prior movie there is lot of new faces on the scene too sidneys new boyfriend derek jerry oconnell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randys fellow student mickey timothy olyphant gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf coed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi any of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim as is seemingly becoming regular staple of kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of whodunit one problem that scream did not have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer here and some extent in know what you did last summer mr williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered trying turn the identity of the killer into mystery the occasionally becomes so bogged down misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements it does not help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo indeed the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth glazed eyes this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all get on it while the basic setup and premise for the is fairly contrived the aspect where it is headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences they are staged much more imaginatively here save for the first postprologue murder is handled in such mediocre conventional fashion that it seems be culled directly from the predictable slasher flicks that the first satirized and are much more fun watch it is hard hold back smile during giddy scene where sidney and her companion have climb over the incapacitated killer in order escape from car wreck and catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown in terms of its characters the strong part of the is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied his very own theme music their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten and there is curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed on the other hand sidney is pretty dull here she does not have any compelling presence and there is nothing particularly interesting about her this time around make us care about her other than that she is the returning heroine given this and the fact that there is no strong second banana character for sidney elise neals role is not nearly substantive enough adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes it is no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the what surprises me the most about scream is its zealousness in decimating its cast the films mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal applaud this bold policy at some point you have got be wondering about just how many characters will make it the next sequel was particularly surprised the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series would have seemed obvious but hey as rose mcgowans character said in the first no please do not kill me mr ghostface want be in the sequel look what that got her,1.0
note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned it is startling consider that it was only few years ago that distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut wide berth the lion king had just cracked million domestic in gross become one of the most profitable ventures in history continuing build on sturdy base left prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast since then though disneys animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and this years hercules successively proving less and less potent the once seeminglyimpregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced their first serious competition in the animated market from foxs anastasia disney has brought xmas home early dusting off the feature sparked the modern revival of feature animation the little mermaid while the animation for the is as is typically the case for disney films unquestionably topnotch the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music the films storyline is fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone his daughter teen disobeys father and goes desperate lengths win her man except in this case the chaperone is crab the teen is young mermaid and the object of her desire is human prince what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric she is resolutely smitten and she is such pure and endearing character that one cannot help but invest their heart her this simple but touching love story coupled healthy dose of smart humour makes the little mermaid remarkably captivating picture one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something now curiously dates it the voices cast for its motley crew of characters this was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue started certain degree beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated robin williams muchheralded turn in aladdin the release of the lion king and henceforth the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced celebrities while it is understandable that animated features lacking the namerecognition or drawing power of disney say baltos use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda or even anastasias showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack would be forced turn this strategy in order hype their products it is unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy do we really need hear say demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame is the films entertainment value really augmented hearing recognizable voice rather than voice best suits the role am not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan fortunately the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid although perhaps more obscure are impeccably cast chief among them is jodi benson tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you who voices the films heroine ariel perfection wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor and gorgeous singing voice ms benson provides most engaging anchor for the she is the only reason would even consider catching flubber similarly samuel wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian the weary guardian crab he easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all they are worth and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes under the sea and kiss the girl have become the stuff of legend pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father king triton in large roles and small edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal and rene auberjonois has great fun his exuberant french chef the little mermaid is impeccably cast of course the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed the songwriting team of alan menken music and howard ashman lyrics who had created little shop of horrors and would go on compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr ashmans untimely death not only are mr menkens tunes unbearably catchy but mr ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are virtual extension of the characters dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the mr menkens score for the is equally topnotch the sequence where eric voiced christopher daniel barnes and ariel tour his kingdom in horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous mr menkens fine score it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled under the sea as joyfully crooned mr wright won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song indeed one of the many little joys in screening the during its rerelease was listening children scattered throughout the audience singing along the tune but my favourite is ms bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad part of your world an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope wonderfully lyricized mr ashman accompanied the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence packs an emotional wallop literally brought tears my eyes during the songs reprise builds crescendo ariel arching on rock as wave crashes in the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history as of this writing november has come an end as has disneys limited day rerelease of the little mermaid there is no question that the primary motivation for if not the films reissue itself at least its timing was reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture anastasia in every respect the rerelease of the little mermaid appears be success the films grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic million mark the little mermaid proved have remarkably strong drawing power for initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video pulling in close million in its opening weekend and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot allowing for disneys odious flubber sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away but although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist the real winner is the public any reason put this back into theatres is good one and it is true joy see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen the little mermaid is the best come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance and one of the greatest animated films ever made,1.0

in intolerance w griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one the other each of the stories builds fastpaced climax in magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected the others yet the stories and where they are going are all independent what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized each story builds tense moment or what appears be intended be tense moment but then lets the tension dissolve while the tension dissipates one character starts singing song and in each plotline the major characters sing along even though they are not in the same scene then toward the end the stories each build tense moment again it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked this creates some strange effects the stories are about empty desperate people dysfunctional relationships the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content we have the story of dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting get in touch his son and make amends phil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic help partridge achieve his final goal partridges young wife linda julianne moore is getting

hall hosts popular childrens tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman and former quiz kid donnie smith william macy the juggles all these stories for over three hours but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily each story moves toward single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems do much but derail each story the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails really tie up any of the stories the seems be built around strange events and weird history but it really has little do the content of the stories though they all are connected in part one weird event magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous films hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories it is interesting that one starts look forward actors from andersons company john reilly seems be standard fixture particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight here he several of the characters are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used as studies of characters these stories are each worth following as wellrounded stories beginning middle and end they leave something be desired but the is willing do the unexpected and that helps make the worth sitting through rate it on the scale and low on the scale heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler during the strange climactic event of the we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen and in actual fact it does since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods it is however perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon the cause is associated whirlwinds we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are when the whirlwind is over water animals near the surface frequently fish and frogs may suffer the same fate essentially they are vacuumed up the whirlwind held aloft updrafts and finally dropped elsewhere so while the rain is possible some doubts do creep in the rain of frogs depicted in this may be of greater scale than had pictured for rain of frogs it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles have this sort of phenomenon frankly have no idea on these points otherwise the event was quite believable what we see in this is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano in the it is left ambiguous if the rain is sign from god since there are many references exodus and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants however rain of frogs though it feels biblical is most definitely not biblical portent

contact is the movie have seen the most five times be exact four of those times were on the big screen but even on tv it is very impressive the same cannot be said for films like independance day but that is because contact is rare example in scifi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id did not offer much outside of some onetime delightful eye candy contacts wonderfully presented story deals ellie arroway jodie foster radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of merely listening sounds out in space her interest in the field of astronomy developed at very young age encouraged her loving father ted david morse who let ellie use small ham radio pick up on frequencies and communicate people as far away as pensacola fl that was of course before the days of internet chat rooms while everyone else uses modern technologies aid them in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence of the program seti is an acronym for ellie prefers pop on pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive ellies strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist belief likely influenced the death of her father while she was still quite young in puerto rico she meets palmer joss matthew mcconaughey writer examining the effects of technology on the worlds overall happiness one time seminary student who describes himself as man of the cloth without the cloth despite the vast differences in opinion regarding supreme being ellie and palmer hit it off and even take the time sleep together it is weak and hurried relationship but director zemeckis needs it add the plot later on meanwhile dr david drumlin tom skerritt who has authority over seti but finds the program frivolous waste of time and money is ready pull the plug on any and all seti funding this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors eventually finding setup in new mexico and leaving palmer no explanation and only one night stand remember it is in this nm city where several months later ellie finally picks up on strong signal from outer space perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science when the signal is closely examined many new developments spring up and before long drumlin is stepping in take over the operation he once scoffed at eventually it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for transportation device used teleport an earthling vega where the signal seems have originated the media swarms fanatics go further off the deep end scientists clamor for new information politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions take and presidents are morphed into celluloid reality remember when zemeckis could not get enough of this in forrest gump as if that were not enough ellies discovery leads her the nations capital where she again runs into palmer contact is based on the novel carl sagan and deals heavily the subject of science vs religion the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented no signs of bias arguments for both sides are intelligent solid and thoughtprovoking when palmer joins selection committee choose an ambassador vega of ellie is leading candidate personal convictions play more important role than love interests the question is can person who does not believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when of the planet does believe in higher power even when the wraps up it is uncertain whether it is meant play as an advocate for religion science both or even neither and in our modern day society where right and wrong is only opinion at least speaking politically correctly the ambiguity is an incentive do not get me wrong as much as it sounds like it contact is not merely theology class rolled into reel of it is highly enjoyable two and half hours despite its seemingly heavy issues it is not tedious undertaking watch this the special effects are outstanding though warning highly depreciated on the small screen even so some of the subtle visual effects that will likely go unnoticed many are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as scifi the storytelling is rich and complete and although there are moments in the that feel quite pretentious and at times even hokey it is easily one of the best films and one of the best scifi films have ever seen this is zemeckis best since back the future and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated zemeckis now has real reason boast,1.0
roberto benigni is clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton this italian star best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther has done the near impossible creating comic fable about the holocaust but benignis life is beautiful la vita bella is not so much story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as backdrop tell story of familial love devotion and sacrifice the movie starts out as typical slapstick farce benignis guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in fulfill his dream of owning bookstore like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him most notably the almostforgotten harry langdon benignis guido has childlike innocence he ignores the growing antisemitism of the fascist government instead guido ardently falls in love and persues dora local school teacher who already is engaged local fascist official in benignis tightly wound script this is the same fascist official whom guido had an earlier unfortunate yet slapstick encounter guido wins dora they marry fast forward about five years guido dora and their yearold son giosue giorgio cantarini are happy family guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening bookstore but racial and antisemitic tensions are on the rise in italy and guido has determined do his best shield his son from these harsh realities the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported concentration camp here guido must use all his skill and imagination not only shield his son but keep him from being exterminated it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend offend those whom the holocaust has touched for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror the pain the unimaginable suffering of schindlers list true many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over and most were not sent the death camps but work camps where they were used as slave labor unlike steven spielberg benigni is not out tell the story of the holocaust his story is about family and the lengths parent will go protect child for guido save his son transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game giosue must follow the rules without question amass points the winner takes home tank therefore guido tells him he must remain hidden in the barracks he cannot make sound nor allow the guards see him guido explains this during hilarious sequence when german guard barks the camp instructions the newly arrived inmates guido lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners instead lays down the rules for his son allow him chance survive throughout their imprisonment guidos quick thinking continually keeps his son from harms way ultimately the allies rescue the camp in poignant scene giosue comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound the boy goes wideeyed wonderment and delight thinking he has won the game the price for his victory is most high benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history prove that even in hell ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness life is beautiful is fantasy fable it is not be taken as record of the holocaust those who object it are missing its point and that is simply where there is hope where there is life and where there is love the spark of humanity will never be extinguished committed lifelong learning through effective communication,1.0

virtual reality is topic that has almost defined its own genre since dark city films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix all the films released after it have been less successful david cronenbergs existenz released only couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated some but the hype was gone and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall it was completely overseen and ignored admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again it was therefore was less than excited when went out see the thirteenth floor however was positively surprised josef rusnaks latest picture matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best of hollywoods action and effects an intelligent story existenz was violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending in blood and madness the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between instead of going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix or aiming at the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents more intelligent plot witch will provide less entertaining and more serious experience that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding in near future on the thirteenth floor of classified building genius scientist hannon fuller has created simulated world his personal dreamworld where every inhabitant is complex selflearning program that only believes it is real right after the first testing of this world fuller is found murdered douglas hall his closest friend and business partner immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth beautiful woman gretchen mol who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key the mystery might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence the first download into simulation is impressive it is the creators first visit his world his creation in order enter this virtual universe you have take over someones identity become another person this is called conciseness transfer and this is part of the tragedy in the people wake up in unknown places and strange things start happen they start doubt in their own sanity these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their users and creators their sanity and their lives it is frightening reality the fact that all the people in the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets in someones fantasy an appealing blade runner type of detective story this presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present our modern world is metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal the thirties are different colorful beautiful elegant virile this contrast demonstrates wish for change virtual reality is here portrayed as magical enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities some it is just journey their personal paradise some personal playground life without any consequences for others way start over and correct their mistakes living in an illusion of their past virtual reality is wizard that transforms your hopes dreams and fantasies life at least that is how it is all beginning but when you are waking up from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning your personal paradise this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what is real what is thought who are we if these were answered this would be the greatest science fiction ever made they are off course not answered but posed in an intelligent manner the visual aspect of the is one of the key elements since it portrays the contrast between these computersimulated universes kirk petrucelli has done marvelous job the recreation of the thirties its glamour grace and color and setting this world in opposition our own an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties there are some honest and decent performances an almost unknown cast and harald kloses moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time rather unusual thing aboutthe thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects there are no cgi animated creatures no bullets in slow motion this is more philosophical approach reminding about the european way of filmmaking this is off course major disappointment the audience that is used endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark cityfans will be pleased this is interesting and inspiring it has everything existenz does not but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix and then there is happy end like in dark city completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics including blade runner and dark city this in mind the thirteenth floor does not make an oscar candidate or that will be remembered year from now yet this is beautiful elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality,1.0
i do not know what movie the critics saw but it was not this one the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring in my personal opinion they could not be more wrong if you were expecting airplane like laughs and agatha christieintense mystery then yes this movie would be disappointment however if you are just looking for an enjoyable movie and good time this is one see honest it is this story is about th network wbn taking americas airwaves in penny henderson mary stuart masterson the station owners secretary must deal her overbearing boss an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready quite on moments notice partly due the fact that they have not been paid in weeks among the mayhem she must also deal her soontobe exhusband roger brian benben who desperately wants her back unfortunately her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation while trying woo penny back roger must deal the police and try find the killer that lurks at wbn mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny am trying be unbiased so will not tell you how amazing she looked although brian benben gets most of the screen time along the two leads are several recognizable faces including corbin bernsen a law michael mckean laverne shirley and bobcat goldthwait the special effects are amazing and fooled me some may argue is not very difficult do in many scenes although the movie sometimes goes overboard the physical comedy it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie overall gave it or an depending on what system you use some comments collected from friends,1.0

stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in single production one would immediately identify the as potential academy award hot shot sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart typical thriller helen weaver after traumatic near death encounter serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed phobia for being outdoors so speak incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers make her juicy target for serial killer wannabes year has passed and strange deaths begin terrorise the city of san francisco detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled the unorthodox methods of killing used the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first copycat borrows lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work but copycat tries be little bit more immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem disrupt the mood of the entire and also much of the time wasted could have been used build up the suspense and injected drama even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments weaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona harry connick jr very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer la hannibal lecter comes the moment of judgement drum roll please copycat is good thriller although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move this worked pretty well and will offer audiences couple of unexpected jolts nice movie bring your girlfriend,1.0
no it is not bad in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose actually wished for the end itself quickly event horizon is not your runofthemill scifi am sure many who have watched this will agree me it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner the magic of this lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical buildup that makes it wonderfully horrifying the story brings us the year where space travel have since enormously progressed the event horizon is actually ship built for secret experimental purpose it has the ability fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in mans lifetime the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune search and rescue team led miller fishburne is given the task check for survivors of the event horizon the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened his otherwise technologically impressive ship event horizon is scifi horror much truer the word than say alien would ever be while in alien the crew has cope ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where really felt like saying out loud enough cannot stand this anymore there are more than enough jolts send your adrenalin pumping overtime the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average most commercial standards even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this thanks its wellpaced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences incidentally has been quite generously removed our censorship board director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror this picture did not do very well in the us boxoffice most probably for the dreadfactor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend watch this although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for massentertainment many thrills spills and suspense keep audiences in focus however the offbeat horror element it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing my friend and could not say word each other for quite while after going through the experience of event horizon guess it was just the immense feeling of dread the had cast upon us be forewarned this is not for the fainthearted nor for pure entertainment be prepared be disturbed if you should decide watch this event horizon is highly recommended but at your own risk it has been long time since goodhorror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one,1.0
capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for and ultimately refreshing story of black man on the run from the cops the first few minutes of sweet sweetbacks baad asssss song yes checked that is the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up several loving mothersurrogate figures then one of them takes the boy bed for sexual initation underneath the title credits that is far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something we are not used seeing on screen this is one tough movie swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences the plot is simple but not simpleminded sweetback hassled two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse beat up on black man breaks his bonds and runs like hell along the way he moves through good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto in other lesser movies sweetback would be machinegunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over pile of bodies in this one we get taken on kind of tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted ssbas first appeared in and was promptly rated an allwhite jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and it is hardly surprising why there is good deal of sex in the movie but it is handled in way that is unsettlingly frank frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie in one scene sweetback visits friends house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet we are not used coming this close people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out be glamorous the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands one scene in man is interrogated the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through cleverly edited soundtrack another note ssbas is not so much antiwhite that would be too easy as antiauthority and as the movie goes on demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of ones own mind ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use little more of that in our movie diet god knows,1.0
a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july did not really expect very much when rented stuart saves his family the movie bombed at the box office and had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on the movie was based my real concern though was the general reputation of snlrelated movies translating the big screen lessthanstellar results halfbaked anyone was surprised discover truly entertaining often hilarious yet also touching little it is an al franken production throughandthrough who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture for those of you who do not know al franken plays guy named stuart smalley who has really annoying show on publicaccess station about increasing your selfesteem etc although not licensed therapist stuart smalley is as the program proudly boasts graduate of several step programs stuart is doing well enough his tv show but he keeps getting distracted family troubles stuarts relatives are mess his dad and brother harris yulin and vincent donofrio respectively are alcoholics his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce and his mom is in constant selfdenial and solves all perceived problems baking then disaster strikes stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked he is forced move back in his family after he can no longer support himself and there the comedy truly picks up franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes but as sharplydrawn real people although smalleys dad has always imbibed too much stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy also after an accident towards the end of the movie both stuart and the audience learn that there is more his mother than previously thought although filled small very funny scenes stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments especially towards the conclusion for lightweight comedy it handles these scenes especially well often better than many socalled serious dramas of today all the more amazing is that such movie comes from saturday night live sketch that is essentially onejoke bit if you feel like renting comedy and you have not seen this definitely recommend you try this one out you will laugh you will cry it is all there,1.0

no filmmaker deconstructs story as well as atom egoyan am referring specifically the narrative form in the sweet hereafter egoyan tells his story in similar framework his exotica or the adjuster said story of fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent british columbia that shatters the morale of the locals is told in most unstraightforward manner when the opens the accident has already happened and stephens the wonderful holm polite ambulancechaser has arrived the promise of lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning throughout we get meet the parents of the dead broken souls who follow stephens like the pied piper passages of are read during the but there is one living passenger the paralyzed nicole polley whose dark secrets of life before the accident may affect her decision testify we finally do see the accident about three quarters into the is stunning visual effect horrific long take that shows the bus sliding then stopping then collapsing into frozen lake is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and perhaps ever in motion picture the fractured narrative also intercuts preoccupied stephens on an airplane traveling meet his hivpositive runaway daughter as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led preaccident have problem not the story or story structure but egoyans heavy handedness behind the camera for the first hour or so can quite honestly say was on the verge of tears these are miserable miserable people but that is just the problem so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after while when lot of sadness becomes too much also subplot involving incest rings untrue perhaps it would not feel so contrived if it were not shot in such tasteful manner there are two characters who are father and daughter when they first appeared thought they were lovers was halfright nevertheless it is worthseeing the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that american films are about action canadian films are about consequences hence recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors including crash and kissed the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films simply because it is not boring or in the case of kissed afraid of its own material necrophilia egoyan is fine fine postmodern storyteller whose work is entertaining edgy and smart if bit too intellectual at times though harped on the weightiness of the material was always absorbed engrossed and surprised the sweet hereafter,1.0
i know what would do million if found it in previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if were jacob and lou huh well in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in he and his dimwitted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon large bag of cash inside plane wreck against his better judgement hank decides go along the idea of keeping it rather than going the authorities the rest of the is question of who is going die keep this secret and is it worth it simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle oh and its much better than any of those sam raimi took departure from his normal freakshow horrormonkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer do think raimi knew he had winner on his hands and decided direct the picture on natural flowing course one of the films components can be linked recurring theme in terrence malicks the thin red line in malicks three hour boreathon he makes an interesting attempt link mother earth his war story it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut field of flowing grass small bird or flowing body of water sure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty his efforts raimi does fine job of tying in fox in chicken coop and birds of prey signify the future of the characters think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is very intriguing ingredient in the and then there is billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent industry is vital the life blood of if it can continute produce people like thorton will be ok he gives fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so jacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or did not know how say or if he was just taking long time think about the thing he just said here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry though the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has very appealing new twist in its characters paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group far cry from chet in wierd science perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advicegiving wife but she certainly does not do anything ruin the picture simple plan can be included in the group of recent small films that is just dark and pretty unredeeming but at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts,1.0
i saw simon birch in basically sold out theater on sunday afternoon when the movie was over and the audience was exiting did not hear one negative comment and did not have any offer simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys simon ian michael smith and joe joseph mazzello and what destiny holds for both of them simon is dwarf who was not supposed last through the night after birth due weak heart surprisingly he does and now constantly reminds everyone that he is living miracle simon thinks god has plan for him purpose for his life and his condition he just does not know what joe is an illegitimate child referred both comically and dramatically throughout the as bastard who is mom ashley judd will not tell him who his father is simon has more than just dwarfism as problem the people in the town do not really like him because he is not natural even his own parents do not care about him and are disappointed they did not have normal son he is also harassed in church the local pastor rev russell david strathairn and simons chain smoking sunday school teacher played jan hooks the only person other than joe that really cares for simon is joes mom who he also looks up as mother it would be just simons luck that he would accidentally kills joes mom something you are told at the beginning of the movie joe now motherless as well as fatherless feels the need find out who his real father is the help of ben oliver platt the local drama teacher and joes moms current boyfriend before her death he will attempt locate his dad and get in little trouble on the way most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny although not all of it is simon will also look for gods plan for him although he loses little faith along the way starring in the first and last five minutes of the is hollywoods newest dramatic actor jim carrey jim plays the adult version of joe and does impressive job starting the off and then tying it up just right this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway and he does commendable job simon birch is written and directed mark steven johnson this is his first as director but he has written several films including the grumpy old men series he does an outstanding writing and directing job here the films structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly the dialog goes from extremely funny morose without missing beat the cast is excellent joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance joseph is outstanding for someone of any age not alone someone who just turned ian michael smith in his debut has such strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation other great performances are turned in the rest of the supporting cast loved this movie it is far and away one of the best films have seen all year take your whole family see simon birch it is magnificent an american masterpiece,1.0
the saint was actually little better than expected it be in some ways in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes living stealing things from others for others this movie closely resembles james bond flick it has the classic bond symbols man who can do just about anything and get away it woman whom the man persues villain out achieve something for himself who kills anyone reach this goal kilmer actually provides rather good role in this movie although at times you are left ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations the movie begins in his childhood in strict school run catholic priests as young boy kilmers character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork that is until his school teacher finds him reading book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name that of catholic saint he refuses do so and instead announces who he wishes be this leads devestating mistake is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life kilmers first mission that we are shown is steal microchip from ivan tretiak played rade serbedzija during press conference he must make his way into heavily guarded vault area avoiding guards cameras and many other potential obstacles once his mission is completed and he is safely home the fee is paid when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only few million dollars short of million he decides carry out only one more mission then retire dr emma russell portrayed elisabeth shue has discovered way produce energy way of cold fusion this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia where millions are without heat and are freezing death the only problem is tretiak would like have this for himself and use it gain power amongst the people this presents the option for kilmer achieve his goal tretiak hires him steal the equations small pieces of paper from shue one of the enjoyable features in the is the disguises that kilmer dawns complete his missions they are very convincing not only the characters in the movie but us kilmer utilizes one such disguise lure shues character into getting know him even more would provide him means of stealing the energy formula when the two meet and end up having sensual experience kilmers character is seemingly falling in love emma russell as she is falling in love kilmers alterego traveling artist yet he must reach his goal of million requires him steal the energy formula putting his feelings aside shues character is eventually able track down simon templar putting the pieces the names of the catholic saints together something no one else is able do when she finds him they are left team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak the saint is very actionpacked few slow points the sound was very well done and added the many intense moments along the course of the movie there are even few although brief moments of comedy these moments are almost always thanks kilmers extraneous very convincing disguises and personalities all in all rather enjoyable movie nearly nonstop action,1.0
the thirteenth floor the third in what would call the reality check movie series is very similar the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz all three made you think made you wonder what is real what is not and if our world is just huge game the thirteenth floor does not reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives great shot at it in the matrix we were told that the humans are simply virus in existenz we learned that our life could be just game in the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices there is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated the thirteenth floor took huge risky turn that did not expect it take and am not very sure it was such great turn make rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the the thirteenth floor becomes murder mystery that ends up tying in the different worlds after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played armin muellerstahl douglas hall played craig bierko man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using the year consists of computer generated characters only the simulation of is just like it was back in the olden days all of the people involved are just characters or are they douglas strongly believes that character traveled through the transport from their world ours and killed fuller along the way douglas interacts many different potential suspects and woman who claims be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully talented young actress gretchen mol the thirteenth floor is plot driven movie from the time the gets going and does not use spectacular special effects and big sound keep the viewers interests was worried that this would be too much like the matrix and existenz and would not enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns keep me thinking and attentive the unfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened the scenes that are not original or interesting seem go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this sometimes it was hard believe that this story terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true know this is not true story or anything but should be able make you think that it is on the plus side of acting we get see the missing from main character action since the masterpiece shine in actor armin muellerstahl in the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances another plus is gretchen mols realistic performance creating her character depth not just staying in the onedimensional phase do not expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another that messes your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would thrills chills and spills are not what you will get in this but you will just get another trip send your mind on scrambling it until you have had enough the bottom line let us hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile,1.0

i have never been member of the robin williams fan club little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes long way and sometimes feel as though am watching yearold class clown in his films williams has often tried balance his mania touchyfeely emotion leading wildly uneven performances mrs doubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems but instead it proves be williams best comic screen project yet while it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence mrs doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up high energy williams stars as daniel hillard cartoon voiceover artist penchant for irresponsible behavior one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda sally field and she files for divorce unemployed living in disastrously unkempt apartment and faced limited time his three beloved children daniel decides respond mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper he turns his brother frank harvey fierstein theatrical makeup artist and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire matronly yearold englishwoman daniel uses his access the house keep an eye on mirandas flirtation wealthy client pierce brosnan spend time the children and learn something about responsible parenting all the while trying keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best mrs doubtfire has overcome mountain of implausibilities work and basically it does so the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel and thanks the fantastic special makeup that is instantly believable it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle more problematic was series of calls daniel makes miranda posing as nannies from hell it is bit hard swallow that she does not recognize any of the voices as her husbands perhaps the biggest contrivance we are asked swallow is that daniel could make quick change into mrs doubtfire in few minutes there is more realistic makeup than slapping on latex mask fortunately these are inconsistencies only attract attention as the credits roll during the was generally too busy laughing after getting off slow start involving too much of williams riffing mrs doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place daniels frantic attempt fool court officer is wonderful as is the climactic restaurant sequence even though saw the resolutions coming mile away clearly most of the credit for doubtfires success goes robin williams it took putting him in drag but for once he plays comic character that is not just robin williams different name he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire and seems relish the scenes in he gets play her as blunt and foulmouthed wisely he never aims for saintly his responses the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty but the kind of thing most of us might do the benefit of anonymity it is one of mrs doubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect just people trying be better as miranda sally field is solid in background role and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu the children are also good although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams do his thing it is easy see mrs doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over and it is true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common but mrs doubtfire manages carve out its own space particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship there is nothing dazzlingly new in mrs doubtfire but there are plenty of laughs and good comedies are always in short supply and it is nice see robin williams just act for change,1.0

i must admit am going be bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how met my current girlfriend the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity am not big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me this maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity con air and pushing tin but maybe it was because feel as giddy as school kid right now this whole romantic thing currently in my life the story of serendipity is simple two people john trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale looking ever so hot have chance encounter over pair of gloves buck henry smack dab in the middle charmed beyond repair these two knuckleheads grab sundae together at caf called serendipity talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down and spend few hours at the local ice skating rink but each of them already involved other parties sara has john write his name and number on bill and she writes her name and number on copy of love in the time of cholera sara declares that if this thing let us just call it love is destined happen fate will bring them together in the future years later and on opposite coasts of america john and sara both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates decide seek each other out rest their doubts what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious catandmouse game the fates involving such items as mistaken identity graduate homage john corbett as freaky new age musician and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman find out if that thing was right after all fortunately firsttime screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong wellrounded characters propel predictable and corny narrative coupled deft directing michael chelsom director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones and the use of timelapse camera work illustrate the passage of years the comes off genuine believability and sincerity both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on the flipside films such as you have got mail made in heaven and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the films main journey at hand but it is what happens the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture,1.0
in some regards making movie is like trying stretch rubber band as far as you can without breaking it try too hard and it snaps but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how master the technique he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie few bold steps in the end he is not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went direct such fine feature there is no doubt about it the that johnson has crafted is rich he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown maine leaves turn bright orange in the fall the grass is lush green pure white snow falls in the winter and the sky goes on forever the characters continue that turn our two leads are simon birch ian michael smith and joe wenteworth joseph mazzello simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital and age twelve he is only two feet tall joe is the bastard son of rebecca ashley judd and age twelve he is ready know who is father is naturally the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together from disrupting sunday school doing community service playing little league baseball in wonderfully executed performance ian michael smith simon birch is convinced that he is gods instrument and there must be reason he is so small joe does not quite buy it but he sticks simon the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each others only true friends early on the two meet up ben goodrich oliver platt rebeccas new boyfriend and although the bond is not immediate ben and the two boys develop liking for each other both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters deep likeability the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon testament the acting jobs of both finally jim carrey gives cameo as the adult joe in the present day and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show mark steven johnsons sense of drama and writing is fantastic the script is loosely based on john irvings novel prayer for owen meany but it is so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on suggested along those same lines it is almost unfitting compare the two johnson uses tension humor atmosphere and suspense create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions no means has he developed project of similar popularity gump made over million dollars while birch ought pass out of sight in few weeks but the winning idea remains the same simon birch is different look at different life and one that will most likely be studied in school classes in decades come in the present however it is an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought take look at,1.0
on the basis of this alone never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the countrys biggest hotshot director reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf heres what the two movies do have in common scenes of intelligent amusing dialogue no relevance the plot story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced swear words and racialgender slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it is only got one story tell rather than three crime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other pull diamond store heist the five are instructed not reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated instead they are all given code names off the color chart mr white keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantinos chin most of the movies running time is spent mr white and pink waiting at warehouse for the others arrive mr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from gunshot wound the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading white believe one of the five was an informant the storys background unfolds through series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior the crime eventually blonde arrives police officer hostage and what follows is truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene let us just say picasso would be inspired what blonde does the cops ear lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heistgonewrong movie but there are few sequences that are uniquely tarantino the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on high note the rest of it does not live up as the criminals plus joe have conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonnas like virgin another scene involves roths lengthy manufactured story about running into group of cops and police dog in bus station bathroom while carrying giant bag of marijuana neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time develop like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie reservoir dogs is good but it is no pulp fiction,1.0
it is fact that good thriller or action movie does not need violence be good or worth watching all it takes is potential violence make the audience bite their nails and what kind of violence could be more efficient than global thermonuclear war and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon computer whizkid david is usually contended hacking into the school computer change his grades but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants be the first play it instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes the frontgate of norad the help of jennifer girl in his biology class he starts play nice game of nuclear war wopr war operation plan response topnotch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer remember being and watching this at the cinema it was very efficent at giving you scare in those days and that has not changed of course nuclear war seemed be much more of something that could actually happen back in would not be surprised if this gave people nightmares hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains mystery but the rest of the actors are no fault of their own restricted the script play onedimensional grownups davids parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the movies like secret admirer porkys or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove if for no other reason you should see this movie enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on far from any modem my guess is that it is some kind of bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum the big computer at norad has lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sfmovie but it is hardly impressing compared what you can get today what are the lessons we can learn from wargames make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers thank you whoever it was for giving us graphical user interface when we use our computers,1.0
there exists litany of differences between successful action movie and successful suspense movie action movies are typically devoid of plot other than simple byline can string together several explosive sequences while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability bring everything fullcircle for fans of both genres however realism is key action fans want know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic and suspense fans want everything fall into an explainable framework the movies end on this advice director john frankenheimer the island of dr moreau strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller ronin the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing considering the fare that is fallen into the same category over the last few years the script written d zeik in his bigscreen debut approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission impossible two years ago certain number of people will be lost this but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times frankenheimer masters the script poise and tells us dark but stoically realistic tale of group of postcold war mercenaries working earn their paycheck his ability convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here and ronin becomes better movie because of it robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time he takes command and offers much gravity as the exspy sam man who is called france help shady operations controller named dierdre natascha mcelhone recover package the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast especially once the requisite doublecrossing begins and its role is skillfully penned zeik at times however zeiks tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission impossible de niro might easily become tom cruise the package might become cruises computer disk fortunately the focus here is almost entirely on the package whereas in mission the script was more concerned the doublecross and why it happened the action content is impressive and it lives up the hints given in previews the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect fullblown combat scenes and instead are forced suffer through moments of slowness ronin does take degree of intelligence follow all of the nuance from start finish but even the uninitiated will be able keep grasp on most characters mand subplots the suspense tapers off considerably the end bit of drawback because of its height at the movies open considering these factors it is good see that ronin was project that turned out well and it is another good bet this month since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months it is definitely worth the visit,1.0

damn those trailers had it not been for the advertising of this reveals far too much about its contents would have been glued under the sand as it is the retains some value thanks an excellent performance charlotte rampling and more mature francois ozon in the directors chair marie charlotte rampling and her husband jean bruno cremer lounge on the beach she takes nap while he goes for swim when marie wakes up jean is nowhere be found she contacts authorities but they cannot find him either did he disappear start new life was he killed accident did he commit suicide marie still asks herself these questions year later and in order move on her life she must find some answers it is fine premise and this little movie uses it the limit the moves at leisurely pace bit slow but relaxing it is very visual story and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles this is mostly thanks the excellent camera work antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie who shot the in dreamy haze and the lead performance rampling rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie you connect her character instantly despite that she is delusional the scenes where she interacts her husband who she still believes is alive are heartbreaking she cannot quite get over him they have been married for twentyfive years the other actors particularly jacques nolot are excellent too the sex in the is rather unneeded but compared ozons criminal lovers it is the disney channel likely cause some discussion afterwards under the sand is fine movie going experience while it is hard recommend as entertainment it is fine adult alternative about how we deal loss ozon seems ask what you would do and that is certainly hard question answer,1.0
