the beach is structurally confusing that can only describe has having multiple personality disorder every forty minutes of this twohour begins new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act it starts off purposefully as about an innocent man seeking new thrills in dangerous environment but then in the second act the mood of the abruptly changes and it becomes story about love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of blue lagoon forty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining sense of bliss at all costs the time it is over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this was really meant be about the main character of the beach is angstridden richard leonardo dicaprio he travels the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you are looking for good time richards voiceover tells the audience that he has come this place because he is bored his life and feels that one way reinvigorate himself is let go of the familiar and enter into world of the unknown this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for he checks into fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle he seems like raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted some sort of psychosis though his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens him as he speaks of mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen moreover the island itself flourishes enough hemp plants that can make small city high for life captivated the idea he asks two other hotel guests join him on his journey they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come thailand for reasons similar richards once they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts richards growing desire for francoise this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up richard etienne is about as exciting as fluffy white sand it is odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has way of hiding potential threats just out of view and once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers for example there are marijuana fields close patrolled armed guards and the lagoon in they swim invites the occasional shark there are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own featurelength there is the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopiagoneawry angle but the meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred dicaprio as result has an almost impossible time of trying embody the different states of mind that he and the goes through consequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying keep up,0.0

in the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of abovethetitle stars patrick swayze demi moore and whoopi goldberg eight years later moore and goldbergs careers are not exactly thriving but they have had their share of screen successes since the same cannot be said of swayze who has just added yet another turkey his resume the aptly named black dog forget the mortal kombat moviesthis trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come video games good truck driver jack crews swayze must drive cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta new jersey along the way jack and his crew of three run into number of obstaclessuch as highway weigh station evil truckers and deadly uzifiring motorcyclists every so often like at the end of video game level or stage the main baddie pops up red meat loaf fresh from the triumph of spice world who wants steal the cache of guns just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who is driving what all of reds vehicles be it pickup or big rig are paintedyou guessed itred could go into more of the plot specifics such as jacks dream of having nice home his family the past trauma that sent him prison and cost him his trucking license the fbiatf crew tracking the cargo but they are of little importance all that matters director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point point but they fail at even this modest goal for none of the highway chaos as credibly staged as it is is terribly interesting let alone exciting once you have seen couple of trucks bang against each other or big rig explode the first time you have seen it every time as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment the saddest part about the has nothing do what shows up onscreen it is that swayze has reduce himself such work while far from the best of actors he is certainly not horrible and he is charismatic presence do not know if it is his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him involve himself bombs such as black dog regardless if he continues on this career track could tv series be far behind,0.0
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows most of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hacks of the present do the memories of their past but some five or six years ago there were not that many movies and the trend did not look that depressing so the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular animated series about modern stone age family were not particularly worried when the word came about live action remake after all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good the plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of middle class america fred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie odonnell adopt baby return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test fred and based on that fred gets wellpaid job in management but of course this is just sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme in the meantime freds wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who cannot stand fred on the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series life computer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show unfortunately problems this start inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used be much skinnier than rosie odonnell but the greatest problem of all is plot or be precise the lack of plot some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the is lame original characters onedimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and interoffice politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this result is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal disease known as high concept after great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned the animated version all in all is not that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it,0.0
after falling down hoped that joel schumacher would mature into great director since then he has offered us two soso adaptations of john grisham novels the client and time kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumachers potential the publicity for his latest release mm raised new hope it promised be something unusual it was not the plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is private eye who is hired wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter investigate an mm movie found among her late husbands belongings the movie appears be snuff in teenage girl is raped and murdered man in leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumachers batman robin because murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom discover if the girl is alive or dead combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girls name and tracks her los angeles the aid of max california joaquin phoenix video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff the plot bears an obvious resemblance paul schraders hardcore in father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex find his missing daughter both films are modeled on dantes the inferno of course mm makes that connection overly obvious casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward meeting the devil hardcore is much more subtle and meaningful mm had lot of promise in its better moments it is an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even nice guy like tom one moment of the first sort when we first meet max he is reading truman capotes in cold blood underneath the cover of porn novel in cold blood was the father of the truecrime genre is the literary equivalent of snuff films max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance the devil and the devil do not change the devil changes you tom does changei will let you discover the specifics for yourselfbut not permanently schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker did not have the guts take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he could not come back walkers seven did much better job on that theme refusing compromise cage tries hard pull it off but the script does not give him enough work phoenix walks away the moviehe is smart charming and funny other cast members include fargo peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos james gandolfini as soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far in the last analysis since mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond chandlerross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege however unlike other predictable fare in the genrelast years twilight for example mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is,0.0

i can imagine how good krippendorfs tribe must have looked on paper it does not surprise me in the least that group of extremely talented actors led the great richard dreyfuss and good director todd holland all wanted make this in fact it is only the expertise this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorfs tribe as possible in retrospect can imagine how bad this could have been shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss dreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted his university find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea halfway into his twoyear expedition his wife apparently dies say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established later we find out that much of the grant money was spent on bigscreen tvs and other such pleasures so when krippendorf finds out what happens professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides construct an elaborate lie he makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in video he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe he calls the shelmickedmu audiences at krippendorfs lectures are amazed his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision and proof that the typical family unit is led single father is truly amazing the anthropological community like all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated us wondering at what point it is all going fall out from under our hero dreyfuss is funny talented man and he is funny in this he has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages play people like this realistically this also requires lot of physical humor that have never seen dreyfuss perform and he does great job jenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work is also very funny and appealing here and the kid actors are great as well but we are talking about the script from hell this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome dreyfuss and crew no the script is plagued so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that was in disbelief as watched furthermore the manor in all of this material is covered up is truly shameless take for instance the scene in krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex they get all decked out in the tribe getup complete paint darken their skin krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe now saw this scene coming from mile away but said myself no that would be far too tasteless there is no way they will do that oh god they did do it it is there was almost more appalled the fact that this did not bother the other audience members whom saw this found it deplorable and when krippendorf is forced admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice the is filled scenes like these they not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the portrays it would take some truly professional work create videos convincing enough fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon and watching dreyfuss stumble over completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able see that he is making everything up as he goes if were an anthropologist this would insult me immensely moving right along the plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes sure dreyfuss dressing up like chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as the themes and thoughts that it provokes it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that was able watch this his character here is not good subject for because he is shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does suppose it was interesting see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste would have expected something no this man sets terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the charlie peters did not include single scene in krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad in fact it is his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings suppose it is important admit that this is funny dreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up picture that is anything but boring and if you are less serious than you probably will enjoy it however cannot get past these elements krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as family comedy but this is the kind of that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they should not be learning little more insight into its story and themes this could have been good movie,0.0

americas sweethearts has an intriguing premise and great cast but it is not nearly as edgy or funny as it should be almost all the problems the project can be traced back coscript writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting comic relief charity shows robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of selfindulgence crystal ignores simple but crucial rule for screwball comedy work the characters must be placed into rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous americas sweethearts takes place at press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters it is promising setup but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation the end of the all the lead performers participate in huge fight room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed

ferreted straight back the hotel the next day writers go the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews every minutes or so producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for few minutes of questions publicist hovering in the corner keep an eye on things the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes question they may not be invited future junkets representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions they get roughly five minutes interview each member of the cast and crew the studio filming the exchanges the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up the stars but play it safe the studios stand ready erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs placing two spoiled actors in setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel plush resort near las vegas for most of the the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press when they do deal journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is declawed gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in restaurant filled the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected the goes nuts all without any repercussions lee certainly is not bothered any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior be delivered the tabloids is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors hell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie all of underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in americas sweethearts is based on barelyincontrol people trying contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it does not matter because any publicity is good publicity and thus the very setup for the implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter so what about the cast julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse show her in fat suit and not very convincing one the way catherine zetajones makes believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough make him vaguely sympathetic casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast broad gestures and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad seth green is amusing as toadie stanley tucci is very good as ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director suitable flair though he has little work come think of it little work is the operative phrase for this movie as satire americas sweethearts is toothless as romance it is at best minor pleasure such good cast such waste of their efforts had it not been taken long ago better title for the would have been much ado about nothing,0.0
do the folks at disney have no common decency they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects embarrassing writing and kidfriendly slapstick was not mr magoo enough people obviously not inspector gadget is not what would call ideal family entertainment younger viewers will likely be taken in the abounding goofiness but their adult companions may feel wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt endure this appalling minute exercise in glaring stupidity the movie is poorly edited grossly manipulative and the finished product resembles somewhat of failed jigsaw puzzle all the elements are there but the manner in director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite as huge fan of the animated tv show the first thing must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain in the cartoon dr claw was frightening raspyvoiced presence who remained total mystery the viewer we never saw his face he simply sat back in his armchair watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat as child always imagined what dr claw would appear as and this curiosity kept me watching for many years the release of the liveaction movie the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed it is rupert everett only now dr claw is simply known as claw one word he explains like madonna he sports shiny clamp instead of the steel glove and seems far less interesting than the animated version it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic but he overplays the role entirely too far when all is said and done this was not very wise move on the part of the screenwriters the infamous dr claw has been turned into wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool he does still have his cat though in the title role matthew broderick looks lost the actor while usually downright charming does not know exactly where take his character fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers broderick first plays friendly naive security guard named john brown who dreams of becoming cop and upholding the law for the good of the people he has mad crush on pretty scientist brenda joely fisher who has stumbled upon new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics but one fateful night her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen fiendish millionaire everett who wants take over the world john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames in full body cast he is chosen be the first human prototype for brendas work revolutionary crime fighting tool numerous fancy gadgets dispatch bad guys and so is born inspector gadget as bad as this movie is it does have certain charm in isolated scenes broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city and there are about two or three amusing punch lines the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates rampaging monster shadow puppets on brick wall and japanese man flees the scene while screaming this is why left tokyo alas the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about in favor of not even cracking slight giggle there are so many tired plot additions gadgets talking car voiced l hughley is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian both are wisecracking nonhuman additions designed coax laughter from smaller children well it just does not work in fact zoot functioned marvelously in comparison this and do not even get me started about the villains did not mind everetts performance but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe disgust the characters from the cartoon have been reduced thankless supporting roles penny michelle trachtenberg and brain the dog now have little do the action and chief quimby dabney coleman has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation live action the special effects are everywhere but not so annoying they will cause your eyes peel over the problem here lies solely in the script perhaps the next time disney attempts remake like this they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancyschmancy visuals here is one critic crossing his fingers anyway,0.0
if you have not plunked down your hardearned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on starbucks frappacino or on ben jerrys sundae these treats are great relief from the summer heat in contrast this made me simmer in disappointment can accept the fact that summer movies tend put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take back seat this was true of star wars episode but at least in that the story and the characters were still in the back seat in this they are no where be found what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like cancan dancers and clunky foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles mechanical tarantula two men are asked stop this threat one is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises best his opponents among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest the other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shootfirstthenshootsomemore method of investigating although their individual talents must be combined achieve success their interaction one another merely seemed like second rate twoman vaudevillian act for example there is scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled water rather than buckwheat is what it is currently filled now touch my breast west says gordon does so and then softly coos his approval found myself groaning at this kind of silliness the script fails generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter did enjoy klines reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave smith could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he is not even required act it was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and action heres an example in this scene will smith is about be hanged group of angry white people he must endear himself the crowd escape the director yells will smith do your own thing and action in another scene he has masquerade as belly dancer in order save his comrades will smith do your own thing and action worse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is horrid mess there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look there is actually lot of imagination at work in this there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat and that is too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this might have been palatable as it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year,0.0

starring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is disappointment and big one at that junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito director ivan reitman these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins so foolish me was hoping for something that would at least come close the level of quality of twins so much for hopes schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy unfortunately due circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding still believing that their drug will work they decide test it anyway on hesse so dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug their theory is that if the drug can prevent man from miscarrying surely it will work on woman does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous you well it must have the producers of junior admittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent pull it off perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny but it was not schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny schwarzenegger comes very close embarrassing himself these antics kept thinking myself the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture better yet schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why did not they make sequel twins anything would have been better than this mess danny devito is wasted in this movie his part could have been played any joker they pulled in off the street after seeing the movie if was devito probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street emma thompson is wasted here as well while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also fine comedian too bad she did not get use any of that talent here am being too hard on this do not think so schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have be trying hard make bad they certainly managed here maybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is movie that never should have been made if you are tempted see this do yourself favor and go rent twins that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devitos comedic talents,0.0

soldier director paul anderson is in any presence of originality is fleeting the best moments of the are in the opning scenes where kurt russels character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it little then it goes nowhere that idea there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the is just some of the biggest action movie cliches have ever seen the whole idea of the inhuman soldiertype character gaining some degree of humanity defending potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out kill her is done and it is been done much better was able predict the plot of the _whole_ story would not be so bad if other aspect of the somewhat interesting between the action sequences it tries deal the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the and the tiny little window his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited his performance in that way is not all that bad but certainly is not enough carry this other performances in this are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters but enough of this stuff about plot and character right is not the most important part of an action well the action even in this aspect the is disappointment in mortal kombat director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in can override problems plot and produce something entertaining however he fails repeat that in this the combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve fighting and combat scenes are supposed bring about thrills in this type of movie point even an otherwise unimpressive like starship troopers seemed realize but instead of reaching for something truly interesting end the it goes for the old shootem up one guy vs an army type of cinema that thought died the military action films of the if the went some of the ideas it opened up the introduction more seriously it could have been rather engaging science fiction however it utterly failed go in any new directions after that making the big disappointment,0.0
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for secret mission he attempts pop couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses after they ricochet off his face he says not good start as it turns out this line not only gives foreshadowing the opening sequence but the rest of the movie as well in this the latest of the jackie chan movies be released in america after first runs in hong kong chan plays an international operative codenamed condor and is tasked the united nations finding stash of gold hidden at secret base the nazis during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war for some reason condor is given his mission at the s embassy in spain think this may have been done so that in chase scene they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over fruit cart watch for it in any chase scene set in foreign country most notably in europe the chase will take itself through marketplace and fruit cart will be overturned it is almost guarantee anyway condor is given key is supposed unlock giant vault in the gold is hidden the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it may mean booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how use the key correctly condor is accompanied desert expert carol cheng and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold eva cobo there are not supposed be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain but condor finds the granddaughter looking her up in the phone book or something although these two women are supposed be integral parts of the mission they prove no help at all except get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan jump into his martial arts in fact most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just way set up fight suppose this is not so bad since chans action is really the best part of the movie and the only reason you go see one of his films anyway if you have never seen jackie chan movie do not expect great plot but do expect be entertained his moves they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human knowing that he does his own stunts and knowing that this is the real stuff no computermasked bungee cords here makes the action sequences all the more exciting you have got hand it guy who is probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art also of note in this as in any jackie chan movie is the humor as far as know none of his films take themselves too seriously and even the dramatic parts have certain tongueincheek quality about them what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes unlike martial arts such as anything jean claude van damme where the fights get you on the visceral level fight scenes in chans movies are simply entertaining you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such way make you laugh unfortunately even chans mastery cannot save this the plot and characters are so weak that they do not hold the movie together at all and the acting is terrible carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past but since operation condor is dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off this combined an obviously low production value made we want turn away from the screen until heard those kicks start flying,0.0
cashing in on the success of white men cannot jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles including the cowboy way and drop zone wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed hoping that they can strike up the same success sadly if this dismal cliche ridden and mindnumbingly boring action pic is anything go they have not got chance in hell of even coming close this time out the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops following several runins their tyrannical boss robert blake who is obsessed the money train train carries all the subways takingsand will let nothing stop it now there is an original plot device harrelsons character decides try and take off the cash along the way both of them fall in love the same womananother transit cop who also hates her boss this leads the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in of this standard you were always the better brother etc etc etc and does not help add anything the given better script better performers in supporting roles and shorter running time the almost went for two hoursor did it just feel like it this might and mean might have turned out okay but as it is it is stocked the worst action cliches whose only purpose appears be pad the out its painfully long running time robert blake who plays the evil boss has got be the most pathetic bad guy in history he sounds like wayne newton and appears think the best way appear evil is have your eyes bulging as though they are about burst out of their sockets but this is only one of money trains problems if you look at the script as if it was an action it lacks originality and suspense but if you try look at it as if it were heist it is even worse the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely as not butch and sundance the is not all bad though snipes and harrelson when they are not using the dumb cliches that the script gives them make an agreeable duo and some of the stuntwork is indeed excellent but good stuntwork cannot save bottomofthebarrel action movie if you are really undemanding action freak there is chance you will like this but if you are looking for something original or suspenseful try somewhere elsei doubt you will find it here,0.0
girl is in word mess was never able determine what spike lee was trying accomplish this there was no sense of where the was going or any kind of coherent narrative if there was point the missed it girl the way is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace all the girls are known their numbers the plot such as it is theresa randle is struggling y actress and eventually takes job as phonesex operator she begins lose contact reality as her job consumes her also she must deal the advances of her exhusband isiah washington he is an ex con thief and she tries keep him away while at the same time it is clear that she still harbors feelings for him her neighbor jimmy spike lee functions as the observer mediating between the ex husband and girl he also functions as point of stability as he watches her become seduced the lurid world of phone sex the soundtrack consisting of songs prince was jarring it kept taking my attention from the not altogether bad thing will grant you as what was transpiring onscreen was not that riveting for parts of the middle of the the music stayed blissfully in the background in the opening sequence and one scene later in the however the music was particularly loud and distracting of course have never really cared for princes or tafkap if you like music prince fans might love the soundtrack but it will probably be distracting even diehard fans of the performances the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character jimmy he was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl he should have stuck acting in this there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he would like be oliver stone when he grows up there are scenes shot different types of are purposely grainy and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers in that they worked propel the narrative in this they just made me more confused there are some amusing moments and few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become other than that though nothing much happens there are few intense moments as when one caller becomes frightening but even that is rather lackluster am not the biggest fan of spike lee though would agree that he has done some very good work in the past in girl though he seems be floundering he had an interesting idea fairly good setup and seemed wander aimlessly from there girl earns grade of,0.0
back in chuck norris used be synonym for the action films he could not of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shootem up and beatem up genre aficionados that quantity was mostly provided cannon group prolific production company that dominated the bmovie market in previous decade flooding it cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products the hitman action thriller directed chucks brother aaron is one of the last among them chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead his partner should not surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters surviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians since it is rather absurd expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this should have been action well the action in this falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films we know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed more human dimension in the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade during the somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing the black boy who gets adopted norris that caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had be quashed another subplot this one dealing lady lawyer who sleeps the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation the photography in this is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of style cinema leaves viewers without any reason justify the hour and half spent in watching it,0.0
as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times but alas professor brainard somehow manages accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber it is amazing that he is able remember any of the processes he uses make anything the whole point here is how could man be so blatantly forgetful this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is professor well this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin settle into what might truly be considered absent minded along the way becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience the flubber is supposed be flying rubber but it seems have life of its own this is there strictly for the kids the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone the poor professor has save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well the original the absent minded professor the whole scene the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable the basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage bounce fly and dribble their way back being close winning this just sounds too bad be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close the original movie give this chance as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie giving life the flubber is so poorly executed that it is best forgotten and prof brainards flying robot weebo giving life the flubber would have worked beautifully if it was not for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than put in bit of music and extend the length of the movie the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it was not and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good now weebo is totally different story it is robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of life too this is really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters the lacks the emotional punch pull the audience in at all the acting robin williams prof brainard seems be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age people when stood up at the altar do not usually give third chances or for that matter talk the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is childrens movie flubber as movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect the best character in the movie being something of prop doubt that many people will find it all that great it does have its amusing moments and it is good story in the end but it does not wash up the original kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they will probably enjoy the whole movie as movie it is just kids movie and not the best of ones at that,0.0
how do you judge that is so bad but intentionally so in spiceworld the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal mocking themselves purposely cheezy and having lot of fun doing it if that was their goal they did fantastic job so is it fair give it such low grade when it was not really meant be much better than this honestly would rather see this before many others gave higher grades so does that mean graded it inaccurately truth be known do not really think can answer this question understand spiceworld you have understand the spice girls unless you are very very young or fairly older you probably have at least heard of them they are group of five busty british babes who have had hit singles and whose debut album sold millions they are primarily adored preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices real name geri haliwell wonderbra all five of the girls have these spicy names for they are better known than their real names there is the aforementioned ginger spice as well as sporty spice melanie chisholm or mel scary spice melanie brown or mel baby spice emma bunton and posh spice victoria addams and all of them some degree or another resemble their stage names the spice girls took the world storm and spiceworld is actually good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise fame it is quite nice see what good sports the girls are and not just the one dubbed sporty about poking fun at themselves they do not take themselves too seriously and that is probably the best thing about them it is also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera acting and not just singing and dancing they are not flawless any means but for the most part they deliver their lines without feeling staged and like them or not we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters seems reasonable since they portray themselves what makes the bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls will not get enough of their music while the rest of us do not get enough of movie the real point of this is look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes most of the is very blas but several parts are downright boring and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud if you are big fan of the group you probably will not get enough of what you want and if you are not big fan you get too much time devoted nothing more than look at us moments for the right crowd the music video sequences will be the highlights of the but for others they will serve as threeminute lulls in hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline other key actors include richard grant as clifford the spice girls manager alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts make documentary of the group george wendt as martin barnfield producer who constantly works on pitching spice girls movie and roger moore in small selfparodizing role all provide relatively good performances keeping in mind once again that this was not meant be acted seriously even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems have fun it while this is continuously compared the beatles hard days night think that is an unjust comparison it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison way of press kits but do not think drector bob spiers nor the spice girls intended it be so think the studios were just trying boost hype and interest in the and have instead come off rather pretentious do not think this is trying be anything more than fun satirical look at group that got so big movie seemed the next likely step and what could have been better than selfindulged yet self mocking approach probably nothing and so it is spiceworld is movie thought would be embarrassing enjoy but now instead find myself wanting defend movie did not even give good review it is bad but it succeeds in every way it intended it gives the spice girls chance play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there indulge in every brainless moment perhaps the group is nothing more than gimmick if that is the case the movies gimmick is that it is such gimmick you might be saying spice girls movie come on but when it comes down it think that is the point,0.0
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffers character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts an that is fair enough all movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt the chance succeed after all we like think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders mountains can be moved and good movies can be made yeah right children fail as do films as does director john boormans latest the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ed wood true romance as the busty westernerinperil wandering about burma without passport though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there it is tougher task overlook the actress she is lightweight as the first scene narration demonstrates she does not have nearly enough range for the emotions that her charactera mother fleeing the memories of murdered husband and sonis supposed show she may give stronger performance than say keanu reeves in walk in the clouds not much beyond rangoon is very physically appealing thanks the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman deliverance excalibur hope and glory he keeps the narrative moving no matter how muddy the storyor the heroinegets why he chose arquette remains mystery though maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies but even after an hour of halfstated political statements and murky mass killings we still do not know enough of what is happening in this country feel distressed for the characters or their situations empty exoticism the technical credits in beyond rangoon are curious mix combining lush jungle photography bad bluescreen work also odd is the obvious dubbing done make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign and is it my mistake or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers doo doo doo doo twilight zone theme or opinion of movie you be the judge,0.0

is atrocious the special effects are mediocre the action is dull the implausibilities are legion the dialogue is cringeinducing the whole package is funny when it wants be serious and irritating when it wants be funny do not even want continue reviewing this movie would like purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is the premise is basically ripoff of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo the year is the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved only handful of humans escaped radiationrich areas escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear one man johnny goodboy know know tyler barry pepper ventures the outworld and is captured the psychlos there he confronts the psychlo head of security big ugly klingonlooking creature called terl john travolta pressed into slavery johnny vows lead revolution and take the planet back meanwhile terl is faced his own problems he has recently learned that he is stuck living on earth he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss sleeping the big mans daughter he decides give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous so the mananimal can lead mining expedition into places the psychlos cannot go terl then plans keep the mined gold for himself of course his plan does not work so many things wrong this movie where begin how about travolta whose clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru ron hubbards scifi novel early previews for battlefield earth constant shots of makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking the movie did nothing stem such remarks all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary the psychlos are probably supposed be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally do not laugh maniacally after denying pay raises their employees you were going be promoted but now you are not fwahahahahahahahaha it is no big surprise terl loses the humans he is an idiot he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book he underestimates his enemies assuming he will win just because he is smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra not content go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans the hero he hooks him up machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me he then appears shocked that johnny points gun at him no wonder this guy never got his promotion the plot inconsistencies are too numerous mention why do the psychlos build an earth base in both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses survive how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in hangar for years and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn fly them so quickly there is whole lot more scratch ones head about in battlefield earth bring scorecard track the plot holes director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason all the characters appear be standing on the walls and it is awfully difficult watch movie when you must tilt your head just watch ordinary passages of dialogue the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement are these things really so hard construct my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot this movie is an absolute headache it is not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense for most of battlefield earths running time just did not know what was happening it did not have anything do me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are really had no idea what the hell was going on when pieced the plot together later it did not look any better heres how much of disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and it is going take something really really inept top it the only thing we can take comfort in about the is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it in fact would think that hubbards cult would want distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible thatll teach me give into bad movie syndrome again,0.0

well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you because thats all that there really is found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot for one thing white leading actor who has black daughter does leave some curiosity am not saying that this is not possible but it does leave one wonder know did another thing is that this movie has sections are painfully stretched out and certain scenes are repeated essentially but slight variations there was one scene that should have been short but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it found myself thinking ok enough already get on it there are also times where you have wonder why things happen the way they do things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort another thing that noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning this movie is also very predictable you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at given moment granted this is hard omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you also some of the things that happen are little too predictable and several cliques are repeated it gets boring at times tell you the truth even though there is still action going on another little point might add is that the main character is supposed be quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero some of the characters are not proper for their roles the acting is fine but the characters just do not seem add up if was base my review totally on the plot then would not rate this movie too highly but that is just the thing this movie is not just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really movie the special effects are just amazing you cannot tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just would not be able say that the creature was not there during filming extinct or not another thing is the destruction scenes wow those were masterpieces well some of them were they were well choreographed and along the dinos make this one of the reasons see this movie this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments go see it in matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock think that some people really want money badly and think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have chance you know any movie that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made thought would put this here deflate the movie hype about this flick its not that bad movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this,0.0
when is produced on shoestring budget couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of genuine tragedy the easy path for reviewer who hated the movie is give it pass toss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was sit through and find some meaningless way compliment it this of course will be of no service your readers but at least you will avoid the hate mail from the movies fans thus it is heavy heart that review the movie paulina not be confused the recent movie paulie about talking parrot directed vicky funari as labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on the movie blends documentary footage historic and fanciful recreations relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez paulina was maid in vickys household when vicky was young got learn the films background when attended screening in the two women who made it were present for those without such context the reaction the may be that it is parody of bad indie the acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of bad home movie grainy and overexposed the movie shot on mm and videotape has little recommend it confusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story quite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed shock and repulse us why else would you include scene completely nude and bloody yearold paulina another scene has teenage paulina being fondled on bus the man sitting next her in retaliation she bites off part of his finger this covers the both of them in bucket of blood the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint sinner one for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out large heart that she had just cut from body the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten certainly she had endure miserable life but that does not guarantee that movie about her will necessarily being good felt trapped in the theater watching it only the opportunity talk the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable paulina runs the is in spanish english subtitles it is not rated but would be an for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers,0.0

in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first socalled supermodel and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had overcome in my eyes anyway just do not see how the life of model is worthy of two hour despite this kept an open mind when began watching the movie sadly though my fears were realized it is just not possible make an interesting fulllength about person who spends their days wearing different clothes the movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name tumultuous woman who does not particularly enjoy the world of fashion she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on woman she cannot have the last hour of the is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing job and going into rehab this formula is repeated several times and really got tired of it in general tend dislike movies featuring heavy drug use no because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me quite frankly do not see the appeal so when director shows me pointofview shot of junkie complete tipsy camera angles and echoing voices am left somewhat unimpressed the first hour of the though was actually quite engaging we see gia as she is discovered and moves new york her boyfriend these early scenes were interesting we are shown the fashion world through newcomers eyes and it was perspective had not seen before the movie begins go downhill however once gia becomes an established model from that point lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end it all seemed so excessive fine so gia had drug problem does this really need dominate the could not the same effect have been had five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting drugs or perhaps this is meant be warning aspiring models not get into the drug world quite possibly although since have no desire become model this warning is lost on me as stated at the beginning of this review simply do not see how the life of model is worthy of featurelength motion picture what do they do that warrants movie strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life gia did not and the end of the all knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bisexual and was heavily into drugs not exactly meaningful contribution society as far as am concerned,0.0

the following review encompasses two versions of dune dune the theatrical version runtime minutes capsule review cut down just over two hours nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible those unfamiliar the book the films visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative dune the extended version runtime minutes capsule review bit of throwtogether assembled mca tv special projects for cable television it was disowned director david lynch but it is considerably closer his original vision virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline quality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web the review released in and made on then mammoth budget of million the of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited scifi fans director david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico the screenplay was lynchs own chosen after the script submitted original author herbert was rejected dune is set in universe ruled powerful families overseen successive line of emperors the key cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that is home giant sandworms and the precious spice melange the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it most importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade flourish lynchs necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands one is the longstanding rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited the natives of arrakis the fremen the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that man would come from the outer worlds and lead them freedom unfortunately this epic story unfolds in confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the runs minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended the thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office lynchs initial cut running at closer three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made what great idea why not trim down an already complex so as make it almost incomprehensible the most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us badly underdeveloped characters thus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of pauls father duke leto their demise rather meaningless the end result is distinct chill we cannot warm most of the cast and we do not care much for them and it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook those unfamiliar the book dune is also very serous the constant selftalk various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not wince embarrassment the overall impression is world full of people so intense that no one is allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them humour or at least gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad sadistic kind is hard find you may balk at the comparison but as writer lynch could well have done some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy the theatrical version is still some way from being complete disaster however it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention sustain the interest of viewers taste for imaginative scifi special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight both the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original and the magnificent score toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the is at least feast for the senses see it in the widescreen format if you can and despite all the cuts several cast members still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order who is secret aim is manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends as paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as credible leader of the fremen crusade the conclusion any assessment of this must take into account that frank herberts original novel is complex piece of work and presents tough challenge for any filmmaker david lynch took brave stab at it and partly due forces beyond his control ended up an officially released version that fails in several key respects dune certainly confused and frustrated lot of people on its release many chose stay away altogether as the films disastrous box office showing attests the extended version however is rather different beast in lynch stated his intention release his own special edition directors cut of the on home video clear indication of his dissatisfaction the version that ended up in the theatres but alas he failed do so choosing move on other projects in way then it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa stung into action lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild take his name off the credits and replace it allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish disown their own work he also had the screenwriting credit changed the anonymous judas booth certainly looking at the results of mcas handiwork there is at least half dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director object but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of fill many holes in the original versions storyline pauls relationship his father and associates is more intimate moments of humour and warmth lacking previously the political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained pauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably and as further background new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills give us brief history of the dune universe as piece of storytelling then mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior as piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate there is some sloppy cutting too and in few instances shots even appear out of order and the use of repeated footage fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly outofcontext this is the kind of thing lynch objected and rightly so it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted satisfy the censorship demands of s television but the most notable omission is gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that was not even in herberts book the scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen pulling out his heart plug its surreal and disturbing episode that is very lynchesque but adds nothing what we already know the baron is nasty piece of work despite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is generally superior all up it contains minutes of restored footage and approximately another minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences unless the idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest we will get what the movie should have been on repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared admit still as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels some fans and perhaps the late

in many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed the rise of fascism was not so hard expect because the social turmoil of and economic decline of seemed be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies in such times when political involvement could be associated noble passion many filmmakers tried warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany of course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons for them moral depravity of fascism could be explained the audience explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn salon kitty his is very losely based on the novel peter nordern book that deals bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww in walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened be bugged the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel did not know the real purpose of that enterprise screenplay tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names schellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants use the brothel in order blackmail his way the top kitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has second job as cabaret singer caught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel there she falls in love customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged she informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide confront wallenberg those who tend bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation but although salon kitty does not happen be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between powerhungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised kitty unfortunately brass seems overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino viscontis the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulins unsuccessful attempt imitate lisa minellis musical numbers from cabaret all in all salon kitty is failure although some very interesting moments,0.0
dr dolittle th century fox running time hour minutes starring eddie murphy directed betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor murphy returns in this abysmal comedy he plays doctor john dolittle who as child had the ability understand animals however after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward see dolittle in crummy job surrounding crummy people most notably dr mark weller played oliver platt however bonk on the head his ability understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting happen except comedy never does happen doctor dolittle even the excellent premise rarely manages raise laugh poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers the manic murphy we saw in the is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears be getting all the work in the the voices of the animals include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie sadly most of their lines are pretty dumb and they are not funny dumb like dumb dumber but just boring dumb the even succumbs fart jokes halfway through in desperate attempt raise some laughs there are few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between if had choose favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has certain charm about him sadly he is barely in the movie and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time joke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor the director betty thomas has well done better films she bought us private parts and the brady bunch movie were sadly much better than this the scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done the animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets there is an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good you would have no problem guessing that most of the close ups are puppets however their jilted movement was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done better job doctor dolittle in the end is disappointment for everyone involved murphy has done much better movies e trading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures are not that good the target audience aged between who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks it is dumbed down humour everyone else however should give doctor dolittle miss,0.0
the generals daughter is heartless absurd movie so hopelessly dedicated its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish hamhanded obscenity creating that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth what is worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching dark conclusion in sudden rain storm john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell brenner is teamed up exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods soon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down why and of course who eberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined the story perhaps should have issued spoiler alert before mentioning that but it is painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the is hiding something on story level the generals daughter is ineptly constructed the adapted christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel was apparently based on true story plods along its conclusion filling in the blanks stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments having not read the novel it is difficult determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but suppose they all are guilty some degree scene after scene stumbles pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue includes endless strings of forced lines sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed would have answered if knew then the movie would already be over only after we have spent twenty minutes or so these characters do we learn that they have sordid history together this angle though apparently present develop their characters is never explored not that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than drive the plot in one scene sunderland is attacked man in mask she sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring instead of questioning him like as they would real suspect they take him brenners houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap this scene really pushed me over the edge not because it is gratuitous and meanspirited but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience it was impossible for me feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as surprise realized that these constructs on screen are not actually characters but devices present only serve the story this would have been bad enough without the wests need hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct compelling films about sexual crimes do not spend lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly do not show as much skin and sweat as typical pornographic picture these scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary they are intended simply provide the audience the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out be in addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if it is perversion of everything we know be pure this standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment welldeveloped themes back it up as it is the forgets that lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on pair of handcuffs does not make person insane perhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are couple of the performances james woods has few terrific scenes and plays his role sharp witty subtlety also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west make him villainous nonetheless these performances are undermined entirely the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization the generals daughter is the worst kind of it pretends have soul be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments,0.0

a few months before the release of star wars episode the phantom menace th century fox decides release another space that is complete rip off of star wars what is the point of this do not know but wish it had not been done considering wing commander is definitely the years worst so far attract people this horrible movie they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace wing commander will draw large crowds because this is the only where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience had tonight many people do not know that wing commander is based on star wars computer game found this very interesting considering this fact almost says that wing commander is star wars movie it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though freddie prinze jr stars in the as christopher blair wing commander was huge mistake for freddie this was definitely his worst performance date after januarys she is all that actually saw good actor in freddie but now all those visions have been crushed for now anyway christopher blair is pilot who is part of the battle stop the kilrathi group that is trying destroy the earth blairs parents also fought in the space battles and also died there his parents were pilgrims so many people disrespect him because of this blair is under the command of angel played saffron burrows and he is friends another pilot todd maniac marshall played matthew lillard matthew lillard seems play the same role in every movie and he does in this one too his character as stu in scream was great one but now it seems like that same role is being played again only in space movie the three are just small part of large group trying stop the kilrathi before they take over earth this plot is very flimsy and does not give whole lot work at all this explains why wing commander drags on seeming like there is no point any of the events that are going on the acting is horrible in wing commander many lines seem out of place and are completely meaningless the acting and dialogue was so terrible even found myself laughing at it the other things are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music the special effects are very unrealistic when looking at two ships flying side side it is simple tell they are hanging and blue screen is behind them the explosions look very unrealistic as well ship will be blown up but there will only be fire present four about one half of second this is very unrealistic music pretty much accompanies the the entire time the music also felt like video game music and it was very corny and annoying sounding after we are given the plot the repeats itself for another hour without any plot twists interesting scenes or anything important the blair is forced make jumps over other planets and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft for the entire length of the movie it takes place in space it is truly like you are in video game because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for long extended period of time it is not much fun watch at all if wanted watch people shoot at each other in ships would go watch star wars at home at least star wars pays attention people myth feelings and has some real plot it the bottom line bring on the phantom menace th century fox,0.0

vampires starts out almost in the style of spaghetti western an attack on small homestead in new mexico the house has nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading team of vampire hunters in clean them out while the initial imagery is little overdramatic it gives way what is fairly decent action sequence that is enough action last us while and we could director john carpenter would let us get story line but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene then there is only bit more of plot before the next action scene after that the plot is kept minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end and that is something of pity because the based on the book vampire john steakley gives us myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined religious imagery this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire but carpenter decides tell us about it rather than show it what carpenter saves his serious screen time for sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires there is lot of fighting and lots of gore anything intriguing is kept minimum so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action fans this has not always been carpenters style his version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer do little thinking about the films central science fictional question jack crow heads vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires hightech spears and crossbows in the early part of the his team is wiped out particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off who crow is now crow team is gone and he is down himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico if this is sounding like very tired police corruption plot few obvious substitutions that is exactly what it is the same story looks just as well two partner cops looking for gang of hood who are themselves looking for packet of heroin but carpenter goes against familiar principle of show people do not tell them just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexicowhat do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come be vampire hunter and why devote his life it the answers any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog now if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona woods plays particular sort of cool lowlife very well but carpenter leads off the having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target woods does not work as larger than life mythic hero that is not his style and it just does not work very well there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses in one scene we are looking at motel room dead people on the floor one female corpse is on the floor in front of chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret these vampires do not maintain low profile there are arguably logical flaws in the there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires it would take some rationalization explain why in some scenes sunlight has dramatic effect on vampires yet in scene toward the end vampire can walk under burned roof that lets him be swept beams of sunlight suspect that the book on this was based was better thought out while might recommend this an action audience would say that what look for in vampire vampires rates on the scale and on the scale perhaps will read the book,0.0

weighed down tired plot lines and spielbergs reliance on formulas _saving private ryan_ is mediocre nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches there ought be law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics spielbergs greatest strength as director is the polished formulaic way in every aspect of the falls carefully into place make perfect story but for topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on pr mission pull young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after dday ryan is paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france there is no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making great war movie the equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done the opening sequence in captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat another pleasing aspect of the is spielbergs brave depiction of scenes largely unknown american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foulups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops the technical side of the is peerless as always the camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems mite out of place as paratroop colonel yet the attempt at realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something can be represented single instances or events it has thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the or the story fails convince throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning death relative frequency for example we see only one man guts spilled out on the ground here and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling man safety there is an explosion and miller looks back see he is only pulling half man but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact there are no shoes only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are smattering of wicked head wounds the relentless dehumanization of the war in even corpses failed retain any indentity is softpedaled in the ultimately _saving private ryan_ bows both convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is realistic it would be better describe it as having realistic moments another aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing anyone familiar the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussells superb _wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war_ has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup who is this private ryan that we have die for him asks one infantrymen in the group of eight rendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have get our dicks shot off for him or some variant thereof conversations should have been literally sprinkled the word and largely about the search for food and sex this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an rating due violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated make it family however the most troubling aspect of the is the spielbergization of the topic the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg he cannot just cede control the material he has be bigger than it as if afraid let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has package it in hallmark moments give the war meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from _schindlers list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain millers last words private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back kill the captain that particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the nowhere in the is there resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste characterized the experience of war the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed friendly fire or collateral damage because of its failure mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows,0.0
if you are going make twohour injoke why bother releasing it the general public if you are going create that will appeal primarily bigname actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons playing it in theaters while watching celebrity realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating story about real people what he really wanted do was continue on his recent kick of conceited selfdeprecation celebrity is yet another in allen tells story about himself living in world that he is familiar dealing people like the ones he actually knows allen recruited poor kenneth branagh bumble through this picture in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the more branagh plays lee simon journalistturnedscreenwriter who divorces his wife robin judy davis shacks up some hot women famke janssen charlize theron winona ryder and goes about trying get big stars melanie griffith leonardo dicaprio read his script about an armored car robbery the usual elements of recent allen films are all here including the sexual insecurity of the main character lots of selfloathing women and tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related one another unless you work in the industry or know woody allen personally it is not likely that you will find whole lot of interest in celebrity aside from all the injokes the story falls far short of compelling and the characters are all empty and lifeless branagh proves once again that he is superb performer nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly the problem is that he is the same character allen always plays character who is getting more than little dull watch mean come on how many times have you seen this guy he hates his work and he cannot be satisfied any one woman and at the end of the movie nothing has been solved he brings all of his problems upon himself crashing his car because he is receiving fellatio and other such stunts so it is pretty hard care about him in addition is not allen capable of creating characters who are not just like him know he is but he did not do it in celebrity the vacant emotional attachment the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances davis playing the same woman low selfesteem that she played in deconstructing harry has few touching moments but ends up the same despicable celebritytype that fills the rest of the movie some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty theron and ryder especially but they are not likable people only famke janssen as book editor interested in simons new novel has any life the men in the picture do not do much better joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin while dicaprio as christian slaterjohnny depptype spoiled young actor is funny but disengaging what is really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its themes are allen seems think that he is making an insightful movie about the way normal people look at celebrities the main problem this is that the character whom we are supposed identify simon is not normal guy he is just as entrenched in the image as the rest of the characters the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us none of them register as realistic interesting characters they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue in addition allen decides he needs scene in the theme is expressed explicitly robin in this scene says something like it is interesting see the way we all look at the people we celebrate celebrity is arguably allens biggest misfire date it does have few good scenes therons superorgasmic model character is kind of funny and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the shown us character or two but celebrity is failure at the core unless allens point was make selfindulgent movie about himself and his friends if he wanted make his audience feel like they were on the outside of big joke then he succeeded in that for one do not enjoy feeling like an outsider,0.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the antishark repellant adam west in the batman feature casually kicking at patheticlooking rubber shark attached his leg had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is disasterously bad easily the worst in the series date and fairly epitomizes cinematic definition of the word excessive it is loud garish and obnoxious pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces clutter up the screen elaborate production design the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman chris odonnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemicallyinduced villains the nefarious icecold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed weapon freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love her not that the dust is really necessary accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them poisoned kiss ivys side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson grunting hulk of beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds power his climate suit in order keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order devise cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivys intent is restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsmans screenplay for the is ridiculous and laughably bad astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful bythenumber plot simply coasts along and fails generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsmans screenplay of batman forever thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison am still astonished that cheesy plot device would seen used in no joke an episode of gilligans island somehow make its way into multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumachers direction of batman and robin is horrific terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is clear conceit towards neon in this even moreso than his previous batman forever the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case suppose if they ever happen forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and neon prominently figuring in an utterlypointless fight sequence bane and street gang over ivys chosen new abode another action sequence fails serve any useful point other than chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving latenight motorcycle race barbara and some gotham goons mr schumachers focus for batman and robin appears be make the as visually striking as possible the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the between allout camp and heartfelt drama the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group was burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the films opening even before single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed be campy think it is it is hard imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed be as overly campy as it turned out be somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and such graveness that the impression is made that the is not attempting be the utter farce it is arnold schwarzenegger is topbilled in the as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that villain can be mr schwarzeneggers attempts be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable the end of the was stifling chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering nearunintelligble puns and oneliners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little do in batman and robin being overshadowed the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris odonnell is unimpressive in onenote performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails make any impression at all the films one saving grace undoubtably uma thurmans entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly overthetop but in controlled fashion works splendidly within the tone of the ms thurmans comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers make campiness work successfully am already starting positively reassess jim carreys performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the and when she is offscreen the greatly suffers figure that if one has die being kissed death uma thurman is not halfbad way go while batman and robin was hardly ride of pulsepounding excitement must admit that

this is one of the worst bigscreen experiences have had for while this plus showgirls and basic instinct paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors his celebrated total recall was admit successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws obviously nobody wanted invest too much money in production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in starship seemed fake but not everything bad in the was the directors fault even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards expected five for the acting categories casserole vanity devoid dense ribald dingy miasma and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school no they have pass primary school drama classes first while total was written well starship is purely pathetic all right it is supposed be fastpaced entertainment and you are supposed turn off your intellect completely and enjoy the action sequences and special effects that is guts and gore as matter of fact found the activity incredibly boring complete waste of more than two hours half of the was bad episode of beverly hills dina meyer was in beverly hills while another quarter was simply nothing things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web and the rest was display of humans fighting computergenerated images the battles were all the same jumping around shoot or get stabbed and on barren planets that only had giant insects there were not even any stunts consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around wonder what the insects eat if there is nothing but them on the planets there is so much laughable treatment in this and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended this type of story is obviously aimed at yearolds who cannot see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality but then there are always yearolds who have that frame of mind the pointless plot begins when johnnys vanity devoid girlfriend carmen richards decides that she wants join the troopers fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth johnny then signs up as trooper also after an overacted argument his parents but there is another girl dizzy meyer who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen results in love quadrangle is not better because it means augmented worsethanstereotyped soap opera increased bitchiness and more bad beverly hills melrose and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid anyway getting back the thing you might call plot johnny is too stupid be pilot and has join the infantry while his girl and the other dude are in the same league dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also they then start training contains what roger ebert calls ips idiot plot syndrome moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes then real combat and guess what that is about as complex as it gets oh and one of their friends carl neil patrick harris k doogie howser d becomes involved in war intelligence and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want spray insecticide on someone for it he is my fifth nom for razzie the troopers fight fall in love die kill and try act naturally they win or sort of halfwin of course in between and at the end there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused bug legs the bugs also suffer from ips why would you release hold of your captive before killing it is not it also amazing that earthlings have not invented better handheld weapons then the only question that remains is why gave it one star instead of zero well maybe aquarter of star for the originality of the cosex shower scene and the very brief moments of suspense another quarter for copying zulu and letting the good guys the bugs win and half star for the suckingout of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors but there should have been more the troopers deserved die,0.0

in french the phrase noir literally means black webster defines it as type of crime featuring cynical malevolent characters in sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed shadowy photography and foreboding background music classic noir including such memorable fare as the big sleep the original cape fear and orson welles striking touch of evil employed black and white photography emphasize the long shadows associated the genre color came into play neonoir films like chinatown and blade runner a confidential easily the best of is wonderful piece of contemporary neonoir filmmaking for textbook example of how take all the elements of neonoir and create an absolute mess there is palmetto based on just another sucker short story written british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase palmetto shows what happens when filmmaker puts style ahead of substance director volker schlondorff tin drum the handmaids tale stated we were not even sure for long time if it was going be thriller or comedy it shows palmetto is too preposterous too be taken seriously as thriller and too ponderous work as comedy the story begins when journalist harry barber woody harrelson is released from prison someone turned states witness and revealed that harry was framed reward for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto bitter and broke harry plans hitchhike miami and start his life over but exgirlfriend nina gina gershon appears return him palmetto while hanging out at bar he notices that beautiful woman has left her purse in phone booth harry pockets her cash only have the woman reappear and catch him her money in his pocket no problem though the radiant blonde is rhea malroux elisabeth shue the young wife of very rich older man heart problems and she has proposition for harry rhea needs threatening voice and someone collect the ransom for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny the girls want bilk halfmillion dollar ransom from the old man and will happily give harry for helping the scam things go wrong of course odette is found dead leaving harry frantically trying dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks in an ironic twist harry is asked work for the local a office they need press liaison field questions about odettes kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job not bad setup for noir if only schlondorff knew how handle the material but he never settles on consistent tone the actors do not know what do their characters either muddling the proceedings even further as if that was not enough the story suffers from major problems in logic woody harrelson is talented actor an admirable willingness take on risky parts but he is lost here presented as crusading journalist who was horribly wronged it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough get caught up in this scheme harrelson clearly does not know what do harrys character so he spends most of the glowering sweating and generally acting miserable meanwhile elisabeth shue gives goofy performance behaving like vamp on nitrous oxide as the stepdaughter chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr despite number of steamy scenes there is no chemistry between harrelson and the women make matters worse schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the characters lips are running over each others bodies two particularly bad scenes highlight the films problems while driving body in his trunk harry has minor car wreck and cop shows up the officer wants help change harrys flat tire and asks him open the trunk harrys pathetic attempts keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy but under schlondorffs grim direction the scene is just embarrassing the films nadir comes when bad guy prepares kill harry and nina we are supposed be horrified watching our hero dangling over bathtub filled acid but this point the has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over vat of dip had palmetto been played tongue firmly in cheek it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story but under the harsh direction of schlondorff the is just sluggish paintbynumbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness avoid this nonsense and go see a confidential instead,0.0

it happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters this years crop already seems inferior that of past summers even lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world the marketing blitz in has been centered on godzilla heeere leezerd leezerd does not make me optimistic about future summers godzilla is of course based on series of cult movies translation really bad movies only few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations that this bigbudget remake will not rise above its roots is fairly obvious the credits show us the origin of godzilla in five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard sounds like an enquirer headline does not it the mushroom cloud is followed the inevitable discovery sequence this time japanese guy is eating noodles chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling if that as not stereotype when he discovers the telltale radar blip people die cut our protagonist played matthew broderick he makes his first appearance wearing headphones warbling along singin in the rain it is nonetoosubtle sign that he wishes he were in classier movie no dice bueller from the beginning poor matthew has do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzillas enormous footprint every disaster movie has have knowitall scientist and this time broderick is it as the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms and would not you love have that printed on your business card broderick is invaluable the government he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is dinosaur because hey you cannot take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members broderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is radiated lizard the radiation is not an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes believe this is mutated abberation he continues and lightning strikes again it is vocabulary lightning you see activated words of four syllables or more meanwhile we are introduced our new york cast headed an ambitious broadcast journalist maria patillo brodericks former love gee what are the odds their paths will cross again at dramatically important time poor patillo has been trying get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down heartless anchorman harry shearer italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she is not ruthless enough nice does not get you anywhere in this town it is dog eat dog actually it is lizard eat city as godzilla emerges from the atlantic begin rampage on the big apples core the filmmakers provide us onenote drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla think have got bite he announces as gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him you can guess what happens next similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps one new yorker remarks please do not tell me that is another parade please do not tell me that is the best line you could come up mayor ebert is not pleased played the principal from head of the class he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option and bickers his assistant gene guess the filmmakers knew they would be getting two thumbs down from the critics and did not even bother kiss ass the problem is if you are going attack siskel and ebert you should at least make it funny dialogue like did not we agree that we were not going have any sweets until after the election followed back off gene just does not work for me other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick characters last name and frenchman jean renos inability find good cup of coffee in new york there is even more fun be had as godzilla progresses as the beast heads back into hiding broderick suggests the military lure it out food cue twelve dump trucks all dropping fish into new york intersection broderick that is lot of fish that ambush fails but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came new york buying worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them yep godzillas children makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough have sex godzilla that is until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp godzilla comes us from the makers of independence day so it has lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots look no further than patillos betrayal of broderick patillo what have done animal what have become and the climactic godzillas nest sequence in madison square garden the main difference is independence day was about the experience it had real global patriotic element it and some genuinely fun characters godzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna yes bumble bee actually paid be known as the official tuna of godzilla that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie,0.0
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this in couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion compare it little series of films called lethal weapon now personally remember those films as starring major motion picture star being funny having great action sequences great chemistry decent character development hmmm okay now on my review of chill factor plot graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto malicious plan an exarmy general propose nuclear device international prospects when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over an army base before the contraption ticks over degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people critique speed on an icecream truck is probably the pitch that was used sell this onetone movie its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this that tensionfilled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that and the lethal weapon movies stood for this is seasoned in cliches plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in complete an overall bad movie recipe my friend and enjoyed watching this movie certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had crack up that and the formula for the films script followed the proverbial and you guessed it scenario and what about all those catchy hip names get us relate the characters elvis and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys come up this regurgitated drivel it is unfathomable me as how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall most probably the latter have you seen either fled or bulletproof well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here you get black guy and white guy being chased bunch of people having no choice but work together get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning respect one another as individuals yawn add that the fact that our actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black drive black cars and black vans and run around all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head not too conspicuous eh call me partypooper but as much as like nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this just does not even try do anything original or reasonably entertaining one cool scene boat careening down mountainside and another nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not fun buddyaction flick make show cuba the money everybody little known facts about this and its stars this is not little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like greatlooking actor johnny depp skeets reallife nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito he stands was born in north carolina and got married in that sexkitten actress from clay pigeons georgina cates they own farm together in virginia and seven dogs skeet has long scar on his chest from openheart surgery done when he was correct ventricle defect actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york in he breakdanced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles he stands actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guysgirls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior this reportedly had budget of million am not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut this was the cinematographer on the white squall and the demi moore vehicle i jane,0.0
it is some sad irony that screened fright night part on the day that one of it is stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in having career that spanned over years and appearing in more than films fright night part probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles this is really sad considering how good the first fright night was william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us at least in the movies anyway it has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and bmovie actor turned late night horror host peter vincent mcdowall came face face real live vampire who just happened be charlies next door neighbor charlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family apparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor had sister who was none too pleased find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling so she decides exact little bit of revenge this ends up forcing charlie and peter battle the forces of darkness yet again one of the things that made fright night such success was chris sarandon who played charlies stylish next door neighbor taste for blood fright night part tries duplicate that modern style but it falls sort while they are stylish the vamps in this just do not have the personality of the undead in the first the exception of werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief few of the scenes one bright spot speaking from strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend it is really shame that her career has not been better since she made this ragsdale does fair job in this but does not give nearly the performance that he did in the original roddy mcdowall makes the most what he is given unfortunately is not much is shame because his character was lot of fun in the original movie guess would have say that the first was superior product in every way the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part had more of the feel of music video never good thing for horror another minus for part was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something jump out of shadow where very rare for that matter they were almost nonexistent if was going watch horror this would be far from my first choice the first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list if was in the mood for roddy mcdowall would probably head the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes either way fright night part would most likely not enter into the equation,0.0

there is not much good about this movie not much can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie so will get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin did not direct it or it would be titled technicolor city in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down the bitter end the plot has tendency be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been fascinating movie the plot is impossible explain due how senseless it gets so will just touch on the bare minimum john murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of cheap hotel only find out he has forgotten everything john must find out who he is before the strangers k mind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy during the some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people any of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script as mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this the acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems care the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake sign of true bmovie the direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in movie switching realities constantly lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and does not deserve have the word science in sciencefiction if have not got my point across will say it more plainly this is bad movie lets hope the next movie alex wish was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable,0.0

mission mars is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie all five minutes of it mission does give you payoff but when it does come it is too little too late mission has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dimeadozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles am sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm glances do not communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end the spends an hour on this kind of stuff building its climax lot of it is cliched glorification of family relationships marriage friendship unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this and give it points for trying stay true the science know trying is the key word here the sequence the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching but as mentioned then we are so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie be over great design good intentions but no cigar if you are not die hard scifi fx or jerry oconnell fan his character is the only one who has some semblance of character do not waste your eight bucks on this and what the hell tim robbins died halfway through the movie in stupid way too that is just unforgiveable,0.0
my friend here in school just made two minutelong for one of his classes that includes staged anal rape scene done two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident banana being used as the instrument of penetration as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments have ever witnessed sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive some but is riotously amusing the rest then there is caligula this features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies greasedup fist forced up mans rear wine poured down man who is had his urinary tracts tied off penis chopped off and fed hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be respectable and if could have been had the following not occurred the events were graphically shot in clear view the tone was not that of trying shock comically but well show historical accuracy the was million dollar production lavish sets rather impressive cast and whopping hour running time produced and funded none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there is sense that everything this is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining after all it is not really the fact that this features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry no should be discarded because its content because is never about what it is about it is about how it is about as the old cliche goes those who bash this for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem caligula and that is that it is nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start finish without second of credibility in its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as blessing or so guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons the opens on the wrong note of course quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the overused passage what shall it profit man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around his own sister in field suppose if one has lose their soul one has have soul in the first place the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played the great malcom mcdowell performance that does the opposite that his performance in clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but cannot wait for the current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather die so he kills him and ascends the throne then he abuses his position marries woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor not exactly acting so he does not just have sleep his sister dreadful teresa ann savoy there be pretty naked and willing hop in the sack mac or anyone he asks her hop in abuses his position little more little more and little more and then believe invades england then is killed off the filler instead of recounting his life is supposed be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity but instead of being the historical accurate it really really wants be it instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like oh is not it great that they just loved having sex and that they killed people so disgustingly and would not it be great if could make couple bucks selling this shit off as accuracy even though it is so blatantly real bad porn that have completely convinced myself that it is not mean why not just show roman orgy when can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up and it is not just that it is disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want use describe this it is that in where the entire feel it is going for is not felt it is also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time the sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that wonder if no historian wanting have his name on this explains this but that does not matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark the camera operation is also the worst have ever seen in my entire life not only does this hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible follow there is no writer speak of what the hell does it mean that it is adapted from an original screenplay gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that cannot in good faith believe that anyone an iq over could say them straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but care he could last year or so the music in this is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt give the some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots guccione himself are so obviously removed from everything else in this that it only adds the embrassment every five seconds or so the cuts random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this is rated john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra am going kill my agent am going kill my agent and so on and so on for over hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying guccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made that is such painstaking arduous task watch in its entirety that doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage throughout the entire the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what can get away and if you do not like this then you are prig and worse than that you know nothing about history uh huh there is clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that is artistically good showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for good but using historical accuracy as licence get away any kind of disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts is total total bullshit and all can say is that guccione and the makers of this have lost any kind of touch either entertainment or eroticism and have developed pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this there is that came out in called the cook the thief his wife and her lover magnifcent legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren deals graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even little cannibalism for good measure that not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in way that was shocking yes but also in bizarre way entertaining and totally involving there were real characters there in real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not get off on the fact that it is going be offensive many that achieved everything it wanted do and has since retained status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good and it is everything caligula might have been but alas was not,0.0
remember back in the mid when crime and macabre movies were all the rage pulp fiction and fargo both managed get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter that fad seems be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection does not look like anything comprehendable it is crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has claustrophobic atmosphere that will not allow the story much room expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages turn simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous complexity should come as no surprise anyone who is familiar mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects has become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim that had great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings you have wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the idea that if it is really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating the way of the gun mcquarrie seems be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial shame because maybe that would have helped the tells the story of two drifters no ambition and barely reason live but are not hellbent on death either played ryan phillipie and benecio del toro they get lucky when they hear about scheme between bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going have baby through in vitro fertilization they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played juliette lewis and get nice ransom along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played james caan the only actor in the who looks like he knows what he is doing the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cannot call the authorities for help his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers get the mother back the execs son is doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants make sure his patient is all right meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all mcquarrie does not know the meaning of the word simple he seems be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making good movie everything has be complicated and confusing so much so that it is the point of surrealism nothing is what it seems in this reality it is one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected know most of the industrys rules and regulations every scene caans character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and we are hardly given clue as what they are talking about these characters are probably supposed be great criminal sketches but they are more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash no one here really acts like real person and the story is even further removed from reality it is like dream without any appeal take the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in parking lot across the street from bar or club counting their money and stuff they sit on brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them get away from his car but they do not move the guy and his loudmouth pottymouth girlfriend and about other people cross the street and gang up on them you would think phillipe and del toro are going pull out guns and scare them away but they do not instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down mob there is lot of things did not understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes is not some yuppie or old rich snob he is like hippie straight out of the secondly the two main characters seem believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed lastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the the two are packing more artillery than small countrys army if they were suicidal they would not have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either there is lot more could pick apart about this but that would be an exercise in futility what it all comes down is that nothing here is what it seems would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable and it is all coated thin layer of black comedy is good for chuckle here and there but this is definitely not flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like desperate attempt kill screen time any you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was it why someone would want make it and why someone would want see it cannot say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and cannot imagine anyone intelligently defending it,0.0

there is good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first new movie about the abuses of our prison system country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare recent american moviesa point of view but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important there is not moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling and everything suffers christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial his young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine stanley kramer production shot hyperactive school students there is very little praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story there is lot of overacting from everyoneyou know you are in trouble right away when lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as judge the center of reason and moderation slater has never been convincing and certainly is not here and oldman is on bad streak of hammy performances but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling good story there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone them how frustrating it must be for actors work under these conditions if there is anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability tell good story have we forgotten,0.0
this is the worst movie have viewed so far in the avengers silly man dressed in bowler hat woman wearing tight leathers evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt the question is what could have gone wrong potentially great idea big name cast the same question was probably asked of last years stinker batman and robin feel the production got little too smug the script little smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together form movie my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed thurman and fiennes something that was vital element of the tv serial of the same name the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks but does not allow much room for character development and interaction except perhaps grate on the viewers nerves one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality connery as sir august does not fair better than thurman or fiennes his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather mostly embarrassing and poor quality if there is movie you would prefer never see believe the avengers would be good choice for one thing you will not have witness product that is far inferior the three high profile names that is associated the title cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released but put it down one of those freak happenings in nature like lightning you cannot see it coming until it hits you,0.0

mr bean bumbling security guard from england is sent la help the grandiose homecoming of masterpiece american painting the first two words should have said enough let you know what occurs during beans trip la but if they did not look out because you are in for rather interesting if not odd ride heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick either way look out america bean is coming well what can really be said about this movie there is very little discernible plot that much is not hard grapple for it is slapstick comedy it achieves that goal rather admirably but because it is that the plot is just screaming for help the whole premise that the movie is based on is say the least flawed the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on whim and carried through and in many causes adlibbed as you went do not go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie even if you do not like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because somethings are just so stupid the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims or so it seems now when you look at the acting in this movie you have think about two things first was there any real acting and how hard is it act in the slapstick manner well there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick was not the easiest am sure have concede that mr atkinsons acting in this movie is well done although the role is not too demanding the slapstick is think that the character could have had bit more dialogue it would have added quite bit the overall effect of the movie now the rest of the actors in the movie bad acting and poor casting think that the role opposite bean could have been better just seemed wrong for the movie different actor might have done better job of it but wont presume that was not what was trying be achieved one thing that must say simply get if off my chest is that think transferring sitcom tv usually produces rather disastrous results tv shows should do just that stay on tv it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers can only think of couple examples of tv going the big screen effectively the best known of those would have be star trek bean seriously fails accomplish anything close what that series gone movie achieved now another thing that have state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly the form of humor in this movie will not be liked most people these people will think like did that this movie is stupid and pointless but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie but be on the safe side am opting recommend you save your money and not go see this movie there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one,0.0

a silly that tries be black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy its main asset being beautiful location along spains mountainous coastline howard pigeon jeff goldblum is yearold mineral water salesman who is married for years wife constantly nagging him elizabeth mimi rogers after surprise birthday party for him where his wife bawls him out for coming late his surprise party he confides his best friend that he cannot stand it anymore and then tells him his plan kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon jeff is going through severe midlife crises worried that he looks older than his age he incessantly talks himself mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out elizabeth for second time and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive he stutters and acts like man who has lost his confidence things change on their vacation as elizabeth makes an effort be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting when other hotel guests and staff come check about the gunshot he nervously explains that it was the tv realizing how unworkable his plan is he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip and when after great deal of effort get reservation at the hotels star restaurant he insists on eating in the room she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him as result he goes the police report her missing while the police telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants be alone his boss and all those he works are sympathetic him and he gets job promotion but soon the pillow the gun is fished out of the water giving the police cause arrest him and search his home there they find letters he has written incriminating him the murder the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room in jail things look bad for him no one believes him including his friends and lawyer his boss fires him and the papers have field day the headline story pigeon jailbird out on bail he realizes that his only hope is track down his wife through call placed on his credit card he tracks her down mountain resort once there he learns that she took hike up the steep mountain and he gets priest be his mountain guide after telling him the true story the is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance he is someone coming apart the seams while mimi rogers is his perfect foil it was mostly pantomine humor the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation very minor farce that might appeal the sitcom crowd the just did not take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it so it had no chance for black humor develop it instead played its setup of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value see how many chuckles it could draw,0.0
be warned the following review contains some harsh language the blair witch project quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time if you want see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more and this worked for him well am sorry but nothing is nothing nothing is not more it is nothiiiiiinggggggggggg do not pay dollars see nothing nothing is free available all around the world at location near you am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary could just discount them and say well guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow but have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that does not hold water there must be some other reason then again maybe my first thought is correct think will try pointing their shadow out them one day and test their reaction when hear people praising this never hear them talking about what makes up about of this movie three kids bickering each other about being lost they only talk about what might make up possibly minutes of screen time this being few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh over and over this should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost and argue each other oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh and if you thought that was scary wait till you see pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants fear oh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks you have never seen terror like this folks and you do not want the chevy chasegoldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this for current films highly recommend the sixth sense or stir of echoes for creepy filmgoing experience this is an example of marketing no substance the marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the they want this be good and think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they do not have anything else praise that wonderful that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it this could have been so much better just think if maybe there had been only minutes of arguing about being lost and minutes of nighttime stuff saw this movie girl who was extremely pumped for it she was sold on this and then at one point during it she turned me and asked are we supposed be scared this have heard one opinion that you have use your imagination create the fear in this movie well thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed do use their imagination and create good movie mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay bucks for it but even if you like this idea then what are you imagining an entity called the blair witch some rednecks fucking these kids are either of these things really scary when you think about it have heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be be out in the woods and hear something well sure thats scary in real life but there are lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in movie nor even interesting you could sit in your house and see snake or spider and it could be scary but in it would not be and no movie does not need big budget or cgi special effects be scary or creepy actually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting but you have do something you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real and the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch are not these supposed be filmmakers who should know how point camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly am not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified that is justified am talking about the other minutes of the movie where they cannot seem shoot anything smoothly at all minor quibble there there is feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way the bank and think there is good chance they will see this again and say themselves what was thinking but if they do not then thats fine if it works for them then that is okay guess just lament that making this movie hit we are going be subjected more of the nothing is more approach pretty soon we are going get some movies like this just still shot of prison jail cell for minutes and we will have use our imagination and think ourselves my god would not it be scary spend life in prison this movie is the scariest movie of all time or shot of coffin some funeral directors arguing each other man do you know how scary it would be die now this is the scariest movie of all time r,0.0
let me start off saying that leading up the release of the latest bond really was not looking forward it as much as have some of the previous films am not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the everpresent dread that the next will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years am happy report that any doubts were erased after about the first minutes of the that point it was evident that mr bond was back vengeance all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the were not exactly pleasant experience it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed be turned off when the movie starts it took reminder from an audience member clue them in guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain anyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for settled in for bond think the most noticeable aspect of this the th in the series is that it really goes back the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films there were probably more oneliners in this movie than in the last several combined and bonds last oneliner in the is about the best of the series the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series everything from wild boat chases the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems be no way out for for the most part the action sequences worked very well although there were couple of times that thought some things were bit over the top even for bond think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted while he did good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action most noticeably sequences on snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie he almost seemed like he did not know what he was doing but they were brief scenes and really should not take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing if you have ever seen bond you will not be shocked learn that plot has never been their strong suit the world is not enough is no exception this time we have yet another over villain that bond has stop for the good of the world matches wits the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who has bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious pain why this point is included is beyond me they took great pains explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought anyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving mideast oil pipeline guess world domination just is not as attractive terrorists as money making venture anymore bond is brought in protect the pipelines owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renards recent victims along the way bond has enlist the help of nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle like all bond films you basically just have suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films there was at least one point that had stop and try remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing the buddy that saw the movie was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceaus character it was alluded earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the later it became big part of the story and left him the distinct feeling that he had missed something but because it is bond the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem make you forget about script problems quite quickly after all it is not shakespeare how about the cast brosnan seems get better each of his appearances as grew up the roger moore version of bond so really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings the character judi dench as had bigger role in this than in her two previous appearances in the role she brought the talent her that one would expect from an oscar winner robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice see his russian mobster character revived in this movie coltrane gets more screen time simply leads him stealing even more scenes then there are the bond girls sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her natural play the innocent victim those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just pretty face marceau may be the most talented actress ever play bond love interest then we have denise richards there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks and after you see the outfits she wears you will not have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producers eyes was pleasantly surprised find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist admittedly there was one point that the audience snickered bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended her bond girl predecessors nicely must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyles character while carlyle did fine job the material that he had his character just never worked for me the producers tried very hard add more complexity his character but it just never quite got off the ground guess was hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious pain aspect of his character but the writers decided play up the emotional side of his character this might have worked well in another movie but do not go see bond movies for their deep characterizations last but not least we have desmond llewelyn as this is the th appearance for llewelyn as bonds gadget guy and he is as good as ever although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still treat watch rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role he says future appearances are up higher power the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played comedy master john cleese while we do not see much of him in this think it is fair say that desmond llewelyns legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands so how does it stack up despite some problems the world is not enough is very entertaining movie and all things considered what problems it does have are small compared some that have plagued earlier bond movies this is easily the best of the brosnan films it may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top one thing is for sure even after movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series heres looking forward bond number,1.0
seen september at m at the sony nickelodeon theaters boston ma theater matt perreault for free using my sonyloews critics pass theater rating okay seats sound and picture modern society is now inundated more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before from teenage sitcoms ncrated films about fetishes the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it your friends and neighbors takes different approach as it is that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within small circle of friends one of the most important aspects of the that most be noted and analyzed before the can really be dissected as whole is writerdirector neil labutes basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs tell the story firstly and most importantly is the fact the script tells rather complex detailed story of lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed and just plain stupidity between six different characters three men three women without hardly any supporting characters few have line or two mostly extras everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come fullcircle back themselves whether it be positive or negative but just state this is arbitrary and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult labutes ability tell his story through few characters is remarkable feat but what is specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll for the sake of this review will describe the characters and refer them as their main characteristic another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside limited focus we are always able tell where the characters are someones home the gym restaurant hotel room etc but what the city they live in what year it is what the society is like etc is relatively unknown the is complete character study the tight intense drama of the theater no one plot dominates the story makes the first act bit tedious for its lack of background we are simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected figure out the rest the characters are group of middleclass white people who are all successful at what they do but they are only concern right now seems be their sex lives first there is barry eckhart and mary brenneman married couple who are going through dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who do not know what they are problem is barry is kind of dorky businessman who loves his wife and the sex they have but does not have lot of ambition he just follows everyone else mary is writer of some sort but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character but ironically does not hesitate commit adultery just feel something labutes script does good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two obviously this is the theme is enhanced the actors good performances but at the same time seems just bit hollow another couple is jerry stiller and terri keener who live together and seem have been involved each other for long time yet they constantly argue over anything and everything their sex life is also fraught problems and for some reason they continue do it throughout their infidelitous relationship if only one aspect of the could use improvement it would be this area it is natural for married couple become bored each other but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue have sex and live together what did they ever see in the other person begin labute never really answers but since the is more concerned the payoff than the process it still makes for good drama tension and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it is fascinating two other characters act as catalysts cary jason patric and cheri natassja kinski cary is an arrogant hostile sexmaniac who defines the word bastard somehow he is able bend women his will either through charm or just attitude into getting his way he is the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he is secretly perverted but somehow barry finds comfort in his company although jerry is always nervous around him patric gives an outstanding performance so much so that we want know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is cheri is character labute uses as catalyst see how the other characters react her she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different from becoming involved in relationship one brushing it off as small talk another being outright appalled yet another she is sweet woman perhaps the most normal of any of the characters and although her symbolism is obvious her role as the outsider is the most relatable will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected the others action as that is the hook of the the first two acts begin set up the characters and eachs scenarios but it is often difficult tell what they will do about it and whom the result is sometimes surprising other times predictable but the actual course of actions is always fascinating for while everyone has their fun but ultimately each characters guilt attitude or ignorance will disserve them one of the most important things note is how realistic the story is supposed be since the characters only interact each other there is not much pop culture references as almost everything has deeper philosophy behind it are we assume that these people are as the title states our friends and neighbors do not know of anyone going through the same situations as these people often times the is not unlike network melodrama other times situations are like those not seen outside porno movie but what this does have that the others do not is repercussions in the end although the creates its own reality it goes show that even the immoral are not immortal in what way your friends and neighbors is supposed work is open interpretation it definitely has lot say about the price that comes infidelity but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically still it is an accomplishment in filmmaking because it has put timeless theme into modern perspective,1.0
the characters in palmetto collectively sweat enough fill lake erie and it is just the right way capture the films ripe atmosphere of sensuality tension and even farce this humid floridaset thriller nurtures modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself is very much good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke as far as setup is concerned the movie is nothing we have not seen before but be patient palmetto spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really do not see coming it is not classic any means but it sure is quite an engaging surprise harry barber woody harrelson is fresh out of prison where he is served couple of years for crime he did not commit even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials harrys first order of business is return his home town of palmetto be his sculptor girlfriend nina gina gershon while searching for work he catches the eye of rhea malroux elisabeth shue the mysterious sexbomb wife of palmetto millionaire rhea proposes scheme thatll get harry easy play small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny you do like risks do not you mr barber rhea alluringly coos boys form line behind me part of palmetto success can be attributed the performance of elisabeth shue who demonstrates here that her oscarnominated turn in leaving las vegas might merely be foreshadowing great things come shues seductive campy delight and pulls off barbara stanwyckgloria swanson combo admirable relish the other actors form solid ensemble around her including sevigny kids tantalizingly slutty as teen tease as well as the everlikeable gershon cast far cry from her extreme roles in bound and showgirls harrelson is still doing fine followup work the people vs larry flynt palmetto does have its share of grievances harrelsons narration is needless suppose and gershons nina cries be meatier than she ultimately is one of the plots unexpected angles that harry is asked the police become the press liaison for the very crime in he is involved could have been played little better there are moments when you question the tone but it is never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it is been receiving from most other critics if palmetto did not want be laughed at would it really have tacked on climax that plays like liveaction who framed roger rabbit although few elements can be questioned the movie works well on its own terms thanks juicy cast especially shue and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff you remember him from last summers suddenly repopular the tin drum right everything runs smoothly and for fans of revelationheavy endings this films got few shocks in store that will not even dream of revealing palmetto is generous amount of fun watch and that is all you need know,1.0

the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately what that whole clinton thing going on you know million bucks discover the president got boinked an intern oh please government waste my taxes just bit more would you it is about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement this and crimson tide he is created two successfully chilly films that are interesting exciting even pretty smart but never totally riveting as cinema and the problem think each of these films is that each is too obsessed its message ever be really satisfying and too obsessed looking all cutting edge ever be totally smart that dealt civil war inside nuclear submarine over whether or not follow rules or question them and was appropriately scary and all but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant enemy of the state is the same way it is engrossing for its entire running time and it is scary the way that it shows mans decent into kafkaism but it is too technical it is too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be it casts will smith one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he is charming and witty and never uninteresting and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough really be person hate do this but last years the game got it damn perfect it casts michael douglas as deeply flawed human being man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life and then pulls everything he thought he had as security blanket away from him and watched what happened the result was not only that was exciting and chilling but also the best mindfuck of the entire year not that want every kafkaesque be the game this years the spanish prisoner succeeds less thrills and chills but it should be an example of what works and what does not will smiths character is frankly too perfect at least too movie perfect he had an affair another woman lisa bonet ha ha but his relationship his wife regina king is basically fine regardless he has kid and he is raking in money as lawyer albeit very good and reasonably moral one so he generally does not have any real problems as human being and is therefore boring except that he is played will smith who embodies him about as much will smith charm as he can without entering id men in black territory he is good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he is not great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character makes the lack any real deep interesting qualities smith becomes involved in mass conspiracy involving the assasination of senator opposed government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier control when he is passed disk of the event caught on tape an outside party nature observer played uh jason lee the government wants the disk and is prepared destroy his life get it as smiths plight is dramatized we are introduced the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than speeding bullet these guys played jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this because they are well fascinating they are doing their jobs are evil but the does not view them as such and they almost become our friends we like these guys for the sole reason that the does not automatically judge them as the villains they are also scary because we get the idea that they are not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world it is as if they are obsessed their jobs not because they are evil but because hey it is fun job and no one else can do it like them unfortunately this also backfires bit on the instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on sure you are chilled but you are not exacty freaked out what is going on but what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met fivesecond piece of he ever liked he is notbad director because hell he is always interesting watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit days of thunder but the reason he is not great is because he is too technical and calculated his shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing the imagination and they are always making sure you are paying attention this is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage entertain without any real problems despite never actually becoming great it is never actually boring and it is always intriguing watching the government setup smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smiths likeable protagonist we are setup for good two hours worth of tom clancyesque entertainment add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen everyone from gabriel byrne dan butler pop up for cameos and you have got good old fashioned escapist drama does all the thinking for you so that you never have actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smiths plight without minutes worth of boredom,1.0
mary nortons childrens book series the borrowers has been made into several belowaverage television movies so was not too enthused as entered the theater for the bigscreen debut of the minute clan but was in for shock the borrowers is actually thoroughly delightful movie plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home their aunt who owned the property never left will now an unscrupulous lawyer ocious potter john goodman plans demolish the house and replace it an ultramodern housing development but the lenders are not alone in their house living under the floorboards is family of borrowers inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human beans above the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders especially once they discover the evil potter actually has copy of the will leaves the home the lenders so it is up the clocks pod jim broadbent and homily celia imrie along their kids arrietty flora newbigin and peagreen tom felton recover the will and save the household but when potter learns of the tiny people he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff mark williams kill off the clan there is plenty of attention detail in the borrowers especially in the furnishings of the clock family house made out of lost board game parts and credit cards the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling based on an original story the screenwriters did good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for inch tall person as the villain john goodmans performance veers on the edge of being overthetop but his performance suits the role well and he does very well in the films many slapstick moments nearly seamless mix of oversized sets bluescreen shots and cgi the special effects in the borrowers are very well done there are few times when you can spot the effects at work but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled childrenonly movie for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun watch,1.0

tom dey rated pg for mild language adult situations drug use martial art action and violence minutes super mm panavision what can you say about jackie chan that has not already been said since the release of rumble in the bronx back in the s release jackie has become fairly recognizable commodity on americas video shelves having made over films jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of actioncomedy the west his latest release shanghai noon is joyful tribute spoof of the classic western and adding jackie chan into the genre the tag line for the the western gets kick in the pants rings true jackie stars as chon wang lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china the royal princess pei pei lucy liu is set be married the obnoxious son of nobleman from another prefecture unwilling follow her fathers wishes princess pei pei the assistance of her english tutor decides escape america but this is all ploy devised exiled guard lo fong will lead the princess kidnapping and ransom unable take any legal action the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden citys bravest guards played cui ya hi rong guang yu and eric chen are ordered transport the ransom payment lo fong in carson city nevada chon wang pleads the imperial court and is given permission join the team as he is looked upon as buffoon on train in the s jackie meets up bandit roy obannon owen wilson he is much less of bandit than he is glory hog looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being bandit will bring him his gang in tow roy attempts rob the train when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court who also happens be chon wangs uncle chon wang gives chase foiling the attempted robbery but also leaving himself stranded in the desert as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert he again comes upon roy who has been left for dead his former gang buried up his neck in the desert roy pleads chon dig him out chon demands know where carson city is roy directs him and chon leaves but not before sticking two chopsticks into roys mouth and telling him dig himself chon soon finds himself confronted angry crow warriors friendly sioux tribe gunslingers horse that thinks and behaves like dog and an indian bride brandon merrill before once again running into roy shanghai noon is just good fun the chemistry between the cast is remarkable the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the jackies performance is as good as anything he is done before he is not called on do much acting here as the character is not written any depth but jackies natural charisma shines through and his comic timing is so perfect both physically and surprise verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on owen wilson last seen in the embarrassing remake of the haunting gives good natured performance as roy obannon his innocence is refreshing and fun bad guy that is not really bad his scenes jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little do in the script but for change does not play nymphet or some other deviant the character is noble woman of status and wealth but finds greater cause as result of her own imprisonment the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances nothing here is realistic mind you shanghai noon is first and foremost light jovial and the performances match that style ease the cinematography dan mindel is gorgeous using calgary alberta as the prime location mr mindel is able create lush romantic western feel the nothing here really looks like nevada but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged the can be looked upon as loving tribute earlier films of the genre and as such the script alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose history but reverence past films homage such films as high noon obviously red river and most notably butch cassidy the sundance kid all bring sense of nostalgia the it is comforting experience at time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant here is that embraces those old attitudes and dare say clich and manages make them palatable and refreshing here is that is not contemptuous of the genre this is the purest horse opera since the days of george obrian or john wayne director tom dey has crafted loving tribute hollywoods past in this his first mr dey shows both love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing see nothing here really stands out or takes ones attention away from the story or action and that is as it should be when jackie chan is your star and what of the action and stunts well while not up level of drunken master or any of jackies hong kong films shanghai noon is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american before his timing choreography and creativity are still as sharp as ever jackie even gets recreate few scenes from his earlier films obvious those of us that have seen those films but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar finally jackie can honestly say that he has made an s his way and incorporating his style sum up shanghai noon is fun summer confection not too heavy and not too light fun and entertaining that the whole family can enjoy parents be advised there are scenes of smoking drunkenness and peyote use an enjoyable and charming that can and will be enjoyed again and again,1.0
the reunion is not an original idea in any way shape or form it is been done throughout history over and over again and has become one of the many subgenres like the prep school subgenre the angstfilled teen subgenre and the slasher subgenre what makes peters friends so remarkable is not how it does not follow the rules of this subgenre but how it follows it so well and creates characters that would not mind hanging what are the rules of the reunion subgenre well you need group of friends most of them married or at least dating and sometimes even married or dating eachother you need have them brought back together over some sort of crisis they are not have spoken together much since they split apart the reunion has come in intervals divisible they all have be slightly highly neurotic the reunion has bring them together seperate them little crises then bring them back together because after all they are friends there has be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or other people that are there or were invited eightly they are all unhappy or marginally so there is some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that is built up over the years the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts sometimes internationally so the is filled nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends sometimes causing them get together in dancesong since it follows these rules so closely it will probably be and has been coined off as just british big chill and in some ways it is both follow the rules as said and both feature lots of bitching big confessionals and broken relationships but while the big chill was at least me tad too whiny and unsatisfying peters friends hits its mark making this funny dramatic and poignant the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up enjoy them the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus after peters stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly on screen enough register but oh well dies leaving giant mansion him he has decide whether or not keep it not sure what do it immeadiately he decides throw giant reunion party inviting back all his old chums of course all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule andrew kenneth branagh also directing here is an actor who is unhappily married tv star carol cowriter rita rudner maggie emma thompson is successfuly publisher of selfhelp books but looks like she needs them more than her customers as she is lonely and unhappy roger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married in sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk but have suffered tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died and sarah alphonsia emmanuel is as promiscuous as ever having new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian tony slattery who is married and wants divorce because of her giving her doubts as for peter things seem okay the features lots of innerfriend jokes and even some old theatre anecdotes at least find lot of fun in as have done lots of theatre myself and there are big confessions brawls between the friends and the end almost everyone is unhappy even though some have resolved their problems long before the end kinda dug the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic but for some reason felt the same way the rest of the friends did maybe it is because the people in this are so likable that just wanted join their clique that is really what makes peters friends so lovable the way you just want hang group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes but when someones in crisis can come together wonderfully for one another it is when you have giant crisis like this and people want selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends and these people are true friends not mention kenneth branagh is able make the seem nostalgic for the a decade grew up in unfortunately without taking us outside of the there are some classics and anticlassics like tears for fears everybody wants rule the world but unfortunately no stupidfun songs think if ever did an reunion would put some crap go gos song on or at least some good old come on eileen but this is the british we are talking about oh well but anyway the direction is pretty good although nothing amazing branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical but at least he is very good making less ambiguous like this the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman lots of good oneliners and even some really bad but good puns mock the fact that andrew lives in a peter while cutting some logs asks him is he has wood in a and andrew says no but we have punishment like that the actors as in most speaking movies are better than their material though some standout performances the six friends as well as the outsiders like slattery rudner and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion little note should be made about hugh lauries performance as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this mean have never seen him actually act this dramatically peters friends is really enjoyable makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion although do not know what kind will have like most people do not look forward my high school reunion because of the way these friends are still able maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such long period of seperation just look forward the day when can have friends like that,1.0

in the sweet hereafter writerdirector atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living he shows us how it is not dying that hurts but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death and dealing the loss and grief that it brings on cold winter day in small isolated town in british columbia school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto frozen lake where it cracks through the ice and sinks fourteen children die and numerous others are hurt for the residents of this small town all of whose children were on that bus it is an earthshattering event

local motel and lost their child in the accident hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm bring lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility the bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose is kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives burden of guilt is not held responsible for the accident the bus seems have simply slipped on some ice and there was nothing should could do prevent it however according stephens there are no accidents in life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through he goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them join the class action suit and find vent for their anger and for his work stephens will receive onethird of the settlement money however it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money he is driven something else something deeper that he shares in common the grieving parents he has lost child too but not in the same manner his daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died in his arms as young child after spider bite has been in and out of drug rehab clinics and detox stations for ten years she calls him on an irregular basis begging him for money but refusing tell him what she needs it for do not know who am taking he tells her in his mind his daughter is dead the

happened and lost two children wants nothing do it he has already lost his wife and he buries his grief in an affair married woman he does not want talk about the accident and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds him the town should be able take care of its own pain and it does not need outsiders like stephens getting in the way central the sweet hereafter is the tale of nicole burnell sarah polley teenage girl who dreams of being singer before the accident turned her into wheelchair girl as she puts it aside from stephens nicole is the most complex character in the and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out it is also her sad haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack reading robert brownings poem about the pied piper and how when he led all the towns children away one was left behind because he was crippled obviously nicole is that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the towns children left her alone dying in the wreck her situation is further complicated because she is involved in loving but incestuous relationship her father tom mccamus there is only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but it is somehow tied into the final act of the of all the storylines in the sweet hereafter this is the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers if any at all and he does not condescend the audience trying neatly wrap it up what egoyan has done in the sweet hereafter is really nothing short of miraculous in his adaptation of the novel russell banks he has made deeply moving about lawyer transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared human life egoyan has always been talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold the sweet hereafter is quite the opposite egoyans stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly heighten the impact of the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy the sweet hereafter seems contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked the is filled beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind the beautiful roving camerawork paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the visual and aural cohesiveness the thematic elements like his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form blanketing whole he works time as fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present effortless ease the actual bus wreck itself does not happen until midway through the but that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can it from distance no graphic detail and still have it carry great devastating weight because human life has become such cheap commodity in movies it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple direct terms certainly one of the best films of the sweet hereafter is deeply rewarding mystifying and ultimately human,1.0
when first heard about scream in was told that it was spoof of horror movies from the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre overemphasizing them making the teenagers do what they know they are not supposed do when serial killer is stalking them do not run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say will be right back etc when first heard this description figured that it was an easy way out of making bad movie how hard is it make an extremely terrible but claim it is actually mockery of other bad movies was this wes cravens remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn it just seemed cheap me then actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and nailbitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude scream is not only clever parody of your standard horror flick it is also pretty scary movie if you have seen million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going happen this is part of the fun of watching scream the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great guilty pleasure it can be watch pointless and predictable violence innocent attractive teenagers those who rarely see these types of movies scream is thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as serious slasher there is nothing wrong that misjudgment though have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies horror and the fanatics their opinions on the were so different but both very positive from these varied reviews am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream the low budget gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential of the this influence may exist the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks its quicklypaced script kevin williamson within the are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of horror movie mainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and you are dead meat not only are we treated these rules on plate but also the rules are referenced number of different films and actors the script feels like an obsessive essay from college geek who has nothing better do but find every little blunder from every little for his own selfsatisfaction in this case williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement hear there is new movie coming out called scary movie is spoof of scream is spoof of scary movies will certainly see the but have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety however my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong so who knows,1.0

bob the happy bastards quickie review must admit no doubts single new is quite catchy it was bouncy and energetic enough get me go see this new from director doug limon the man who had brought us the humorous swingers little while back the result movie that is just as good as that song really it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend first we hear about grocery bagger sara polley who runs into monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at rave bad results as drug dealer feels he is been swindled her then comes the story of an english grocery store worker same store who heads vegas for the weekend friends where sex gunplay and stolen car trouble come into play then we see the story of two gay movie actors played scott wolf and jay mohr who deal cops strange insurance presentation and hitting girl sara their car and finally we come another grocery worker katie holmes who has strange fascination said drug dealer the one mentioned earlier really it is all confusing keep track of in review format your best bet is just well go the movie features some very good acting from all angles and limon adds the same humorous energy he had swingers this particular product the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending think of it as well ending the intertwining of stories is particularly good element the movie as it is never really confusing and tells different sides of the story like sliding doors kinda did however it is better suited for the younger generation who want little spice in their flicks sliding doors kinda is not,1.0
while watching shallow grave found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities the coens blood simple both are good films in several characters none of whom are the most conscientious have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes the body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands both films are also flawed but for different reasons blood simple is unrelentingly dark and moody but its characterizations were little hollow shallow grave on the other hand is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they would accomplished for more standard audiencepleasing ending the events of the were sufficiently intense and disturbing that honestly felt quite troubled what was witnessing on screen most of the time yet there was slight grin on my face at the end as the begins we are introduced alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox and david christopher eccleston scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious but other than that they seem like fairly normal bunch man named hugo moves into the apartments remaining vacancy and the next morning he is found dead of drug overdose juliet is about call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought him suitcase filled the brim cash presumably from criminal activities the three eventually decide keep the money and cover up the death after drawing of straws the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as make it unidentifiable and burying it falls david who had been the most reluctant partake in the scheme from the beginning all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the and part of what makes shallow grave so brilliant for while is that honestly had no idea what was coming next other than the obvious question of why they do not report the death and simply hide the cash is not addressed the plotting and characterization while sometimes predictable worked in way that kept my attention and on more than one occasion gave me chills will therefore attempt continue this review in way that does not give away too much of the plot broadly the trio are in danger due hugos underworld connections as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process police inspector ken stott is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment asking pointed questions and trying unnerve the three suspects exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue junior detective david meanwhile becomes increasingly paranoid moves into the attic and develops an affinity for sharp objects director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment and finally the three seem ready turn against each other while do not consider myself the happy endings are automatically stupid type thought that shallow grave really should have ended in tragedy realistic analysis of the story up the last ten minutes of the would indicate that all three characters were probably about end up in prison in the mental hospital or in the morgue this could have been accomplished quite credibly but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem flinch and opt for more conventional caper ending in we get kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom and nothing more granted this is not really happy ending but it is still pretty lighthearted compared what preceded it really should not say anything more about the ending as far as details go but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent the rest of the and not very believable yes this ending made me crack smile for couple of minutes but ultimately it left me feeling as if would been cheated still shallow grave was brilliant most of the way through and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller and am therefore awarding it three stars guess just cannot help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away,1.0
since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they are portraying it is fitting say that beloved come as real shock as it is confusing bizarre and as tough watch as any have seen all year and that is not necessarily because of the threehour running time beloved is challenging watch filled tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard and instead of straightforward hollywoodized story about what happened the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off as cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon this is based beloved tells the story of an exslave named sethe played oprah winfrey who lives on large farm in the north her children when the opens her house is being terrorized poltergeist shakes things up wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family sethe is proud though and will not move her sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone the ghost is there without any factual explanation couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day man named paul danny glover another exslave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on plantation together arrives asking for lodging he has been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turns red and becomes incredibly hot when he remarks about what he thinks is evil sethe replies it as not evil it is just sad some more time passes and paul has become fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears but when they return one day from going out they discover young woman sitting in the house her name is beloved and as played thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills she stumbles around halfgrabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk they let her into her house and she begins turn things upside down beloved acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired ghost story most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic lowlit room the occasional flash the past where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modernday psychoanalysts sethe and paul have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation includes such images as sethe being raped the white plantation hands her nipples being licked prompting her cry out paul when reminiscing about it they took my milk worst of all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed live like free person working other blacks on farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived presumedly take her and her children back she runs the barn near carrying her four children and when her old owners burst in they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready murder the rest of them if they do not leave them alone when she is inquired about this moment paul in moment halfway through the she says she does not regret it she killed her daughter so that she would not have live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing of course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we are not flat out told that until later on in the beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them deal their freedom after being tortured for so long thus beloved becomes sortaredux of the andrei tarkofsky scifi classic solaris where cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when he is orbiting over planet complex brain system that spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back haunt us it would control us completely beloved moves along freely without lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable the most interesting films are the ones that do not explain everything for us leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed fill in how they act in the present tense sethe is never fully explained as character but we understand all her actions since she is being played oprah winfrey it is been well over decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two films will bet she is one of the best actresses working today if she was strictly an actress her talk show suppose is great entity has prevented her from becoming noteworthy actress and that is shame because she brings so much this movie emotion sadness strength watching the strong sethe who is so afraid of the past that she is built rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great she makes it real that is not say this is perfect in fact would wager say that the fact that it is confusing and painful watch is what prevents this from being the truly great it is while oprahs performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and am dying see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the does not show what happened her children till halfway through the prevents us from really making cohesive connection the it does not necessarily move as though they are memories of one particular character and the end it has lost control over sethe and as she takes bed we are unable truly identify her anymore but despite its tediousness perhaps that is the point the distancing the end of the may be just part of the way it has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and it needs get back reality and for the most part this seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants be jonathan demmes direction is bizarre in nature the story and he creates the right mood making it tough sit through making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters there is more admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open more pain and suffering but laced touch of optimism the acting not only from winfrey is amazing and anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination everyone has been raving about thandie newtons performance and how it should be rewarded however it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part act like baby throw things stumble around chew food your mouth open do think there is another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but it is kimberly elise as the daugher who has stay sensible and sane and has carry the burden of her mothers loss of reality towards the end it is not that newton is not great she is as annoying and wacky as the role demands it is just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better despite the fact that this has winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved has still not done well costing think around ninety million dollars it has since grossed about twentytwo unfortunately this is little too intense for viewers even for me and can stand almost anything recently viewed the hour long epic caligula the worst have ever seen in my life and did it in mere sittings although respect beloved cannot say that really enjoyed it,1.0
usually movie is about something more than soiled rug but not the big lebowski the new offering from the creators of critical hit fargo is say the least wildly entertaining originality has always been strong trait in the coen brothers movies and the big lebowski is insanely original it begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston who is wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town two goons out collect on bunnys debt break into dudes house they attempt collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug the next day dude explains his situation his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively he is advised go the big lebowski and get him pay for the defiled rug he does this and shortly after gets tied up in kidnapping caper this is extremely funny movie lots of belly laugh moments the coen brothers have assembled great cast that play off each other perfectly also several great supporting roles john turturro as child molesting bowler named jesus the coens script plays off perfectly and it all goes together make it extremely entertaining doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one try its little different,1.0
the opening scene of young couple in van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll actually it is lock and load you cannot help thinking tarantino and of course its storyline of crazy girl and boy in love who turn violent bank robbery the unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde natural born killers but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon inspired true events we have heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated or so strangely poignant for this is story of real people whose lives take on steadily unreal quality who in their search for normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged beginning their final arrest the goes back trace the relationship between chris luke perry policeman and pam ashley judd factory worker they fall in love and marry but pams increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself knife after an argument begin trouble the solid and stable chris when chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up then chris begins rob banks luke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills or buffy the vampire slayer moustached tough paternal look and yet voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband it is another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises the challenge great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into fascinating yet often infuriating person if the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually staple of cinema whether it is in betty blue tom viv or georgia as in those movies there is the danger that the performance seems mannered collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece judd does not entirely avoid this pitfall but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint the more normal chris when pam reacts her fatherinlaws death showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint of course it is the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship insanity it is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me we are real family she notes wryly it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him be such successful bank robber his wellplanned disguise as bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery huge sign on shopping mall stands out in the background buymore the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations it is not perfect some of the dialogue is touch too banal perhaps intentionally the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image only detracts from the rest of the indeed as in mcnaughtons seminal henry portrait of serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving its great strengths mcnaughton has filmed this story quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer the suburbs their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls take on sense of claustrophobic blankness in its very different way this makes for as haunting backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands while pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed his violent robberies but these are dreams defined constrained and even doomed the limitations of the normal conventional world pams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left go but the final tragic denouement the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice,1.0

playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted write script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeares works they also wanted poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare mean really who does not think of shakespeare as guy seething so much passion that he can barely write play without exploding into passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted make movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it is so rare that picture such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been smug selfimportant movie that panders diehard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this is almost universal if you have ever read play shakespeare or know anything about his life it is likely that you will find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he is delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly women and detached from lifes more serious problems debt plague etc he is commissioned write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him write play so that he can pay off his debts hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on comedy about boy named romeo and girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps radiant gwyneth paltrow young heiress set marry the financiallyoriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love her he first meets her when she pretends be man try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues act because she loves shakespeares writing so much and soon the production later becomes romeo and juliet is set be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention detail and knows its subject matter was instantly won over joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he is clearly man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense great deal of affection and care he practically overflows passion in every scene fiennes is matched paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance have seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it does not hurt that they have masterful script work stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying fend off her nurse maid director john madden does fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of lesser director am going have see the movie again am certain there are numerous references that missed in fact doubt it is possible gather everything just one viewing stoppard is master of detail you will notice familiar lines placed throughout the not as lines of play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there is also brilliant running joke in shakespeare is in constant competition christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played the openlyhomosexual rupert everett is joke in of itself proposing slightly twisted explanation marlowes mysterious death in pub there is also scene featuring wideeyed dog that is so funny that hurt myself laughing there is no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard recognize but has great role as thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrows and in humor he has some of the best oneliners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that feel like could have been more moved the end the story is moving but there are few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it is that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him in the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it is also movie that has the potential introduce lot of people shakespeares work in positive way without seeming condescending or superior admire this not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any can poke fun at shakespeare and get away it,1.0
titantic writer and director james camerons much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the is worth it as business proposition it seems hard see how it can ever break even but as movie it is nothing short of wonderful if you have already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again the movie is both great love story told the disaster as backdrop and portrayal of one of the worlds most memorable disasters made real and personal seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers in either case it is filmmaking at its best when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the runs three and quarter hours long he said no but that the time would go so fast she would never notice the length amazingly he was right titanic is one of the few long films that does not suffer because of it the lush picture filmed russell carpenter in mm opens in the present two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the worlds most valuable diamond necklace that went down the ship known back then as the ship of dreams the necklaces hundredyearold former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock tell him her story although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk using computer simulation the movie takes the time explain what will happen later adds immensely making lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing after twenty minutes the story makes its jump the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage in classic movie theme the two parts of the ship first class and steerage thirdclass exist in sharp contrast the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing entering the ship on its day out is rose along her millionaire fiance cal hockley played perfect snobbishness billy zane and thanks last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into little shared cabin in third class even her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what an upcoming marriage man she loathes in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start brief but impassioned love affair never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power sweep the audience into the story leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack confidence and charisma in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach the part when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cals supercilious putdowns kate winslet gives wonderfully captivating performance as young rose the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for what is eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing from the scene where he embarrasses her repeatedly asking if she loves her finace the beautiful one of them hanging off the ships bow the one where she embarrasses him asking him paint her nude they dazzle the screen pair of mesmerizing performances if the breaks after an hour and half is how long cameron wisely waits have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year peter lamonts sets are more than authentic one scene for example starts the planningtoretire captain played insouciance bernard hill having his tea on deck it then shifts the ships massive gears and then the brighthot boiler room filled sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble palace more than an ocean liner easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle the water begins in earnest at first since the iceberg tears series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else what lark we have struck an iceberg now let us get back our brandy and cigars the ships musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in after all they see it as their duty calm the passengers when the musicians are about die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able play together and they mean it their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface there are more than enough characters love and hate and all of the casting is deadon special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable in titanic for he created ninetenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs the most dramatic moment in the happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water people are flung like ants either into the water be shortly frozen death or into other parts of the ship be crushed immediately besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor from the many deliciously subtle verbal putdowns the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose spit like man the show elicits laughter in addition perhaps few tears it is goodbye for little while less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first this boats for mommies and children therell be boat in little while for daddies basically there was design decision have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise perhaps the sinking is best summarized one of the guggenheims onboard the ship in the dining room the lifeboats gone and the ship certain sink he is offered life jacket one of the crew no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies we are dressed in our best and would prefer go down like gentlemen but we would like brandy titanic runs it is rated pg for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up,1.0

i remember making pact right after patch adams not be easily be suckered movies dripping sentimentality but darn it music of the heart is just layered feelgood material and bright characterizations it is hard dislike movie that uses such skill it is manipulation in addition it is also terrific family this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board keep the musical program active in handful of inner city harlem schools it could also be described as mrs streeps opus yes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad out of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult identify robertas character and grasp her academic pointofview she is very strict her students but what insight does that create into the story slowly but surely we begin recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies the unlikely presence in the directors chair horror veteran wes craven after leaving an impression the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street craven has attempted precarious crossover drama at first his inexperience the genre is fairly obvious but as the progresses craven finds surprisingly comfortable niche directing this material it does not carry the heartwarming courage of mr hollands opus but music of the heart is casually assured and filled little morsels of dramatic truth the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate yes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but it is the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially does not hire roberta because of her lack of experience blueeyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing new love interest gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of supportive secondgrade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce flaming fireball of estrogenic force it is like schoolteachers version of thelma and louise in restrained but effective manner the movie tackles more issues than just guasparis teaching of violin there is some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman in it is dramatic buildup the movie manages produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth it is good movie for anyone see although missing out on the experience would not be lifealtering decision it is commendable of wes craven be attempting such difficult crossover and also for achieving his intricate goal watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed scream of course when the third installment of that series comes around in february craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed music of the heart mission accomplished wes thankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the in it is entirety it is wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile the child actors are cute and perform up par even if some of their problems are clich and predictable in the extreme the mother who does not want her son be learning white mans music the unexpected casuality basically everything is there it does not strike the perfect chord but music of the heart is highly convincing the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but music of the heart is still edifying enough properly divulge her morals,1.0

the premise of the new teentargeted horror final destination causes recollection of memorable simpsons halloween episode after attempting repair malfunctioning toaster lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created portable timemachine after trek into the cretaceous period homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world again and again homer toys the master plan and pays dearly for it the characters of final destination have also tampered the blueprint schematics of their existence their design someone is after them the strict intent of correcting the mistake that someone is death you see alex browning devon sawa and six others have cheated the grim reaper but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve for high school excursion alexs french class is traveling paris airline transport alex tense and neurotic has shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in midair in panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft after handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize but death will not be cheated so easily and one one the survivors of flight are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi before delve into the meat of the review would just like confer is that one helluva premise or what final destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong on familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening minutes of final destination reflects that unlike most thrillers the setup is crisp and cool you just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum will not unspool leaving us secondstring effort nothing but cheap derivative shocks young viewers have palpable reason expect this kind of formula deterioration what i know what you did last summer and sequel idle hands and movie nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend after the setup when remained slouched apprehensively in my chair started really have fun final destination low and behold teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent some splotty logic and heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies submerge since the cuttingedge scream in final destination stimulates the nerves and offers exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap we have endured throughout the past few years not that the characters are that good sawa is game as alex connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend in addition the survivors are endearing geek

identify the main characters plight toss few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and ummm spiritual mortician former candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments not so final destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murdererontheloose concept assistance from shrewd intelligently paced screenplay morgan wong and jeffrey reddick the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games but suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes creative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading characters demise what will trigger the accident will it be the john denver record just put on play rocky mountain high yeah sick humor will it be the leaking toilet the falling fishing reel in the corner the murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly minute afterward sense of giddy unpredictability is added this inventive approach it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares it is fun in that simple regard final destination is my cup of tea this stylishly executed thriller although tagged laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt the dark side after the show it will also have an frightening impact on you when will your design expire is death waiting around

it is easy see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his i artificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted the material for here we have another lost boy trying find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielbergs body of work from sugarland express close encounters of the third kind t empire of the sun hook saving private ryan naming just few examples i is set in an undefined near future in giant technological advances have led the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping fulfilling sexual fantasies it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and the number of births limited the government many couples are yearning for children and professor hobby william hurt has the solution robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed love as test david is placed henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances oconnor their naturalborn son has been cryogenically frozen until cure can be found for his illness the first third of i deals davids life the swintons and how that is changed the recovery and return of their son martin circumstances force david be cut off from the swintons he is abandoned and alone david highly influenced the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes real boy he can rekindle monicas love for him the films second act follows davids search for the blue fairy whom he believes will be able fulfill his wish during these adventures he meets and is helped gigolo joe jude law robot who specializes in sex spielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers here is where kubricks influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots the savagery conjures up images from the late directors clockwork orange at about two hours and minutes the begins falter during the last minutes sequence that seems most spielbergian images that appear be borrowed from close encounters it is all very anticlimatic and jarring these scenes seem almost superfluous as if from different i is dark fairy tale that deserves its pg rating it is story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images but i is really showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings sense of joy and wonder the role of david being created for the express purpose of loving he shines when monica beaming love as eager as puppy please after being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective become real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mothers eyes law is pleasant as the carefree robot who really does not understand davids quest but is nonetheless happy help him on his journey probably the toughest role is oconnors monica playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins perceive david not as second chance but as threat her family she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action many of i futuristic sets are breathtaking especially mostly submerged new york lost the world the melting of the polar ice caps i is flawed and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera would it have been darker more cynical we will never know we can only judge what is before us on the screen collaboration of two cinematic giants i is most interesting and thoughtprovoking examination of future that is quickly gaining on us,1.0
heres word analogy amistad is the lost world as schindlers list is jurassic park in after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindlers list as the directors penance as if there was need for him apologize for making crowdpleasing blockbuster now after threeyear layoff spielberg is back vengeance once again his summer release was special effectsloaded actionadventure flick dinosaurs munching on human appetizers now following his pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity that is amistad although not as masterful as schindlers list amistad is nevertheless gripping motion picture thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls little short is in its emotional impact watching schindlers list was powerful almost spiritual experience spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered threeplus hours later aspects of the movie have stayed me ever since amistad while fine example of making is not as transcendent the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts that is not surprise however the event is part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously the actual account most of the basic facts are in order several mostly minor changes have been made enhance the films dramatic force on the whole while amistad may not be faithful all of the details of the situation it is true the spirit and meaning of what transpired one stormy night during the summer of the men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape led the lionhearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how make their way back africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards navigate the eastward journey they are tricked however and the la amistad makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline is eventually captured an american naval ship near connecticut the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged murder and piracy the first men come the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard they are soon joined roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey property attorney of little repute aided advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge but powerful forces have aligned against baldwins cause current president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager please southern voters and year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behindthescenes ensure that none of the africans goes free at its heart amistad is tale of human courage cinque is heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected he is free man not slave and while he recognizes that he may die as result of his struggle he will not give it up effectively portrayed newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in battle of ideologies they are individuals and our ability make that distinction is crucial the movies success amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans pointofview detailing their occasionallyhumorous observations about some of the white mans seeminglystrange rituals the larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as subhuman so the proslavery forces of amistad use similar defense the abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property in sense the morality of slavery is on trial here the specter of civil war would break out less than three decades later looming over everything amistads presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history four claimants come forward against the africans the state wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over her under the provision of an americanspanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned them baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing challenge his own preconceived notions as the result of relationship he develops cinque even though attorney and client are divided language barrier they gradually learn communicate aside from cinque who is fullyrealized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is topnotch matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly welldefined outside of his role in the la amistad case likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as spineless sycophant whom justice means far less than winning an election finally there is anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as serial killer an emotionallycrippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams his tenminute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindlers list is this films lack of welldefined human villain schindlers list had ralph fiennes superblyrealized amon goeth who was not only threedimensional character but personification of all that the nazis stood for there is no such figure in amistad the villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary it is spielbergs credit that he has fashioned such compelling motion picture without prominent antagonist amistads trek the screen encountered some choppy waters author barbara chaseriboud has cried plagiarism charge denied the makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves it remains be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain spielbergs rousing substantive leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history,1.0

once again the battle is dreamworks versus disney earlier this year the mammoth companies fought the death their endoftheworld asteroid flicks deep impact and armageddon here we are now just few months later and they are at it again dueling bug movies antz and bugs life what find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution mean come on what were the chances of two studios both deciding bring out computeranimated films about bugs as was the case the meteor movies disney has come out on top though antz is likable movie bugs life is far superior in fact this movie made me realize what was wrong antz became immersed in the world of bugs life while antz just made me scrutinize everything but it is not really fair base an entire review on comparison bugs life is remarkable in its own right and deserves be seen apart from any other computeranimated about bugs in fact it is one of the best films this year it is smart subtle and funny but it is also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining have not had such good time at the movies in months it tells the story of an ant named flick voice dave foley he is nice guy but he is also troublemaker the ants spend all season putting together the offering big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers just before the grasshoppers come flick accidentally knocks over the offering and ruins everything for the entire colony the grasshoppers leader hopper kevin spacey is enraged and tells them that the ants need twice the food the end of summer or they are all dead flick feeling responsible for this sets off look for help he realizes that the only way be rid of the grasshoppers is fight them he heads the city the city being house few miles away where he finds colorful bunch of circus bugs ladybug denis leary who is spectacular black widow bonnie hunt caterpillar joe ranft butterfly madeline kahn rhinoceros beetle michael mcshane and stick david hydepierce also giving hilarious performance flick does not know they are actors and they do not know that flick needs them kill bunch of grasshoppers so they return the colony flick and find themselves in an unusual position the most obvious element of bugs life is the quality of animation created pixar the same people who brought us toy story bugs life has some of the most amazing visuals have ever seen the bugs seem inhabit threedimensional space and occasionally there will be shot that is indistinguishable from live action this is lush colorful world full of life and imagination the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives matches bottlecaps tin cans etc and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative the is also mercilessly exciting particularly in superblystaged scene involving our heroes escape from bird little bird never seemed so huge and threatening but the makers of bugs life know where the importance lies story and characters flick solid voice work from foley is great guy lead the story but the real treat comes the circus bugs they are such likable group of characters the standouts are the stick hydepierce is so good francis the ladybug and the big fat caterpillar all of these bugs have more than token personality makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs and it also keeps the tearjerking scenes from seeming obligatory in my review of antz said that the is clever copout because it presents bunch of little humans reacting an antlike existence in concept bugs life is basically the same movie except that was never given enough time find things that did not like about it such strong work in both animation and script bugs life is nothing but joy sit through it really is too bad that it had come out so close that other bug movie but bugs life is so good that am sure it will find its audience after slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies it is downright refreshing sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty,1.0

what is shocking about carlitos way is how good it is having gotten bit of bad rap for not being big box office hit like pacinos previous scent of woman and not having as strong performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlitos way was destined for underrated heaven that is what it is an underrated gem of movie and what shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs it and turn it into great piece of pulpy character study carlitos way deals well carlito brigante pacino puerto rican exdrug kingpin who gets out of long jailterm when his cokeaddicted curlyhaired lawyer sean penn points out legal technicality of course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided go straight even if he is really crook at heart carlito like barry lyndon is man who is trapped fate at every turn and cannot escape into something he is not carlitos attempts at clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn when he first gets out friend of his ends up leading him into big shootout where he has kill couple people survive he is constantly getting bugged the government see if he is doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neckdeep in pile of shit needing him try and help him out includes him doing some prison breaking carlito like ratso rizzo wants go miami since according logic that is where it is at but needs some funding being legend he is quickly able get nice job running big dance club this is the the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get hear all sorts of classics including several c and the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite he gets bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running pretty good business even if he is constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out be young version of carlito on the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened her his girlfriend from before prison she is goregeous ballerina and stripper and soon carlito is trying get back her and take her him when he finally leaves for miami while this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has track her down all of these elements clash together at the end in brilliantly executed emotional climax is inevitable when say inevitable mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting great spin on it sure it is going eleveate some of the tension but it gives the lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped fate what is amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done de palma has lot of tension and thrills like apollo we know what is going happen but we are still thrilled what happens in the middle it is also very emotional thanks great script david koepp and amazing performances pacino and miller de palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films his earlier flim scarface starred pacino in the lead has ton of it especially at the end and nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning am still not over but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes me the best scene in the is when carlito is on top of building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet this is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire and probably the best in de palma history gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto trashcan lid covering carlitos head and saddened remorseful look on pacinos face it is tearjerker well for me dunno about you the acting from all is great especially from the three leads pacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent was not puerto rican enough and well it was not as strong as his oscarwinning role in scent of woman well his scent of woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said foghorn leghorn impression in carlitos way he is emotional and strong despite the fact that he is remorseful over his entire lifestyle he cannot change felt more for carlito brigante than did for the tangodancing insultthrowing blind guy in scent of woman as said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry and they are scenes are wellwritten some good clever dialogue adds some interest an otherwise bland relationship and sean penn is amazing as the cokeaddicted rat attorney every scene he is in he has great energy and even measures up the greatness that is pacino in smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlitos way is one of those films you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you are absolutely blown away it is wonderful highly underrated little masterpiece was shelved after it did not do so hot but trust me and check it out it is great little and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right,1.0

naturally at the core of leon gasts when we were kings is the fight itself for what fight it was thanks the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman fans were treated an round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore the benefit of the firsthand recollections of that old expug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back life but when we were kings tackles issues that are harder pin down than the simple facts of boxing match questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary gast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gasts forceful swipe at the united states when ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind his decision buck the draft for vietnam is defended the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons despite showcasing alis proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion listening the films numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on map spike lee tells us that the event was pilgrimage coming home africa foreman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation fair enough but this homeland is specific nation cursed less than inspiring reality it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled president mobutu brutal dictator while ali respects mobutus ability forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in the titans battled lay hidden the presidents wellstocked torture chambers mailers insights are lost on most of the films commentators george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire squalid ruling elite mobutu is not the only dubious character benefit from the heady symbolism of black power don king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease the messiah label attributed him loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of new black international solidarity understandably foreman believes he has gotten raw deal he may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king africa zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of black unity little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked find that alis opponent was not white admittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time there is just too much cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for protracted political analysis be justified the excitement of james brown and b king in concert for instance and of course there is always ali consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gonna get it on coz we do not get along doubtlessly considering the multifaceted nature of the extravaganza they chose cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention fortunately refusing simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event,1.0

scream has titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during filmclass discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up the originals few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans included almost every teenager in america sequel was unavoidable but luckily the reteaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious all the adorning fans of scream would say that scream might even be the better sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first has since written book about the dreadful events book titled stab has been developed into major motion picture as scream opens crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long young couple are butchered death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out repeat what is been done and finish what has not of course the killer is just as obsessed movies as the killer in the first and yes movies play huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as heshe goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due williamsons deliciously written script will easily leave you satisfied as much as the condemns the use of cliches it is riddled them but it is done so effectively and skillful direction craven that you are not bound complain will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person suspected but believe me kept changing my mind as tried stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we are not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true their roots and yet show clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first has affected them but we do not lose any of the luster that made them such delight watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it does not seem offkilter from it is predecessor it is natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from we skip two years but there does not seem be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you are reading chapter two of book long chapters eh than just revitalizing cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream entire plot structure correlates completely the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as said before scream easily lives up if not surpassing it is precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this does not mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it is sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it is own while maintaining it is soughtafter qualities if ever followed it is original so well it would be scream and it makes this definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it were not for the fact that two movies do not really make series it is unlikely assume that scream will not appear in the next few years but if they do decide turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horrortrilogy let us hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say do not mess perfection but when moneymaking smashhit is almost guaranteed who is gonna listen,1.0

for gurgi the trade is made gurgis seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group as taran cradles him in his arms though gurgi stirshe is not dead after all the happy group then returns home where hen wen brought home the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return as spectacular as it sounds the black cauldron really suffered lot in its past times before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions he had bought novel lloyd alexander called the black cauldron sword and sorcery tale for the studio bringing this book the screen was the studios fondest dream miller who entitled himself as the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio the animators were struggling complete the black cauldron this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department many of the studios old men had retired or died therefore the animators suffered hard time making this originally budgeted at million the costs raised million because of constant changes on everything and when it was finally released on june the black cauldron was greeted praising reviews from some critics but somehow the flopped the was rated pg and the although disneyfied from lloyd alexanders chronicles of prydain is what this is based on was much more scarier and darker than disneys other previous efforts such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it in addition other critics rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable compared other disney animated features but whatever the real reason the black cauldron was financial disaster grossing only million the failure of the grounded the studios animation department and exiled the animation team annex buildings in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated features would no longer become part of the studios reputation the next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although little more lighthearted than the black cauldron did not do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective only the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features as for the black cauldron it was rereleased in some cities for temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron finally the studio locked the in the vault and denied that it ever even was released because of all this you might ask yourself was the black cauldron really such bad movie the people who had seen the did not think so in fact many people had calls buena vista home video requesting for the but of course they denied it for while it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released video until september disney released the black cauldron video in the united kingdom few people imported the video from england and converted ntsc including me and for those who had not seen the yet am included here they got quite treat but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors about seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the would get u rating in the uk the rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version of somewhere online team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because of that disney finally decided release the video the united states before that time rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get g rating and that they would add in songs those rumors were put rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would be released in its pg rated version even still when it was finally released the us some reaction was mixed some felt that it was indeed cut but some felt that it was not but these where only minor criticisms seemed laughable since that was absent for thirteen years was finally available as for myself when saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video did not expect much at all in fact had heard so many mediocre things about it that did not think the would ever be such good much my surprise when saw the first few minutes of the was asking myself this is the same everyone saw the one that flopped at the box office the one that critics and filmgoers alike called bad movie this does not seem like all of the above instead it is classic in its own right the has wonderful cast of characters there is taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be warrior than pigkeeper the storys hero the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true he is brave loyal and eventually learns lesson about friendship later on there is likeable character here not that he is the only likeable character in the there is gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing who remains loyal taran even though they do not quite hit it off at first but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal the films imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet he also fears his neck the other characters including the sidekicks spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide dark secret although pleasant and likeable are not quite as well rounded as they should be the story itself is an adventurous one quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and an army of deathless ones everything hooking opening spectacular finale elmer bernsteins music also tells the story perfectly in dark yet calming manner the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this was created in the darkest time of the studios even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth the animation overall is top notch overall this is an entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get kick out of this one except young kids there are some extremely scary scenes are more darker than disneys other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary is the main reason why this is rated pg fans familiar the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie even though it does not have all of the ingredients of true disney this is classic in its own right and deserves far better chance than what it has been given that better chance has finally come whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such big failure seems have disappeared and the has finally achieved its place among disneys most proudest achievements cannot help but think though whatever would have happened if the black cauldron was box office success,1.0

in october of the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when spy plane flyovers of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles miles from the us president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldsons dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days one of the highlights come out of madefortv movies was entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in now quarter of century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out reenact the events of that most dangerous time in americas and the worlds history taken from the viewpoint of special assistant the president kenneth odonnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war as odonnell gets ready head work one october morning he deals the usual family crises and problems meanwhile u spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment suddenly kens routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin muster the considerable forces of the us military face the soviet threat where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project there is big difference budgetwise between making television docudrama and one that goes the big screen it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation the cast true ensemble is led surprisingly bruce greenwood as jfk and not kevin costner costners odonnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family this puts personal spin on the as we see both the crisis and americas preparation for war and the pressure it brings bear on those in the know kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes head his family will be no more the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though this is where the stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels the story does not just cover the faceoff between the worlds two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the militarycia the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro the missile crisis becomes struggle for power as the armynavyair force want flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants end the confrontation peaceably but americas dignity and world leadership intact while the internal battle for power rages in the white house air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion stop the soviets blockade of offensive weapons cuba this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced exciting action when the first confrontation takes place between us warship and soviet freighter the tension is palpable the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another is sent up shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an antiaircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane this is sweaty palm sequence say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try help the pilot avoid those missiles the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals like weight given all the principle players greenwood does not play act at being caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent instead he plays the man as powerful figure who has maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude make clear all of his options kennedy used this decision committee method good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available the president costner as ken odonnell is really supporting cast member as kennedy crony brought on board as personal political favor costner plays odonnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches forced kennedyesque twang his speech the rest of the players are first rate from start finish steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador the un adlai stevenson who was forced become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and remember the confrontation vividly the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down stevenson accuracy using old style video footage good effect dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them hell attitude also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of

true faith and its expression through organized religion is difficult subject for motion picture tackle headon is probably why so few of them do it even the most religious directors like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms so it is not hard see why it took robert duvall fifteen years get the apostle onto the bigscreen as matter of fact even after fifteen years he still never managed get financial backing and he ended up paying for it million of his own money he also wrote the script directed the and starred as the central character fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity take on that kind of financial technical and creative responsibility singlehandedly and it is testament what an intensely personal project this was for duvall and thankfully every bit of that personal investment translates onscreen into power and honest emotion sonny is an energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since he was twelve he spends much of his time traveling about the country evangelizing other preachers at tent revivals unlike most characterizations of intense preachers sonny is not phony or swindler and the films purpose is not unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says although like all humans he has weaknesses one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that not only does his longsuffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want leave him for another man in the congregation but the two of them have secretly plotted remove him as preacher faced the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into violent temper at his sons baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wifes lover in the face baseball bat inflicting wound that may be fatal not knowing what else do sonny disappears he throws away his identification drives his car into lake and takes bus louisiana hoping start over again in the tiny mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling after befriending simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the towns exminister john beasley sonny sets up his own church the one way heaven temple rechristening himself as the apostle f he quickly draws together an eager congregation and together they realize real change in each others lives but always sonnys past is lurking step behind him waiting swallow his progress duvall has made his intentions in making the apostle clear in recent article in newsweek he wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality such strong emphasis on the holy spirit and when they do it tends be patronizing full of charlatans and snake handlers but what really wanted do was try understand what these preachers go through and what they believe and portray it in an accurate way the strength of duvalls convictions turn out be the strength of his the apostle always rings true even in the most painful moments because we know he is being sincere the subject matter after fifteen years of traveling the country listening all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means be truly spiritual his sonny is man who speaks directly god and expects be spoken right back have always called you jesus and you have always called me sonny he says when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants the man upstairs sonnys mother june carter cash just hangs up on them because she knows there is no sense trying interrupt him the main theme emerge from the apostle is the fact that good can come from any situation sonnys act of violence toward another human being is inarguably horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact however that very same act of violence is what brings sonny bayou boutte where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him in his short time in louisiana he does world of good and when the police finally show up take him away he goes quietly knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him and as scene during the final credits shows he even turns his punishment into positive opportunity for change and betterment it is that strength in sonnys character that makes him so appealing and magnetic others he is flawed but he is powerful enough overcome those flaws weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire better themselves watching duvall onscreen it is not hard imagine that he would have been magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting as sonny he completely inhabits the character and his performance is certainly the best of the year because he spent so much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities of real preachers duvall was able create complete character who always feels indelibly human as director duvall feels that less is more his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it very little intrusion there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups duvall knew that the power of the films characters enhanced the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers did not need be artificially enhanced in this way the apostle almost plays out like documentary not only in its technical simplicity but more importantly in its sense of reality,1.0

in these days of overlong movies meet joe black the thin red line the mask of zorro it is shame that films like waking ned devine cannot be longer than paltry minutes this is just cute movie even through its mildly risque subject matter old friends jackie bannen and michael kelley try find the lottery winner they deduce must live in their dinky town of about so that they might kiss up him and share the winnings through process of elimination they find that it must be lovable old ned devine who they find sitting in front of his tv clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand what results is thuroughly amusing as jackie tries convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong and that they could really benefit after all old ned will not miss it rather than divulge the later twists and turns will stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage bannen and kelly are perfect pair one slightly stout the other as thin as rail both getting on in years they make such cute pair of old codgers waking ned devine may even be seen as full monty for the geriatric set especially since kelly gets buffo for one amusing scene waking ned devine is no means perfect but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films the performances everyone in the town are great particularly the two leads there is one twist at the end find unnecessary but it hardly ruins the picture writerdirector kirk jones should be held up as an example all those screenwriters scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm not the exception perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful even more had held off on my years bestworst list for another day waking ned devine officially released in late november of surely would have graced the short group of the years finest films it is light but thought provoking and sweet cannot think of anyone who should not see or would not enjoy this,1.0
dark city is such rare treat it a stunning hyperkinetic vision of place where our reality is fused noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london boot it is accompanied an intense well written and thoughtful story movies of this caliber and idea aren made too often and it unfortunate that waited this long see it alex proyas who previous the crow looked good but couldn cover up the terrible acting or story here shows near masterpiece combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly at times it moves beyond into artwork it is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the who experiment on humans discover what makes them live what makes up our soul these aliens are superior humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter their mind called tuning they are aided human scientist played kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight during this time john murdoch played swiftly rufus sewell wakes in bathtub in room swinging overhead light terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience without memory and strange guilt that he may be killer he receives phone call flee as the strangers are after him don want proceed much further the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the is watching it develop in way regaining murdoch identity along him it a pleasure watch the characters develop through the cinematography murdoch wife anna is introduced through stunning beam of light she is lounge singer who sings into bright spotlight shadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine we see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings slow rhythmic song great entrance however such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough leave the viewer satisfied the city is nice look at but if it a poor story then it not worth watching blade runner was popular not only because it visuals but it story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience it is discussed it and argued therefore success other science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy we re left love conquers all after finishing the fifth element dark city is not so easily explained away as the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task where is reality dark city is certainly the best science fiction of the and ranks along the best made in the such as blade runner and the two aliens films perhaps it the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond think because the themes behind it were much stronger anyone who wants make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free write d love hear it,1.0
anyone who saw alan rickmans finelyrealized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actorturneddirector is bit of poet at heart however for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood prince of thieves this recognition may be something of shock nevertheless poetic is an excellent term describe rickmans feature debut as director the winter guest the has simple unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements fashion successful whole the result is an occasionally haunting sometimes magical and always insightful human drama the winter guest is not about resolving plot threads and advancing story line it is about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages the winter guest does not tell traditional tale nor does it ascribe conventional narrative structure there is no real beginning or end instead we are given an opportunity observe one day in the lives of eight humans they represent both sexes multiple generations and variety of relationships male and female young middleaged and elderly friends wouldbe lovers and kin we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed emotional boundaries eroded and truths unveiled there is comedy and tragedy most importantly much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives in this fiction can be found much truth the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year it is so frigid that the sea has begun freeze over the onshore wind cuts like knife and snow blankets the beach giving the terrain an alien appearance it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the are captured there are four pairings and although there is some interaction between the different twosomes the winter guests focus is on the dynamics internal each relationship the first meatiest pairing is that of elspeth phylida law and her recentlywidowed daughter frances emma thompson these two have stormy relationship they love each other deeply but both are stubborn and willful and neither is willing admit that they need the other much of their interaction is argumentative but during the course of long walk the frozen shoreline they come an unspoken understanding of how much each means the other frances adult son alex gary is lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father on this day he meets girl nita arlene cockburn who has secretly been spying on him for weeks although their first encounter is antagonistic she throws snowball at him both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction once they retire place where they can be alone however things do not go exactly as planned lily sheila reid and chloe sandra voe are couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees death is topic of endless fascination for them perhaps because they are so close it and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area it does not matter whether or not they knew the deceased it is the ceremony that they are interested in sam douglas murphy and tom sean biggerstaff pair of schoolboy chums are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach horsing around building small fire for warmth and walking on the frozen water unlike lily and chloe these two have their entire lives ahead of them they are young enough still believe in magic but old enough recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience the acting is strong and believable the mixture of veteran performers and firsttimers is effective the most successful choice being the casting of reallife mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles there is chemistry in their interaction that would be hard replicate two different nonrelated actors and of course the physical resemblance makes it that much easier accept elspeth and frances as parent and child the winter guest began its life as stage play in rickman as the director four of the films principals phylida law arlene cockburn sheila reid and sandra voe appeared in the theatrical version before moving the unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays the winter guest has been successfully opened up the rough bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of character as any of the eight humans in fact considering how important the climate is every relationship under rickmans microscope it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie if you appreciate character studies the winter guest is solid effort enough power stay you after you have left the theater,1.0
i want correct what wrote last year in my retrospective of david leans war picture still think that the bridge on the river kwai does not deserve being the number in the american institutes list of the greatest american movies and think that angry men witness for the prosecution and paths of glory would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of but cannot deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents the is set in burma in batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced the japanese build strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding the geneva conventions that his officers need not work as simple workmen struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa give way in this respect afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge he considers it an opportunity raise his mens morale and he wants prove superior british capabilities the japanese but the british high command sends few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins flaw of the picture is the clich characterization of the japanese people they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior the british as if the japanese were incapable of building bridge and the does not consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory lean seems rather fascinated the military hierarchies this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is presented as somehow unpleasant person the audience is supposed applaud col nicholsons perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not the spectators are supposed neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men the plot bypasses these risks that means the picture is not perfect but it has lot of virtues as well the bridge on the river kwai shows the madness of war and what it can produce in peoples minds it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed the idea of being hero and that others like shears get cynics and leans is an interesting study of characters clashing interests these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this an antiwar despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme david leans direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect his is highly suspenseful especially in its dramatic if not wholly plausible showdown the is also wellphotographed and has an apt score alec guinness does magnificent job of bringing col nicholson life and making him such an interesting character the other actors deliver fine performances as well like this extraordinary despite its weaknesses karl rackwitz klein ris germany,1.0
recently read reviews of pleasantvilleone from entertainment weekly one from newsgroup and two from different online resources each review compared this the truman show why the only reason people compared pleasantville truman is due the fact that their lives are on television other than that the two movies are completely different from each other reviewers seem love pick one movie e the truman show obsess over it and make it guideline for other movies when pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman the same goes for the thin red line as well when it opened in decemeber probably of reviews compared it stephen spielbergs saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever critics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough reach its standards this is why think pleasantville was underrated if the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after it is long been on the video store shelves sure it was not perfect and it was not very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the is cast perfectly the ice storms tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old sitcom pleasantville escape from his feuding parents his twin sister jen reese witherspoon is popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes but what makes her character believeable is the dialoguethose excessive terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit she is supposed be the twins little help from tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously cameoesque cast rather than true acting one are sucked into pleasantville magical new remote their new parents played william macy and joan allen are perfect in every way their new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start corrupt the town of pleasantville after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins take form it is just like watching sitcom in itself you do not want it end mary sue has sex her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start take color soon we learn that these people do not know how express true emotions and when they learn do so they eventually turn into color this eventually sparks racial war between the coloreds and the black whites entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show yes the truman show was maybe little more intelligent but the racial settingintensified the forcing of the coloreds sit in the upper box of the courtroomcertainly classifies as deep considering it is what least expected gary ross did not try create an intelligent award masterpiecehe just tries convey moral messages within his work take for example big and dave his past films bigbe careful what you wish for davegood or bad lying is still lying did these movies win big awards no but they won the heart of millions pleasantville could have done that too if it was not for snotty reviewers who set precedents preceeding films pleasantville adam almost lost my nose and like it like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown,1.0
note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned the teaser trailers for my best friends wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more would frankly rarely seen trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often it was then both my surprise and my delight find that my best friends wedding was such success strong bouyant romanticcomedy some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring triumphant performance from ms roberts the heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter julia roberts successful new york restaurant critic and we open the whimsical revelation her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made pact her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal dermot mulroney sports writer that if they both had not married the time they reached they had promised marry each other both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michaels age julianne realizes that he is mere weeks away from his th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives phone call from michael later that day however she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards his impending marriage heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne fly down chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves break up the wedding and steal the groom any means necessary the setup for my best friends wedding then is fairly conventional one and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic but only certain extent the was directed j hogan whose first feature muriels wedding had quite an offbeat tone for traditional uplifting uglyduckling story and the same holds true for my best friends wedding confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements really eccentric sense of humour the is innundated sly mischievousness seems clearly the influence of mr hogan for example there is heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background my best friends wedding opens an inspired opening credit sequence sets the tone for the and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song good comic effect it could almost be argued that this is nearly as much of musical as woody allens everyone says love you would even assert it is more successful one my best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality its characters as well in typical romanticcomedy kimmy would be portrayed as snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne rescue michael from her grasps this is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved utterly destroy kimmys life she would actually like her too the george character is almost staple of recent the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friends wedding he gets have playful mischievous and charming personality throughout the the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists and the result is is compelling all the way its somewhat unorthodox conclusion there is lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay ronald bass we are given four interesting vivid and likeable characters some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments my best friends wedding marks strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in topnotch confident and reassured performance as julianne this is not the sort of role one usually associates ms roberts the julianne characters neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in shining performance in my best friends weddding smile lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits false note in the she even sings will not soon forget her charming serenade of just do not know what do myself rupert everett is given very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it hilarious turn makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the his george is bit of devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everetts performance is delight watch he is clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous dermot mulroney is adequate in thankless role unlike the other characters in the he is not given lot do but there is genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic when julia roberts lustre began fade and she was usurped from her title as americas sweetheart sandra bullock thought it was canny career move on her part take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says love you raise her profile while that did not quite work out it is nearcertain that her successful return the genre made her big star back in the romanticcomedy will once again raise her ante in the game my best friends wedding marks return form for ms roberts and cements j hogans reputation as skilled director of comedy,1.0

probably the most popular and praised of all time turned out be primitive and predictable costume drama dose of social criticism everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted director james cameron combining visual and sound effects he recreates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes while their cabin is slowly filling up water mother is telling her children fairytail and they lived happily ever after and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air however the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues in the present day the rms titanic is explored brock lovett bill paxton treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond lost during the sinking somewhere inside the ship lovetts crew discover sketchbook of an artist long dead here in the shape of nude young lady is window into the distant age of lovett is extremely surprised when he gets phone call from rose dawson claiming that she is model she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in years as the memories come flooding back she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer kate winslet the fianc of wealthy cal hockley billy zane and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher on board there are rich and poor everyone trust in the ships designer jonathan hyde and her master captain j smith bernard hill on board the ship rose unhappy and restless meets jack leonardo dicaprio young american artist poor brave and attractive love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes but also face the greatest power on earth death cameron could as well have called his picture the never ending love or love at first sight as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple and not on the disaster itself the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble television soapopera the director does not even try overcome his empty script because of its primitive and predictable plot titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking russel carpenters rich majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly awardworthy everything from art direction visual and sound effects are top notch but it does not help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them the actors are not blame because their characters are more like caricatures in other words fake jack is man many talents he is talented artist handsome brave honest strong funny you name it he does not have any dark side he does not make any mistakes that for second would make him human jack is perfect but he is poor on the other hand we have cal he is bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wifetobe he lacks everything jack possesses but he is rich this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than mediocre picture cameron knows precisely what we want see his therefore contains certain minimums draw an audience attractive actors tragic love story beautiful visuals including expensive special effects dose of social criticism fascinating historical event we love true stories and last but not least an incredible media support proclaimed an average picture the greatest of all time on the outside titanic looks perfect but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals is emptiness nothing think about the main weakness of this ironically became its success is simplicity cameron enables our basic and if you wish primitive emotions love hate fear and helplessness everyone understands the power of love and the threat our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable sinking ship titanic is typical production totally and completely dependent on visual perfection hide its primitive plot it is good picture but absolutely not masterpiece it is among hundreds and thousands good films released every year not better or worse than the average american,1.0
cinema has been around for about hundred years now it is not my job recap this century every time talk about new but would like think that am beginning understand the art more as watch more films from before my time recently have seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely be remembered for well quite while like this too yes it is disasterslashaction movie true its budget is lot more money than will ever see in my lifetime and there is not doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was make lot of money in fact bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards lousy had they thought it would have been more profitable certainly do not care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such skilled director that doubt he would ever make that is difficult sit through of course skillful direction does not complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages keep everything together the story is wellthought out and perfectly paced provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about if you do not like this then you have problem the genre itself armageddon is as good as like this can be if you have seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the so it is up the s government stop it why the s is always exclusively saddled these problems is never fully investigated their plan send group of experienced oil drillers up the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate nuclear warhead within the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis his group of men is colorful bunch including j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there is also an interesting triangle formed between j harry and grace liv tyler who is harrys daughter j and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad is not too happy the situation it is absurd wish for complicated story in an event movie or special effects movie or whatever it is you would like call armageddon it is not about story it is about viscera and action and thrillsaminute and all that stuff it is incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions give two seconds thought what actually happens but bay is the one congratulate in this case for he has made so entertaining and so visually sharp that doubt any director could have done it better think most of the budget went cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance in meteor shower obliterates new york meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into building sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways like his quickedit style because it is abrasive and exhausting watch it is also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times but it is fun be obnoxious sometimes the special effects in this put every other blockbuster shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and offer comparison between the quality of this and godzilla is simply laughable special effects are very important in like this if they are not good then the image is not convincing and the does not work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that do not look totally real are still pleasure behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art of course all of this would add up little more than an aboveaverage light show if did not get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action the is two and half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action much of the is dedicated developing the various characters subplots will not suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions are not put forth in sentimental and overbearing way in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that is lot more than can say about deep impact was banking on the feelgood parts of its story bruce willis is terrific and am glad see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on comfortable level patton who is magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the lively and funny was not challenged think real hard while watching armageddon and do not mind too much but the does not insult my intelligence it is pitched perfectly entertain is what all it really wants do it is not mindless and escapist but wellcrafted cinema it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget am not saying that

it is no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between script and the actors involved often makes or breaks movie at the box office poorlywritten script can be bested superb acting corps and wellwritten piece can be mangled group of amateurs in directing his latest actioncomedy director brett ratner money talks takes relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into funny as all getout buddy cop movie in addition rush hour serves as firstclass example of directing movie conservative attitude feature that is sure draw in crowds of all types the two lead names share equal screen time here mostly because they spend it together jackie chan in his first completely american production makes an impressive debut mixing dialogue martial arts the other martial arts flick from few weeks ago knock off stands no chance against the content of this one chan manages make every fight scene exude grace and poise and there is no doubt that large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who could not believe their eyes the first time chris tucker on the opposite side relates hilarious comedic approach smoothes out the rough edges chans performance he works perfectly the script and it is quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf hand some of his lines almost essential the action genre the plot is nonexistent we are quickly introduced detective james carter tucker is maverick officer for the lapd cut forward another scene where the daughter julia hsu of the american chinese consul tzi ma is kidnapped gang of swarthy characters the fbi is quick the rescue but the consul insists that one of his men detective inspector lee chan be brought on the case help the fbi resists but then requests that lapd send man over babysit the chinese detective it is here that carter and lee hook up and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in back them up rattner does fine job of going the extra mile get his movie move step up but it does not quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan this might be major drawback also some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride and others are there simply look menacing however none gives standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another whether it is tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences and that contributes greatly this being watchable movie for all types recommendable visit the theater indeed,1.0
when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys one of these toys is wheezy penguin broken squeaker woody tom hanks saddles up andys dog and rides out into the yard rescue wheezy woody succeeds in his mission but does not make it back the house before al the unscrupulous owner of als toy barn recognizes woody as rare collectors item and steals him buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city find their friend meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped al has collected every piece of merchandising from the tv puppet show woodys roundup except for woody doll now that the collection is complete al plans sell woody and his roundup gangbullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer toy museum in japan the gang is happy about the move they have been in storage for years waiting for woody if woody does not go them they will be closed up in dark box again possibly forever trying convince him stay them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as beloved toy are numbered while woody ponders whether go japan or go home andy buzz and the boys invade als toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced another buzz who does not know he is toy the new buzz generates the movies biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurgs fortress e als apartment building the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected grownup sensibility rather than the usual thisiswhatwethinkkidswanttohear while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he was not special that he was just like everyone else buzz sank into suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being toy was worthwhile because toy is loved and toy makes child happy in other words it is okay be ordinary if you have love and purpose in your life most of us probably come the same conclusion when we realize that we are not space rangers and we are never going be toy story addresses the question raised the conclusion drawn the first movie woody is forced recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in dark box in the attic this is another big grownup theme everything ends the theme is introduced early in the movie when woodys arm is torn and andy places him on shelf rather than taking him cowboy camp on the shelf woody meets wheezy who is dusty broken and forgotten the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woodys ride out the cent box at the yard sale is suicide attempt after he is stolen woody has decide between long life in display case and an uncertain future andy and his pals of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story explores it is also very funny most of the laughs come from the toys assault on als toy barn and on the apartment building the brief substitution of new still delusional buzz was welcome surprise would wondered how sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original most of the vocal performances are firstrate tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work however one voiceover also stands out as horribly miscast kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector although he does lot of voiceover work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice he does not have the range pull off role like stinky pete the animation is even better than in the first especially impressive were the textures of the figures we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has slight bluish tint we can also see that bo peep is porcelain as you can tell from the longwinded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixars toy story this is pixars coming out party celebrate they appended their first project hilarious short about two desklamps and rubber ball the beginning of the movie they made the short in is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then on the downside toy story follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off bit stale and some sections tend drag overall though had great time and found story be worthy successor the first toy story bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family,1.0
david lynchs blue velvet begins and ends colorful bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in seemingly perfect american town however what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is strange world of drug dealers sadists and murderers the opening and closing shots are wonderful contrast the rest of the gloomy disturbing they show not make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances odd would be perfect adjective describe this its characters its direction and its story thankfully the obscurity that blue velvet relies on is enough make this enjoyable since its elements are so originally weird you never know what will happen next this is the main goal of movie be spontaneous and surprising blue velvet miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting lynch creates such hypnotic world that it is hard resist his style of story telling the starts off the discovery of severed ear college boy kyle maclachlan from this point maclachlan finds himself involved lounge singer isabella rossellinia who has lost her son and husband kidnapping the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynchs story telling so amazing maclachlan becomes involved in forbidden relationship in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of high school flick and he is put into the shoes of drug dealer who has some wild adventures some wild friends through these multiple stories maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan we are introduced variety of interesting subplots lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make convenient crowd pleasing conclusion instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough get the real meaning watch the several several times lynch has been known do this number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping get ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine however for fans of odd difficult indies blue velvet could be just what they are looking for it is very hard discuss blue velvet without discussing the performance of dennis hoppers sadistic frank most of the other actors in the were not very memorable kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role personality laura dern was consistently annoying but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession velvet his incessant breathing from gas mask frank is character that comes along once in blue moon many producers know this and have inevitably begun typecast hopper as the bad guy just like his villain in speed hopper is over the edge cursing and screaming every chance he has speak this harshness is exactly what frank is so weird and twisted that it is hard not look at him even if he theatens you look away blue velvet has characters and stories you will never see in movie again for this sole reason it is recommended but also see it admire lynchs obsession avoid the norm even if this is little too weird for you it is hard not congratulate guy for trying something new and sticking it,1.0

there is nothing like american history in theaters or on video no other feature takes such cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of white supremacy nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says love you plays derek twentyyear old skinhead dads subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father dad was fighting fire when they shot him now derek keeps his head shaved and has giant swastika tattooed over his heart derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence at basketball court black and white tempers flare derek channels the aggression into game black versus white for ownership of the courts when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the suckerpunch cameron stacy keach steps in dereks life as surrogate father he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as leader and organizer for highvisibility racial intimidation derek obliges leading his younger and dumber friends in racemotivated mob crimes at the bottom of the chain dereks younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants belong one night three black youths break into dereks truck is exactly what derek has been waiting for outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all the third wouldbe thief unarmed is only wounded in the key scene of the derek commands the kid into position where he can be killed one glorious enraptured awful stomp the funspoiling nc of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history was rated what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are bigger threat our youth than brutal ecstatic violence the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around cuff him the slows down derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in chilling sadistic satisfied grin now in prison derek faces new challenges as the black man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me there is clique of swastikawearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy they only use the symbols as means of intimidation derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed without dereks leadership they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he is screwed up in the end he spends quality time is brother trying undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny the ends little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the but it barely detracts from the overall experience edward norton gives an oscarworthy performance although some of his dialogue seemed be written without enough conviction nortons performance compensated an example that comes mind is his pep talk before looting the store he also captured the essence of an older brother he took his responsibility as role model his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart though clearly not for all tastes this is bold and daring the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard look at nevertheless its subjects are part of humanitys great face kaye gives us good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture,1.0
john von neumann progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project pointed out long ago that there is great way explore the cosmos even without recourse fasterthan light travel you send out selfreplicating robot ships explore and radio back information it may take decades centuries or millennia but it can be done achievable technology and does not require magical fasterthanlight drive in the fifties british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan suggesting that it would be better radio plans for complex computer and program for it any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer would then engage in realtime dialog the aliens exchanging information and technologies and hopefully arranging send back what it had learned about thirtyfive years ago the bbc contracted astronomerwriter fred hoyle and writer frank elliot create the scripts for miniseries called for andromeda afa concerned the reception of hoyle transmission the construction of huge computer the computers analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary facilitate communication she was played ethereally inhuman perfection the thenunknown julie christie audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for sequel andromeda breakthrough played equally high ratings dennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent wellstructured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into morass of chase and action mitigated only the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl feldman writes good scenes but has no idea how tell story or write movie even previous version use as model now in species we have mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed preoccupation removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined mediocre attempt emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases species features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in badlywritten portrayal of feebly amoral scientist forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly the script the species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the we really did not know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in position radio out set of blueprints for human beings even today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not copy of human dna because we do not have it analyzed yet the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt the script begins go off the deep end at this point when the result is beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms the first half of the has something offer as sil the alien girl struggles her multiform existence changing from beauty lizard giant cockroach and back again all while trying understand her own place in the cosmos she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society glaring gaps where her social skills should be her instincts are mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal her attempts in this area escaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued team of drafted civilians orders find her and kill her she goes on an eating binge spins herself cocoon and emerges as an adult played natasha henstridge who goes long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in the pursuers michael madsen is an assassinexterminator forrest whitaker is convenient empathpsychic just as though the s government actually had such people on call neither is able do much the writing and directing provided whitakers role seems be aimed at making whitaker male copy of star trek the next generations counselor cleavage the other members of the strike team are played marg helgenberger and alfred molina kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good not work the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was bit weak r gigers design for the main form of the alien creature is actually bit boring when we finally get see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly the main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then does not live up it all we get are chase scenes and few nice sex scenes few monsters tossed in there is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just sequence of scare scenes stuck together the movie is carried its chase and sex scenes but not rescued them on the other hand as an exercise in scifi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but and large it is fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing my personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you do not enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters mpaa classification violence gore nudity sex language stars

as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday the weary seasick soldiers take deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat they are unaware of exactly what is going happen one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck as the flap falls the battle begins they are trapped like rats in cage and proceed be blown pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire amid the chaos of this massacre stands shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindlers list soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the bodystrewn beach like lost puppy we are not invited know what he is searching for until he finds it himself he bends over picks up his arm and starts carry it probably not bothering ask himself what now saving private ryan is masterfully composed the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar the cinematography janusz kaminsky is also astounding but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic have ever seen the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as can get the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use the answer from my point of view is no braveheart was truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle ryan is ten times worse expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield many in the theater could not bear watch and it is shame too because this is otherwise far one of the standouts this year but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday through into the films primary mission captain miller hanks assembles an man crew and sets off find missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield the government goes great lengths make sure that mrs ryan does not recieve fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice millers crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin harbor secret hatred for ryan though they do not yet know him they resent having trudge out bring home one soldier who does not have any more or less right live than any of them this manages keep up rapid pace and though there is lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed the end the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in league of it is own spielberg though not student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope do it bay should pay close attention take copious notes if you want jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified the importance of the schindlers list taught many people the truth about the holocaust it opened eyes sparked debate and study though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they do not amount anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindlers list overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve see it again some day and realizing that this is something doubt could endure again masterful work marred only excessive gore,1.0
the faculty the heavilyhyped and advertised scifihorror that has teamed up director robert rodriguez desperado and from dusk till dawn and screenwriter kevin williamson scream and scream is being called cross between invasion of the body snatchers and the breakfast club and do not think could describe it any better than that the sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem have much in common and then the sciencefiction aspect is added involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town the six characters as in the breakfast club can be easily labeled as stereotype but as they are developed they become far more complex casey elijah wood the much picked upon nerd stokely clea duvall goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being lesbian so everyone will avoid her zeke josh hartnett drug dealer who turns out be science whiz stan shawn hatosy the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team concentrate more on academics delilah jordanna brewster the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist and marybeth laura harris the sweet southern new girl in town although the characters are only slightly connected e casey is delilahs photojournalist assistant marybeth tries become buddies stokely since they both do not have friends etc when they all begin suspect the teachers due some grotesque and strange occurrences the only people they can count on for help is each other even though they are not really even sure if they can trust one another the faculty is another smart and popculturally hip from williamson although it does not equal up his best the original scream and rodriguez whose from dusk till dawn is still one of the more original genre films of the williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions respectively that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much nobrainer the plotline of the faculty involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies has been done quite lot before from invasion of the body snatchers the puppet masters invaders from mars so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had overcome was somehow make the idea seem fresh and setting the goingson at high school and having the protagonists be group of teens they were mostly successful surely the conventions of the story are still the same and the climax was inevitable but there were few surprises along the way including the question of who were the aliens and who were not the epilogue was also refreshing changeofpace as it did not set up sequel but ended on note that probably could not have been any better the performances in the faculty were treat throughout since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do one exception were the teens who aside from elijah wood are not very wellknown but they all aquit themselves nicely particularly wood the seasoned pro clea duvall and jordanna brewster as members of the faculty robert patrick judgement day was creepy as the gym coach piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able look like an alien and salma hayek as the school nurse bad case of the cold was very funny in small role the standout in my opinion of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who after turning into an alien becomes the sex bombshell if there was any problem had the faculty it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence since the teenagers realize that in order save everyone they must kill the queen alien many of the faculty members disappear it might have been more fun if they had face every one of the teachers although the finale is still pretty impressive and includes some showstopping creature effects especially for relatively low milliondollar budget although not one of the best horror or sciencefiction films have seen the faculty is still an exciting and worthy that dimension films was smart release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released while the story is as old as the hills it is also in way timeless because everyone think has suspected at one time or another that certain person simply did not act right as if they really were not human and putting this idea in the setting of smalltown high school it perfectly contrasts the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating adults and other peers note the ad and poster campaign for this is hugely misleading as it features b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters in actuality he only has small role as one of stans buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team if were one of the heads from dimension would change this advertising at once since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving,1.0
