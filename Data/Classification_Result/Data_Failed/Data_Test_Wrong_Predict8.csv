natives arrakis fremen deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld young paul may fulfilment their prophecy man would come outer worlds lead them freedom unfortunately epic story unfolds confusing haphazard manner theatrical cut which runs minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended thinking among universals ohsowise money men films over two hours duration were popular audiences time would do well box office lynchs initial cut running closer three or more hours studio demanded further cuts made what great idea why trim down already complex so make almost incomprehensible most glaring consequence oneeyed stupidity hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us badly underdeveloped characters thus their personalities vague their motivations unclear case pauls father duke leto their demise rather meaningless end result distinct chill we cannot warm most cast we do care much them hardly helps voiceover narration sparse duneesque language terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook those unfamiliar book dune also very serous constant selftalk various characters makes so serious selfabsorbed times may find hard wince embarrassment overall impression world full people so intense no allowed joke lest universe come crashing down around them humour or least gentle kind humour distinct harkonnens mad sadistic kind hard find may balk comparison writer lynch could well done some lessons george lucus star wars trilogy theatrical version still some way being complete disaster however still possesses enough lynchs stylistic quirks enough visual

striking original magnificent score toto brian eno most underrated soundtracks last twenty years these elements place benefit freddie francis lush cinematography least feast senses see widescreen

mother gaius helen mohiam leader bene gesserit religious order secret aim manipulate pauls destiny its own shadowy ends paul atreides young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily character grows strength so does performance emerges credible leader fremen crusade conclusion any assessment must take into account frank herberts original novel complex piece work presents tough challenge any filmmaker david lynch took brave stab partly due forces beyond control ended up officially released version fails several key respects dune certainly confused frustrated lot people its release many chose stay away altogether films disastrous box office showing attests extended version however rather different beast lynch stated intention release own special edition directors cut home video clear indication dissatisfaction version ended up theatres alas failed do so choosing move other projects way then partly lynchs own fault what appeared instead unauthorised extended version put together mca tv special projects airing cable networks usa stung into action lynch successfully petitioned directors guild take name off credits replace allen smithee standard pseudonym directors wish disown their own work also had screenwriting credit changed anonymous judas booth certainly looking results mcas handiwork there least half dozen instances sheer technical sloppiness good enough reasons director object these gripes must considered light improvements extended cut dune offers several crucial areas most changes involve restoration or extension cut scenes addition extra narration both which fill many holes original versions storyline pauls relationship father associates more intimate moments humour warmth lacking previously political skulduggery involving emperor spacing guild bene gesserits two warring houses far better explained pauls initiation into fremen way life arrakis also fleshed out considerably further background new prologue has been added featuring narration painted stills give us brief history dune universe piece storytelling then mca tvs version dune clearly superior piece editing however times surprisingly inept use painted stills new prologue works well enough their occasional appearance once action begins inappropriate there some sloppy cutting too few instances shots even appear out order use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming going soldiers coming going times clearly outofcontext kind thing which lynch objected rightly so should also noted several questionable scenes shots theatrical version were deleted satisfy censorship demands s television most notable omission gratuitous piece nonsense lynch even herberts book scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling out heart plug its surreal disturbing episode very lynchesque adds nothing what we already know baron nasty piece work despite its own peculiar flaws then extended version dune generally superior all up contains minutes restored footage approximately another minutes either altered fabricated or newly created sequences unless idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change heart alan smithee version remains closest we will get what should been repeated viewings suspects closer than what lynch would prepared admit still centurys great sciencefiction novels some fans perhaps late herbert himself would
