so went and saw this right it was called battlefield earth was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this really is had that weird urge just watch it well let me be the first say and so far in my view it is safe say battlefield earth might be the worst have ever seen yes even worse than mr magoo blue in the face or jaws the revenge roger christianson whos credits include set direction and art direction for such great films as alien and star wars directs this such amateurism that the looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb that it is quite depressing the look of the is dark and drabby at times but then bright and happy at other times the sound is terrible and has the worst surround sound effects have heard the acting is nothing the dialogue poor and the makeup effects hideous heres the socalled plot earth man is endangered species while aliens from the planet psychlo the aliens are named psychlo wonder why are invading earth destined put an end those mananimals an end and destroy earth once and for all of course we have our typical hero played terrible barry pepper who was great in small role in the green mile who is destined go out and save his planet one thing he has go up against terl the chief of security psychlo who is played frankly quite bad john travolta whom dreadlocks big head and green eyes just does not work of course the sidekick terl is played lol forest whitaker who looks like deformed werewolf of some kind our friendly human johnny barry pepper looks just as bad as well long scraggly hair am not really sure how quite explain the badness of this except just say it is terrible everything in this is imcomprehinsable from the makeup effects the way are not good the phony looking special effects everything in this is faulted in fact do not remember one part in this entire movie where was having good time or enjoying myself in fact there is no part in the movie that liked or enjoyed throughout the entire minute running time was dying constantly looking at my watch and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow bulb or something sadly it did not my advice get new scripts new acting classes better directors and damnit make films like american beauty more,0.0
phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics tim rice evita now have admit the trailer for this rockoperaturnedmajor motion picture is almost breathtaking for some the soundtrack is wonderful listen so why would not the movie be wonderful see simple little over hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane the story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama that is trapped inside all the notes and chords she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soontobe first president of argentina they fall in love and eventually marry sounds pretty good does not it well the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying win respect eva duarte was wonderful lady however all of the dramapacked moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang fast be understood went into theater at magic cinemas the attitude that evita was going be terribly boring and left happy because was right they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar although it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eyecatching as was madonnas performance as the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscarcontender had she spoken single line but her chance was taken away the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical do not get me wrong and do not look at my grade am not big fan of musicals on the big screen if you are going pay see movie you want see movie now have admit it is lot cheaper pay than plus see the play but that is what did me in all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before even saw the movie now you may be saying what kind of critic is he and you are right as critic should have given the movie chance but as year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard,0.0
i have never seen man so in love himself than george lucas the overt success of the three original star wars films lucas has become not necessarily filmmaker but the head cheeze at huge toy company the phantom menace the new product on the shelve only this toy was made for million but every kid wants it and like all other expensive toys falls apart within an hour after playing it the product in question star wars episode the phantom menace jeez is pure and simple its about the money baby no one in their right mind would create such fiasco if they knew it would not make ton of money before its fourth week of release come the sw franchise as stranger since have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy phantom menace is like the first sw minus nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable even the special effects seem rather bland the story in this new one is mindless mess the acting wooden and the action sequences like something out of video game sw phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far title like sw tpm lucas has one big head on those shoulders thought chris carter did for releasing an xfiles movie although that movie adaptation was an excellent way spend two hours pm is one long headache,0.0
an affluent horse breeders past comes up haunt him an ages old coverup and blackmail comes back haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices that is pretty much the essence of the movie and have say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source the acting in particular found very good the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me get into the movie few things about the story did not sit very well me for example the original scam and coverup heavily involved the character played sharon stone yet in the end her character played relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more further the story along better on the flip side the character played catherine keener found be very interesting and thought that it was developed very well and helped the story lot the characters aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned have say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener all these people acted their parts admirably as for the part that sharon stone played she played it well but the part was not utilized enough the directing for this movie is something that have comment on because for once in long while you see director actually add very distinctive flavor movie this is one of those occasions matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin the movie and think he tackled touch subject myself would not be able look at horseracing and make movie out of it there is certain flavor about this movie and think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this the one flaw that do have comment on is the pacing the subject matter in my opinion was not interesting enough on its own have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if myself do not like it all in all found this movie boring and very slow the acting was good but the story just did not evolve enough and was not captivating enough make simpatico an enjoyable movie watch although there is much going for the movie did not find it good even though see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them would not recommend this movie anyone but if you are horse fanatic or racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie,0.0
a fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon hunter thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas written in is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the but also because it ushered in new form of journalism known as gonzo soon after the book was written hunter thomspon became the basis for character in doonesbury known as uncle duke and that is the problem fear and loathing in las vegas the movie although the book is one of my favorites now agree thompsons own assessment of the novel as unfilmable the main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and trippedout adventures was not written on the road it was written and edited hunter thomspons relatively sober at his home so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told sense of aloofness and some humor hunter thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has grip on reality and can still tell journalistic ability what is going on around him not so the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge unfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depps who plays thompson excessive narration and the characters while having vivid personalities are played as characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned the is very faithful the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent sports illustrated cover the mint and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs from there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards while the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end despite lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground the set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination however as we all know it is not sets or effects that make movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good,0.0
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks flesh out and brighten up dull dreary and overused idea doug liman swingers director of the ultrahip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such filmmaker in his latest he gives the viewers raucous neonlit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down druginfested path of misadventure as director but he fails come up any parallel structure in his multitiered movie and he fails connect the audience on any level bringing the worth of his efforts nil and the value of go about the same his movie is produced anthologystyle telling the same story from multiple three points of view much as an author might write serial novel consistent this ethic liman and screenwriter john august provide bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections other narratives the thread that laces the three stories together is drug deal and the events thereafter in story we have checkout clerk ronna sarah polley looking score some rent money and turning drug trafficking do it in story we have regular drug dealer simon desmond askew gone las vegas giving ronna her opportunity and in story we have gay soap actors zack jay mohr and adam scott wolf working undercover for the police bust said drug deal neither of the three stories have much substance and the movie has the feel of campfire story albeit rather strange one that could be told in five ten minutes in fact the movie was originally short entitled expanded feature length the early april release date is too mistimed capitalize on the movies christmas setting and the los angeleslas vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theatergoers attach themselves the characters are shallow the point of prerequisite and performances from littleknown players like polley askew and taye diggs do not help or hurt the roles in fact even bigger names like mohr wolf and katie holmes do not have enough time make substantial success although that is almost expected for lack of continuous screen time the success in the picture should come from thread that binds the stories go does not have this and it suffers because of it as far as teen movies are concerned go represents the absolute bottom for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme the following do not count as common themes drug deals people attempting have romantic interludes drug dealers people resorting drug deals for alterior motives or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them at times the humor in go is sickly funny and on low night almost watchable but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers this movie will best be left teens at blockbuster on saturday night,0.0
i feel sorry for the financial backers of waterworld is supposedly the most expensive ever made at million and is also one of the stupidest boy did they get ripped off in fact this is not really movie but more of an amusement park ride plot it is not even just another case of cliches strung together well it is that too it is something that is painful watch because it relishes in its flaws kevin costner stars as man who is some kind of mutant half manhalf fish he is an explorermariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered water because the polar ice caps melted he is referred as the mariner but they the meaner would have been more appropriate title because he is cold rigid and strict and he is supposed the be the good guy he docks at small floating village of sorts he trades dirt for money and this introduces us the other important characters first we meet one of the villains then the soontobe heroine child prodigy wacky inventor and group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today but also some of the lowtech tools used pirates and vikings immediately the films biggest flaw is apparent are these people primitive or highly advanced it does not seem like anyone can read yet they have skidoos and airplanes how are these things powered and if they have airplanes could not they just keep flying until they reached dry land also if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials make these things am sorry am all for checking your brain at the door when going the movies but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us there was potential here for good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology so why mix the two together it does not make any sense there really is not much of plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time explain anything the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child enola mojorino has tattoo on her back that is supposedly map dryland who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long figure this out we never get an answer just stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland make long boring stupid and just plain bad story short the mariner escapes woman named helen tripplehorn and enola they sail for long time encountering some strange people in the process and fight off the smokers as lead the idiot villain deacon hopper who kidnaps enola the story becomes overly grand adventure the mariner taking on an army of goons rescuing enola and bringing them all salvation how original even all its special effects action and adventure this is boring not single character is likable therefore neither is the plot dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker while costner just plain rips still waterworld is professionally made good production design and an original idea but no substance it just hope they do not make sequel,0.0
watch battlefield earth is wallow in misery it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history it has clumsily told story insipid dialogue shallow characterizations ugly scene transitions no evidence of dramatic arc headacheinducing sound effects and resolution that is completely implausible worse there is the promise of sequel why save your money some films go quickly video this one however should go straight the scifi channels mystery science theatre in the year man has become an endangered species most of humanity called mananimals was destroyed generations ago in battle against race of plundering aliens called psychlos survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved mine earths resources for the rest of their lives the aliens are menacing looking humanoid species that stand ninefeet tall who resemble inbred klingons dimwitted as they are tall their culture is predicated on power extortion and getting leverage travolta the leverageusing star plays terl the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terls petty machinations he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements maniacal laughter but one thing is certain he hates being stationed on earth when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet he begins devise his latest plan he will select group of slaves secretly mine out gold ore site it is not clear how this benefits terl except that it makes him richer in place where he has no use for it the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler barry peppers is selected as the slave groups leader psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining knowhow but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language the principles of our founding fathers euclidean geometry and the location of fort knox this enlightenment just does not prepare him for the mining assignment it also prepares him organize and stage massive revolt against their captors we are going blow up their home world he says but first we need few more supplies in days he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling loincloth wearing rat eating slaves fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts now the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl the media have been working overtime let the public know that john travoltas labor of love is piece of scifi drivel numerous journals have called it an illconceived idea stemming from blind hubris arrogance and poor planning and after watching this movie you will wholeheartedly agree this is terrible that is illogically constructed tediously acted and frequently begs the question why was this ever made at price tag of million this will be remembered as gigantic folly assuredly becoming the avengers of this summer both films were unforgivable and this promises suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity in addition the universally pejorative reviews there is another bizarre element the battlefield saga this would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta who for over decade had been trying persuade studios bring the story the big screen the controversy is that travolta is scientologist and battlefield is based on novel ron hubbard the religions late founder this led some believe that battlefield earth would amount scientologist dogma laden subliminal messages but the story is so poorly told that any message subliminal or otherwise is totally undetectable if the audience got anything out of this it was this we are not too unlike the psychlo leader like terl the audience felt imprisoned dreaded their situation and looked for any opportunity leave could that be the scientology message,0.0
you cannot have any of this it is all mine twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested an evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him for kicks the presence likes trick human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent his dimension and be systematically slaughtered when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted his existence and feel he is threat that needs be stopped they enlist the help of alison ramona midgett recent suicide victim return the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm her mission is melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed the kings sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided take abraham under his wing as an apprentice during the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided create new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled abraham wished follow his master into this new realm so he was asked show his devotion the evil wizard murdering his one true love in this new realm amblyn would allow abraham pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought this realm after each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyns because of the screwup that allowed the recent escape abraham was able destroy his master and take control of the realm himself as alison quests find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered if there is one thing cannot stand when see it is when the is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added this list this is essentially an minute stalkandslash following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds how you lived your life or any one of the plots nightmare on elm street through intercut almost minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of serve more confuse than further the plot if there are not bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone compelling but ultimately not the opening credits sequence is designed like music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the interspersed other random images the credits run the entire length of the song is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information does not pop up until near the end of the sequence when the opening credits began thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and interstitial from mtv had found its way my tv at least the music in the is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features song ramona midgett at the beginning of the it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people waving his hand in front of them and he talks like darth vader clone without the heavy breathing for some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes chop peoples heads off his shovel then there is an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace that take care of young woman who has been transformed into half doghalf human mix shotgun and of course big truck driving guy that likes tie people up naked the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds why would you want give responsibilities bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able round up exactly five friends complete the number of people required enter the realm at exactly the same time can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence the character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up be killed and is standing at the front of movie theater in the presence is seated priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next large platter of fried chicken he picks up the entire platter and starts enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on no interest whatsoever when she starts leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like either creature from gwar show or terry gilliam animation from monty python come life walks out and makes like it wants be crucified her the presence starts clap annoyingly continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off the strange creature following her when it finally catches up her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ the box for the claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of contains nudity and graphic violence while both is certainly true there does not seem be much of either in any large amounts besides loving close up of spurting neck stump semigraphic selfsurgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety as for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied the dragging incident ice from the sun has been released on vhs www bmovie com it has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer for shot good deal in mm is pretty decent besides the decent soundtrack is also available from www bmovie com makingof video is also available called on thin ice have not had the opportunity see the documentary but actually would have been interested see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed if only see how director eric stanze director of similar cult called savage harvest conducted the atmosphere on set,0.0

joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong it it has solid cast tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles but you can never judge movie its cast if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original unfortunately it is also incredibly stupid the movie begins joe tom hanks going work this opening sequence is very boring and slow it shows joe walking his office but on the way he has wait in long line passing strange and slightly depressing scenery obnoxious lighting sequence like this should take minutes here it takes over it is obvious that joe hates his job at his office one of his coworkers is meg ryan oddly enough she plays different roles in this movie joe leaves go doctors appointment his doctor informs him that he has brain cloud this means that in few months he will die so what does joe do quit his job of course when he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges graynamore tells joe that in order get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone sacrifice their volcano please their fire god startling coincidence the boat trip the island takes few months the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees graynamore gives joe credit card buy everything he needs go on this great adventure joe goes on date meg ryan his coworker the day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamores daughters she is also surprise meg ryan except she looks more hippyish they both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over his boat the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamores daughters and wonder of wonders she is also played meg ryan as they sail the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have craving for orange soda after some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went and that the brain cloud thing was made up they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage joe goes fishing and catches hammerhead shark this is cheap gag that has been pulled off many times but top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake one night there is storm cheaplooking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard fortunately joe and meg ryan manage find some of the luggage that joe brought sail pure luck they get the island since the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire stupid or what before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed right before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not when joe decides she goes in him because she loves him now this is where the movie should end but unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joes luggage they float another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers give this movie see it only if you are buff that enjoys bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan,0.0

the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered after all writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up fairly promising pair of parallel story lines the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead lee ermey facing hotlycontested election battle just as brutal double homicide is discovered at motel in his jurisdiction as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come be our prime suspects lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane ride from texas his utah destination all the necessary conflicts seem be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain the others protagonist but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years he is not supposed be tracking him any more according the bureau they have got their man but lacrosse has very important reason for believing otherwise two months earlier lacrosses own son was kidnapped the killer and the boy has yet turn up anywhere lacrosse knows his killers work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying continue their game it would not be fair reduce everything that is wrong switchback quaids presence but it is pretty good place start there is reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is perpetual tightjawed sourpuss pucker we can tell he is grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp more flexible performer might have given weight the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback _his_ quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated it is tough become emotionally invested in characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is big bowl of bran flakes even without quaid it does not appear that switchback would have stayed on course the early scenes between leto and glover have lively energy building our curiosity over man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses reveal once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on fartoocommon devices like cats jumping out of nowhere climactic fistfight on board freight train and edgy law enforcement agents it is too bad stuart was not willing spend more time sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the played atypical restraint lee ermey he is wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions focusing on the olmstead would have signaled filmmaker willing take few risks his casting and storytelling instead stuart places his trust in name star who cannot carry the material maybe next time he will throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene muck up perfectly good story,0.0
gregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst ever made so why did see his latest teen bisexual angst opus first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising last of all wanted give arraki one more chance mean the guy cannot be that untalented can he the answer that question is three letters long nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles since arraki does not know how make anything coherent it is hard describe the plot let us just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend will not make commitment him and jealous because she sleeps around other guys and girls the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as teen who has chance encounter famous tv star he turns out be nice guy who does not care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed fans this story has shocking twist and tragic end that did not see coming it is the first time ever felt any compassion for character created arraki and this can be attributed the appealing performance of lassez thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft he works better the camera this time around especially in the early scenes halfway through the did not necessarily find myself enjoying the but it seemed like considerable improvement on the doom generation then as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions it is sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it his usual in your face am such renegade maverick filmmaker look what can do attitude the performances are generally better than in the doom generation is not saying much at least we do not have suffer jonathan am the most hideous man in america schaech we are however treated another round of james am more wooden than keanu duval sarah lassez gives the best performance in the and kathleen robertson formerly of and now arrakis wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess of the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as deranged right wing tv evangelist if prefer nowhere the doom generation it is only in the way that would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture maybe greg arraki does not want you like his characters maybe he wants laugh and make fun of those of us who try care about them maybe he just wanted piss me off if so he was successful,0.0
sometimes when decide write short story or poem think of title first and then think of subject go it it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had similar train of thought when it came the title sequence would not be surprised if couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up story go along it the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began of course my attention dwindled shortly into the disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous it is teen horror no interesting violence or sex it is suspense no suspense it is an evil small town story no story speak of it is disaster listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses onestardom because of few good sequences mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits our main man is fellow named steve clark blandly played jimmy marsden he moves small town his family after tragically his brother shoots himself steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange homevideo like nightmares that he has occasionally the big trial for steve is of course fit in at school and make new friends marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down the last detail so he seems poor casting choice for social reject as social reject he falls in some pretentious dopesmoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people so it is up our group of mismatched protagonists solve the mystery and do something about it the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the still does not make any sense disturbing behavior was written scott rosenberg have seen his name around recently he was one of the toucheruppers on the armageddon script and imagine that for the most part he knows what he is doing when it comes screenwriting he did however have complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this and then decided actually take the time write it out evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also dismal failure but it takes lot of skill make the formula work rosenbergs script is complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained there is supposed be an element of surprise when we see what is happening the jocks but the never explains exactly what is happening they get strapped chairs microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sexcrazed superviolent machinelike creatures the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes the way high school kids act in one terrible scene gavin explains steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria up front should say that in four years of high school did not eat in the cafeteria even once that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorlyshown for instance he points the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing their laptops it is such an obvious cliche that cannot believe rosenberg even bothered most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one the other no sense of momentum or energy the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid there are few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn also liked the school janitor character played william sadler he has few lines that are surprisingly thoughtprovoking the acting is largely waste of talent marsden is as said bland thought not particularly bad bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction is not good enough hone in on their skills stahls performance seems more like parody of high school potheads none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cutouts of human beings run down hallways while screaming just is not all that cool disturbing behavior is wreck of and it started out wreck before shooting even began am surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make good or that it would make lot of money at the box office it is not boring or even blatantly awful but it is an uninspired lump of it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable so if you go see this take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends,0.0

synopsis sullen julie james still haunted nightmares of the killer ben willis from know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins trip for four the bahamas arriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they have walked into trap set the rainslickered slasher huge hook for hand comments may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five am only vaguely aware of the show is premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials halfpaid attention while watching the tube party of five do know however seems be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre neve campbell scream queen of the and star of scream scream and the craft is regular of the show so too is jennifer love hewitt lo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has horror franchise of her own the know what you did last summer line though the original released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout jennifer love hewitt is very goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles acting she just is not convincing in this and she was not in the original either this puts many young males including myself in paradoxical quandary she is very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girltype character she tries play here is annoying the extreme and ruins many of the scenes emphasize exploitatively her figure add the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience have spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for reason still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as vehicle for these two young actresses nothing else here is original or interesting this movie in fact makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art still know relies heavily on tired slasher cliches an isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of bluelighted darkness scenes garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the are going receive the business end of the killers hook they may as well have huge targets painted on them like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed serve as comic relief unfortunately still knows characters are not all that funny in particular one character chainweedsmoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly does not die soon enough the death scenes the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror several of them are uncomfortable watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie this too did not help the supposed humor still know was shooting for and what is the deal the slasher himself know that the slasher is not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror come on the guy looks like the gortons fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like disney pirate though his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror and that is really saying something so all that is left talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy both prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do nude scene hewitt however does do postshower scene in her thin bathrobe is quite titillating this scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves early in the for instance brandy wins the trip the bahamas she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever needed extrastrength tylenol after that part oh and the films conclusion talk about repetitive people who saw know what you did last summer will predict still knows ending at least minutes before it happens boring saw this movie my brother at the local downtown movie theater admission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just ridicule them it is usually fun thing do along the rest of the audience who do not seem mind participating in mass mystery science theater type viewing still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is if it were not for the main actresses revealing wardrobes would have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel cannot imagine trying watch it on video horror films seem times better in theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and would not recommend it people unless they are horror fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy read on website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works what depressing thought hewitt apparently needs spend more time on tv figuring out how act rated this contains lots of violence several gory scenes and couple nubile horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted would say this is unsuitable for kids but teens would not have problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the films target audience,0.0

what is like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie the garbage known as snuff films nothing right what is like about chronicling the world of violent trash pornography well nothing so why make it there is no reason why the average sane moviegoer will be interested in such topic no one is going enrich their life or have good time watching material such as this the lack of quality filmmaking in mm from technical acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting castall reputable but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but they are few and far far between basically this picture is crap and no one should pay see it why not walk out well this would not be thorough review about thoroughly bad movie heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of mm first thingif you do not heed my advice then understand what you are about see before you even think about paying good money for this crud it is not easy watch did not know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now the ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as surveillance expert and private investigator rich old woman discovers snuff in her late husbands safe she calls welles and hires him try and find out if the young girl it had be young girl did not it schumacher who appears be murdered in the really is dead she is horrified that her husband would have owned such in mm of course and just wants welles snoop around without police interference see what he can find familyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder let me backtrack for moment see snuff films are pornos violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead however the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies the thought of this industry makes me want throw my computer out the window and stop this review but will swallow my bile and move on welles follows clues and the porn industry you would think he is sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him he comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze after lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead led dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and startorturer machine christopher bauer they have big showdown welles where death and mayhem ensue the movie does not end there unfortunately because welles has do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome vigilante this does not draw you in it keeps you about miles away from it and who in their right mind would want get close it is possible like that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie seen but it takes large measure of restraint schumacher has none and larger amount of talent schumacher has little those jabs am not only referring his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but time kill was an immensely overrated disappointment for guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled good screenwriter and good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter writer andrew kevin walker did not recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for twisted thriller seen director schumacher does not have that innate ability make you watch things you do not really want see like better directors are capable of doing he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we do not see is more frightening than what we do especially when it is scene where young girl is supposed be murdered however gratuitous is joels middle name he must think that not flaunting hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint no he does not go that far but we see enough unpleasantness he does not leave much the imagination it is manipulating hurt or kill young girls just get the audience on the side of murderous vigilante the script and acting should be what gets us believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha craft case in point shot of christian fellowship bus good right drives away reveal one of the villains bad right see no subtlety does joel think we are stupid or that we need be held the hand comprehend the contrasting imagery who do we root for in this mess is there anybody out there it is not all the directors fault though why did the actors sign up for this nicolas cage is an oscarwinner for cryin out loud if he claims do films challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda what is cage supposed be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash he was so solid as concerned father in civil action guess ol nic pete and jim were promised mountain of money or they are suckers or they just do not care there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland catherine keener is good although too quick threaten divorce as mrs wells baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet the mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous mm is not too bad as woman dealing the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter this has an appropriate bluetoned washedout look like payback was much better movie the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times it is rough during some conversations closeups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look be editted someone whose instincts are not good and whose timing was halfsecond off such technical error indeed stands out speaking of standing out do not believe the misleading trailers there is not much action here occasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe after seeing mm may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again is that positive well if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing dirty movie again is their motive they have done swell job here it will be long time before give schumacher another chanceunless lose my mind and become seriously depraved but today am not depraved so ask why does this preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it am sure that somewhere right now there is some pretty sick crap going on but that does not mean need know about it yes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there yes mr walker the proverbial monster does not look like we expect him you said all that in move on this serves no purpose it does not entertain it does not teach us anything it does not make statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach only if this awakens the authorities find way abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile that is not likely happen though so mm is indeed scummy waste of money orson welles said years ago in tribute movies good movies if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker bury this crud deep in hole like snuff films mm should never have been made now excuse me while go try forget ever saw it useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme he used it in batman forever in batman robin in time kill in falling down and it is rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow,0.0
in the james bond diamonds are forever tiffany case asks whether he prefers brunettes redheads bonds response is that it does not really matter as long as collars and cuffs match well collars and cuffs do not match in the real blonde what might have sounded good on paper ends up as largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen the supposedly satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out the nth degree replete few unnecessary fantasy sequences writerdirector tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is fresh idea it is not the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary matthew modine plays joe struggling actor waiting tables in order pay the rent he is no agent and no credits since he is too proud take on roles in commercials or soap operas that is not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener whom he bickers constantly about sex but they need the money so joe finally agrees take part in madonna video but it is not really madonna starring in the video but lookalike played elizabeth berkley still trying jumpstart her career after showgirls this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes dicillo has referred the real blonde as offkilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff the wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and perhaps the single exception of the alwayslikable modine who is not afraid stand around in very unattractive bathing suit surrounded hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting catherine keener who is appeared in dicillos previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde look at her closely she really cannot act at all her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync her costars she reacts too soon or too late lines and situations she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much she frowns she yells she babblesshe blows chunks maxwell caulfield plays joes actorwaiter buddy bob the one obsessed dating natural blonde bobs personality not mention caulfields acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting maybe that is the point daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title soap dish who beds bob both on and offcamera hannah looks about fifty in this movie she is only why is that almost all the women in the wear tops that show their nipples why is that marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer and so on the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog there is more depth and sincerity in single closeup of her expressive face than in the entire while this contrast is supposedly meant highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it is funny,0.0

i did not come into city of angels expecting greatness have never seen wim wenders wings of desire the classic movie upon city is loosely based then again have seen enough stories are based upon similar plot device the little mermaid both the disney version and the original folktale being among them that had some high expectations about the possible power such story of impossible love can hold unfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them the plot for those that could not tell from the previews revolves around the angel seth played an almost creepy intensity nicolas cage who in the midst of his angelic duties falls in love heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally of course his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times talk her watch her buy groceries only disappear in the blink of an eye their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides make the ultimate sacrifice and become human using this framework as jumpingoff point the movie attempts veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire the joys of being human and the definition of perfection the first half of the movie succeeds on most points cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who does not know feelings so cannot really express preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hangdog expressions unfortunately cage takes the intensity too far sometimes and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive as maggie ryan manages be convincing as heart surgeon who has trouble coming terms her having lost patient on the operating table despite having done everything right her beauty unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss is mature intelligent and winning likewise some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen the audience experiences little of what it must be like be an angel the beautiful camera work shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels also gives us sense of the unique wonder angels feel the begins lose its way though when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie the grand angelic perspective gets lost except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angels eyes the movie devolves into an examination of how seth cannot feel the world or more importantly he cannot feel maggie he cannot smell her hair feel her touch or taste the pears she eats this change in focus attempts capture the audience in seths intense longing but in doing so the conflict disappears if he wants maggie so badly then why does not her just make the leap and become human after all what is so great about being an angel sure you get sit on marlboro signs but what is that compared getting be meg ryan and from there once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur it is all downhill the philosophy becomes heavyhanded the dialogue pedestrian when it tries be deep and the plot twists simply attempt yank few more tears into the audiences hankie it is the last thirty minutes of the movie then that wrecks the feel like the writer pulling out all the melodramatic stops has robbed me of what could have been genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level came out feeling robbed seeing so much possibility in becoming nothing could go on longer but do not want ruin the end revealing any of the cheap plot devices the relies on city of angels then is paradox it is wellacted particularly look for dennis franz cutting against typecasting as happygolucky fallen angel wellfilmed and based on wonderful idea all these possibilities though are what make the so unredeemable when the closing credits come up,0.0
plot summary the year is the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation shield invented connor mccleod the shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid connor is mortal and tired old man who has given up hope on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted the leader of terrorist organisation they have tried find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up connor is then attacked two assassins sent katana from the planet zeist like zeitget it they fail and connor becomes immortal again chopping their heads off he then brings ramirez back life in glencoe in scotland both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent earth as punishment connor now has the option return being the last one but opts stay his new found immortality and fight find out about the company and the shield katana meanwhile fearing connor would return sets out himself kill the highlander if you have never seen it being fan of highlander and mr connery was in the cinema as soon as could see highlander ii the quickening wish it had been quicker feel whatever else you can say about bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs be said the was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time mr connery is on the screen for is worth watching the plot sounds little ridiculous but was willing give it chance maybe they could pull it off instead find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first it is as if they are different people the same names witness connor jumping into bed the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants live forever when love must die gone the love subplot must have had footage cut out the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying still want know why connors coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal we are not given enough time on zeist believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords kill why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed quick chop the neck know the head needs come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent laser rifles first be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the worlds worst shot meanwhile connor develops lukeskywalkerlike powers of laser beam deflection as for bad guys we see rebellion on zeist crushed easier than grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed killing mccleod in case he returns zeist two assassins are sent presumably they are meant be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both no problems no more assassins are sent katana supposedly very powerful man goes himself kill connor has he no more assassins has he no better why was the rebellion crushed so easily then michael ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the kurgan he seems like cartoon character and really is not that evil just stupid and violent we see the trick of the chief nasty threatening child again and killing lots of innocents yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid threaten connor or maybe because his two best assassins would not have been amiss larry curly and mo so much for plot and characters the music is atrocious it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying bring back queen there was an audible sigh of relief when connor played queen track in juke box believe this at least is be corrected for the american release the acting is at best flat except for mr connery lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered there can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one highlander michael ironside is unconvincing sorry michael usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable so why visually the is interesting at all times it has blade runner feel it and some of the special effects are quite stunning add this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole or is he smirking himself his lines and delivery might make the worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey would have done it for million oh and agree previous reviewer she does look like sharon stone but believe it is her first incidentally there is line producer credited and hear rumours of highlander iii the wizard,0.0
cigarettes takes place on new years eve monica played martha plimpton is having huge new years party everyone in town is trying get there but some are caught up in other things this is the basic plot of cigarettes as we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots are unoriginal and not interesting at all this disappointed me greatly the should have been more about the party than the people trying get there in my opinion lucy played courtney love is kevin played paul rudd the two are in relationship that is more of friendship but starts blossom into something more than that this subplot is extremely boring and dull and am getting quite sick of plots like that janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot dealing kevin she plays ellie an exgirlfriend of kevins this subplot is completely waste of garofalos talent there was no point it at all and it was hardly even in the movie when lucy runs into bartender played ben affleck another subplot is formed the bartender is invited lucy come monicas party at the bar he runs into two more girls the girls are played angela featherstone and nicole parker but unfortunately due the terrible acting of both of them do not even remember their characters names ben affleck is good actor but his character does not go anywhere so he does not have much screen time give good performance featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles and they are part of the reason the is so bad christina ricci plays val and gaby hoffman plays stephie the two girls are trying get the party but are extremely lost they meet some guys and end up going around them all night this subplot was alright but it was quite annoying stephies accent hoffman did an okay job of acting but ricci did good she was underused considering she is such wonderful actress another subplot in the is the relationship between cindy played goldie hawns daughter and jack played jay mohr jack is an actor who does not care about the girls he goes out he just likes dates for one night and the next day he does not kate hudson is huge klutz she gets herself into very funny situations that are the funniest parts in the entire movie they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well this subplot could have been used more mainly due hudsons performance mohr was not good but he was not bad he was just alright did not find acceptable there is not much say about the performances in the none of the characters are developed or shown enough really tell if the acting is good or not the only performances that can judge are christina riccis as always good performance kate hudsons funny role courtney loves mediocre performance and paul rudds annoying and overused performance was hoping for little more out of jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle and especially out of janeane garofalo the two strongest things in the were the great soundtrack and the original costumes martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits made me feel like was in the year the soundtrack is full of tunes ranging from want candy tainted love the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the during the often found myself asking the questions is there reason this is there any moral story is there point are any of the events going on in the necessary do care what lucy and kevin are going through the movie is extremely boring and the time they reached elevenoclock one hour before midnight could not wait for the movie be over the plot is okay but the subplots make it terrible maybe if the was about the party not about the people at the party it could have been lot better the bottom line just like slasher movie this comedy is just one too many,0.0

seem have glued myself myself starring jason biggs seann william scott chris klein thomas ian nichols allyson hannigan shannon elizabeth natasha lyonne tara reid mena suvari eugene levy jennifer coolidge directed b rogers rated american pie reunites the cast members from american pie in different setting instead of being high school seniors looking score before they graduate they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in beach house enjoy the summer of their lives jim jason biggs is still an insecure geek looking improve his performance oz chris klein is still the sweetest guy on the block having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations his studyingabroad girlfriend stifler seann william scott is still horny stoner kevin thomas ian nichols still has no personality and finch eddie kaye thomas still longs for stiflers mom have missed anyone so obviously not much has changed this is not problem provided that the movie boasts the rapidfire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original but american pie is the very definition of sequelitis it is coarser yes and it pushes the envelope even more but its heart is not in it it is easy cash capitalize off the first films success but it would have been worthier investment prolong the franchise coming up something original part of the reason why the does not work think is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was comingofage stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness here everything has been cheapened they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking they have no motivation except for sex sex beer and sex that is not say that you cannot make decent comedy from that premise but it is one of american pie undoings missing too is the sweetness that permeated american pie the thiscouldbeyou quality of the main players here the characters are too aware of themselves as popculture icons and they are even more onenote stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim oz and kevin are forced make awkward selfdiscoveries at arbitrary moments none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want see and then there is the soontobenotorious scene where jim superglues himself himself perfectly demonstrates yet another of the films ailments one that also permeated say it is not so director b rodgers debut there is fine line between comedy and abject humiliation and american pie is on the wrong side of it it is hard laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them shielded my eyes watching this more than have watching any horror movie if there is one redeeming factor american pie it is the inimitable eugene levy as jims dad who pops in on jim as he is about score and utters lines like your mother and have been known get frisky not so much anymore but and then when the girls parents walk in blurts out this must be your daughter did not get her name but hopefully my son did if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levys performance this is an unworthy sequel grossfest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy the boxoffice of this onw should keep the genre going strong is disappointing the genre needs hiatus filmmakers are getting lazy,0.0
i will be the first admit it when you mention the book great expectations immediately begin experiencing flashbacks junior high english class where was confronted torturously boring book filled people such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch yes it is classic of literature but it was rather dry one shoved down my young throat like spoonful of bitter medicine certainly the experience was not truly that bad but quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book am not going tell the story the way it happened will gonna tell it the way remember it anyway return from nostalgia lane and get back the present in it is trendy attempt modernize the classics now presents an updated version of great expectations instead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as boy jeremy kissner and ethan hawke as an adult finn is an orphan being raised his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper the setting is the florida coast during the mids finn is blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects during one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro borrowing page from the superhuman max cady deniros criminal has seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor ok maybe that is an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the and that is nothing next the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat but digress anyway finn does the convict good deed just show that he is really swell guy and then the plot moves on enter miss havisham or ms dinsmoor here anne bancroft abandoned at the altar some years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role although she ends up nowhere near believable character she does add some humor the joe is hired help the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn be plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult for no apparent reason other than provide the main plot of the finn is instantly stricken for the estella perhaps it is her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met girl before in any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply does not exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the pining for her even when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself estella and draws her portrait in the nude there is nothing in fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during similar scene in as good as it gets at this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character and could not care less about the two characters the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow she fails imbue estella remote character in the book even the vaguest traces of humanity there is obviously something wrong when watching the you are more interested how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character without strong estella finns obsession seems baseless you wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on his life in fact the two relationships that work in the are purely tangential the main plot finns relationship his brotherinlaw joe is interesting if bit stereotypical what is more fascinating are his interactions deniro although it is only bit part it goes show how much vitality strong actor can create it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put lot of work in creating the imagery of the some of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes have any impact finns art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the but it mostly fails have the intended effect we never see why finn would generate this style of art is simultaneously crude and insightful as result it ends up as distant as the rest of the modernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeares romeojuliet simply update the action modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock but such adornments do little perk up great expectations as much as dreaded the novel when first read it you would probably be better off suffering though reading than watching this romanceless,0.0
you damn dirty apes that is just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that is taken on comedic context over time no one back then seemed realize how overthe top charlton hestons acting style was but it shows now particularly in this mystery science theater wannabe that was taken for masterpiece in its time actually winning one oscar for makeup no less and being nominated for couple others it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes escape from the planet of the apes return of the planet of the apes beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes planet of the apes the next generation police academy of the apes the list goes on heston is an american astronaut who spends few thousand light years in space his three companions and ends up on planet not too dissimilar from earth the thing is on this planet humans cannot talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species hestons companions are killed or turned into vegetables the apon is imprisoned he surprises them all his gift of speech making two primate scientists roddy mcdowall and kim hunter believe heston is the missing link between ape and man believe me we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years when the two apes present the idea before judicial counsel the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans it is received as heresy for all good monkeys know god created ape in his image but heston has already seen cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species before apes ever gained the ability speak and run for president and he takes them there holding up baby doll and yelling if humans could not speak then how do you account for this talking doll and how do you account for your acting ability mr heston the absolute most laughable scene comes the movies surprise conclusion will not reveal the details except say it involves heston falling his knees on beach and yelling god damn you all hell several times in succession the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed those members of society who like watch bad movies and laugh at them what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed function as some sort of social irony condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution but let me tell you if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges heston female ape may kiss you before go ape but you are so ugly he would convert creationism on the spot luckily for us sciencefiction movies have evolved over time the point at some of them are actually good,0.0
new address same old attitude do not forget recommend read the journal or send me some of that nasty hate mail starring bruce willis billy bob thornton liv tyler ben affleck written jonathan hensleigh and j abrams directed michael bay it rocksactually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they landonce in while when we need break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough destroy the chrysler building and the like nary mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon steroid users answer deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper famed oildriller commissioned the white house and nasa stop giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experienced deepcore mining plant nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry inspect deepcore driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including blond guy fat guy black guy wiseass and the man who is sleeping his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something do it cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day will not reveal nor will you care will say this you know you are in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely chance come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in last minuteand futileattempt inject warmth into the material steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic rockhound as he is called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him chair where he spends most of the so why did they bring him up there begin rather why write him into the give his almostwitty oneliners serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage his oil rig am guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen the middle hour is nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain whenever someone dies in this movie crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here must admit that not once could distinguish dead oilguycumastronaut from live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework it has vivid soundmix but at almost twoandahalf hours could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping catch people before they recover from titanicfever bollocks the lovers in the are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in mooncrawler remember little called jaws in this three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on fishing boat in pursuit of deadly shark they did not much like each other at first eventually they started respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of malebonding foreign bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we will care about them on the grounds that the world is about end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesi would be surprised if these actors bothered introduce themselves one another before action was called male friend who loved the suggested me that perhaps cannot relate bunch of men who do not bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and kind of chestbeating bravery this will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team could not build birdhouse and if get no respect for disliking movie all the synthetic feeling of trailera trailer for movie written team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsi have never been prouder wimp my whole life,0.0

all that education you should know what happiness is starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsuehwei directed edward yang written yang and wu nienchen cinematography christopher doyle and chang huikung every country has eventually its new wave france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us the balm of discovery taiwans new wave came in the in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beachyangs first featureis central it created new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts speak that language were hesitant and faltering later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan distinctive international presence that day itself is long and frustrating the document of nations attempt find voice it does not lack ambition it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling jiali sylvia chang is the focus but the brings others into its compassher husband her brother friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents no one is happy jiali married her husband welei at young age at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jialis marriage seemed in comparison good one she chose welei of her own free will they loved each other but it goes wrong that day dutifully presents all the clich welei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair coworker jiali feels restless and trapped bound choice she made while young but no longer seems wise the never redeems these clich conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured it unfolds awkwardly as series of flashbacks told during luncheon in vienna where jiali meets her brothers old flame teresa hu now concert pianist whom she has not seen since college both women seem rather sad and resigned their sadness their circumstances and those of jialis brother and college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available them were inadequate it is not that jiali married the wrong man she did not the problem is that she needed marry at alland that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy for woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins the films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan seen now it does not seem provocative indeed it is hard imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin young couples first kiss in the awkward meeting of woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief too often yang devotes needless time mundane scenesgrocery shopping flowerarrangingin nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted perhaps if the were content focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating but jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties at two hours and fortyfive minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently longwinded consider the defining moment for jiali the titular day on the beach the thrust of the whole explains easily enough what we are think of that moment what it means when she walks away from particular situation even so the has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point needless time is devoted expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout the look of the is as tedious as the drawnout narrative it was the first feature shot christopher doyleat least it is his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers in the freewheeling expressionism of his work directors like chen kaige and wong karwai he seems incapable of fashioning boring image you would never know it from watching that day due either doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible in scrutinizing the long decay of marriage that day manages capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak,0.0
the first in very long list of things wrong still know what you did last summer is the title think about it for second if the last movie was called know what you did last summer would not the next movie have be still know what you did two summers ago if anyone working on this movie had an q greater than five would have thought about it logically and said hey wait minute but alas the people behind this are obviously idiots so will not hold them that what will hold them is the fact that they have pretty bad movie on their hands even for teenage slasher flick guess am one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original emphasis on the kind of it was not great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good but at least it did not have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it is sequel did there are just so many problems this movie that it is hard trying figure out where start first of all guess is the setting the movie offers no rational reason why the had take place in the bahamas other than the fact that the producers wanted seaside setting exactly why does the fisherman want go through all the trouble of faking radio contest get julie james jennifer love hewitt one of the only survivors of the first and her new college buddies out the islands before he hacks them up the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through in one scene julie is in tanning booth at deserted gym when the hooked fisherman the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress cannot get out no matter how hard she tries when julie discovers she is going slowly fry death she screams for help and her friends come her rescue now this is all fine and dandy except for one thing instead of spending five minutes trying bust open the booth why not just turn the freakin thing off in another scene one of the characters after having their significant other all but decapitated the man in the slicker says julie just do not tell anybody it rained the whole time oh yeah have just been terrorized hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered but hey will crack jokes anyway after all it is in the script the films only saving graces are few wellexecuted suspense sequences and really cool cameo the reanimator himself jeffrey combs he brings some good comic relief and life an otherwise limp movie way go jeffrey have hunch that the reason this fizzles while the first one at least kept it is head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson scream and even it is sequel he displayed real talent as screenwriter his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him standout from all the rest of the horror writers and think still know has really suffered not having him on board the cool atmosphere is still there this time around but just did not like the characters or the writing as much as did in the first one even though the movie does not have williamson it still has hacky ending trying do what kevin did the first two scream some may consider this spoiler but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever then you should be able guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes having two killers and this time having one of them being family member the other think someone in the audience put it best when after the movie had ended another the killer is back cliffhanger he said who is this time the grandma all in all still know tries be as successful as the first the was but really fails in the attempt mean it is okay when slasher movies ripoff each other but when they start copying themselves,0.0
there is nothing new under the sun is phrase often used when the speaker actually means let us find something copy of course there are very few completely original ideas even earthshattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience there is after all no need reinvent the wheel time after time recently it seems that does not feel the need even rewrite the script my understanding of the word sequel is continuation of the story the industry has defined the word mean reshooting the original minor changes have an overwhelming desire see an inferior version of brian depalmas adaptation of the steven king novel this is your dream come true rachel emily bergl high school outcast is beginning notice weird things happening around her doors slam shut themselves glass globes blow up her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent popular boy unexpectedly asks her out the incrowd conspires embarrass her at public event any of this sound familiar once the audience catches on that this is the same story as carrie there is little do but wait for the inevitable ending the effects are bit better this time around but the does not work nearly as well there are couple of minor plot differences rachel lives foster parents because her mother is institutionalized the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original they keep score of their scoring points given for each conquest and uh there must be other story changes but none stand out one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell over years ago she was the one girl who tried help carrie now high school counselor she befriends rachel but her characters potential is squandered there is too much about sue that does not make sense after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachels mother is in still living in the same small town the woman wellknown history of mental problems is hired as high school counselor sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is genetic disease this may be the one original idea in the but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as disease is never explained sues eventual fate is an admission director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but could not figure out what do her blink and you will miss it some of the events are filmed in black and white but the rationale for this is unknown it does not add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random the rage retains some of the trappings of carrie without the meaning in the first the color red was motif connected carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating here there is an abundance of red but for no apparent purpose the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning wear thin one might be lead suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds the biggest mistake the makes is including clips of the original seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points the quality of that and the flaws in this one,0.0

jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts be heartwarming family but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability be the least bit touching this does not come as surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on current streak of one bad after the other jack frost michael keaton is struggling middleaged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and yearold son charlie joseph cross but does not spend nearly enough time them when he receives call from music label that wants hear him play he has cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in car accident and dies switch forward year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having difficult time coming terms jacks death when charlie begins play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over jacks spirit jack wants spend some time his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries prevent his melting demise frosty the snowman is classic cartoon and the idea of snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as liveaction it does not work at all after somewhat promising prologue in the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play since jack has been deceased for whole year you would think there would be many questions ask him such as what happens after you die or how does it feel be snowman but instead the focuses on snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before even sat down watch the movie the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves be punished appearing in silly like this michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing his career here have always liked kelly preston she is clearly talented charismatic actress but has never been given good role in her life usually having settle for onedimensional supporting character as in nothing lose and addicted love joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed boy suffering the loss of parent in one of the only subplots that actually works due its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman this brief hint of cleverness is pushed the side however the triedandtrue main plot at hand is the sappy story of father and son since knew what was going happen the time the conclusion came around had no choice but sit there and listen painfully insipid cringeinducing lines of dialogue some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie no da snowman replies jack or how about this little zinger coming from school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries help him out snowdad is better than no dad do people really get paid in for writing pieces of trash like this the snowman created john hensons creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last years unintentionally hilarious directtovideo horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult tell if it was person in suit or computer effects either way it was an awful lot of work go through just come up final product as featherbrained as this project as seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much clunker better christmas from this year is will be home for christmas better yet my suggestion would be stay home and watch quality such as it is wonderful life christmas story or prancer jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided and children as well as adults deserve better doubt they would want see movie about the death of parent anyway,0.0

you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me they are as real as life once talked guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit could fry an

nasa is trying kill the president causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous us but is all in days work for him he combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goingson behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions upstanding citizen that he is he tries convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned lucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from couple of muggers and has had listen his theories during the six months since what she does not know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than well professional he goes great lengths follow her around and watch her in her own apartment but when some secret government types seem take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limitedcirculation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help one of the problems conspiracy theory is that it tries pass itself off as an actionthriller when it seems have neither whole lot of action nor significant number of thrills part of this is result of the films slow pace it takes forever set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over the rest of the seems be lot of boredom that every once in while stops take break for excitement at over two hours this could have been significantly condensed and had it is running time shortened twenty minutes half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able save the instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces we are treated few of the generic scenes the requisite black elements black helicopter men in black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill they come on down all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason guy just bunch of theories and some chick no training somehow manage elude them every time big deal we have seen it all before watching the wished donner had at least tried use little imagination but was out of luck now when say it took forever set up the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person is relative the other and not romantic involvement oh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you believe that the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love each other but there seems be no evidence of that ever occurring you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory the two just do not click and when you throw in number of happenings that would cause alice reject jerry altogether like finding out he is been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced the script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him write it then took it and forced it upon us dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable the point that almost stopped listening even gibsons usual gift for ad lib could not punch up the sufficiently raise my interest although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing unfortunately much of what is discussed in the is not inherently important what is going on but instead filler that starts out potential but ends up just being extraneous because it is never followed through for example jerry professes that man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered the government in new york subway station he even goes so far as explain that the station was flooded at the time due water main break hence the water in subway station and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine this is convincing enough alice that she seems believe him you know what happens then nothing zip nada no followup whatsoever so what is the significance okay heres another one couple of well known real life assassins were found have possessed copies of the d salinger novel the catcher in the rye jerry also has bunch of copies whenever he goes into bookstore he has buy one leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin we are never given reason believe why this would make him an assassin not when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes the bookstore not later on when we get the answer our first question the point becomes totally extraneous oh did mention that patrick stewart is in this yeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be bad guy that is about it for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has he is nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory you can just lump him in the supporting players the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi this guy was really likable and wish he and his character had gotten more screen time okay heres my theory this really started out as great but some of its jokes were actually true the government came in and forced donner make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over,0.0
my son and share perverse predilection for bad movies we are amused and entertained the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting since other family members aspire higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together cannot remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of clunker until species came along he was not amused on the other hand was able easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained perhaps the evident skills that were brought the process of producing bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing insulting my intelligence and brought adequate moviemaking skills the project movie does not have be good be well made at least in terms of the craft the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque this movie slaps you conception pregnancy delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames without pausing for infancy the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in womans womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm and few seconds later young child tears its way out of her abdomen in sloppy and gory version of an insideout cesarean an autopsy scene in buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that condone say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect in real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp it is used only after the skull has been exposed the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for subtitle as bad as it gets as the movie progressed vowed remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck eve natasha henstridge was cloned from sil the original alien sexual predator but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated was all that was needed turn her into noble and cooperative prisoner in wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer marg helgenberger i think of all the places that will never see and all the people that will never meet it is enough melt the most callous heart at another point she protests i am human too you know she is only half right peter medak the director knows his business justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing enhance his credentials james cromwell his father is perfect in short role marg heldenberger the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful natasha is an exquisite ornament george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up michael madsen was there black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages stay around for the final credits is more that we can say for lazard,0.0
it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies offensive subject matter than make movie about guy split personality it is exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care the wind get laugh jim carreys signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out levying complaints against the brothers new before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just could not take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie is not funny it is not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped his wife for midget limo driver decides bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable muster this guy is not above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in he is been insulted or holding little girls head underwater because she refused stop jumproping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the runs off its tracks some have suggested that this is not problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor does not require plot work they are wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort there is something about mary outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier was not funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleightofhand trick they would have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene contrast seems have been made folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they have not come up way make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy the plot carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who is in more trouble than anyone knows back new york has an ending that is entirely predictable from the getgo think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage do anything you have not already expected them do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared the curveballs the farrellys are used throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value it is no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language an entirely toopleasant smile on his face but the end of the they are still doing the same schitck it has not been elevated another funnier level and it has not been dropped either that is too bad because it ceases be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought be more focus on how other people react charlies new personality and on how charlie deals the consequences of hanks actions this does not really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they do not have any opportunity be surprised it the throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script does not go anywhere it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he is left nothing much do here except contort himself in manner similar steve martin in all of me it is great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey does not pull any stunts we do not expect him pull and the farrellys script does not give him anything else pull the situations in he must perform the roleshifting are not set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellwegers irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled irene is nothing in particular as the never makes clear whether she is ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing latch onto as the only sane person in the chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise it and stop being shocked but do not believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they will rebound just fine even after that happens though will still consider me myself irene be highcaliber misfire,0.0

i came an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy it is not the sort of in one would expect achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless sat there watching this marshmallow of movie unfold when suddenly realized what is so ridiculously wrong the entire romantic comedy genre circa in word it is the same thing that is wrong so many movies circa writing more the point it is the refusal acknowledge that characterizations matter when you are telling story about relationship the bachelor is merely the latest in long line of films where we are expected get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because they are attractive and pleasant in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit is jimmy shannon chris odonnell single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage it is scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years convinced despite his reservations that it is time sh or get off the pot jimmy proposes anne very badly anne refuses leaves jimmy in very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves very specific video will jimmy stands inhereit million if he is married m on his th birthday stays married for years and produces child there are only couple of minor problems jimmys th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere be found meaning jimmy has find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends it is wacky brewsters millionsesque premise acknowledged as such in one of the films better more selfaware lines of dialogue the kind where shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters at least that would be the case if jimmy were not already worldclass altruist screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy does not get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs from the outset jimmys motivation is not cash it is the livelihoods of his devoted employees it is almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings play role in the bachelors plot development any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless and that is the essence of the gutlessness endemic films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws overcome on their way happiness there is never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers because there is no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake the blandly nice odonnell could not pull off randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers do not even let him zellwegers anne may have issues her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard live up but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together feel invested in their potential reconciliation the parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny since they are all that stands between us and blissfully sweet foregone conclusion will admit couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinovs rantings about procreation and restaurant fulltobursting men popping questions and champagne corks far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in church you are never going get too many raucous belly laughs from like the bachelor but that is not the real problem nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion it is leading up the problem are beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy there is no spark no energy no humanity it is an emotional pudding guaranteed not offend any consumers digestions we have reached point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment do not even have pulse the bachelor is love among the mannequins,0.0

saving silverman is good example of good comedy gone bad as love story it is good however as comedy it falls flat on it is face think throughout the short minutes laughed total of seven times and those were just chuckles at the most the movie does not have the oomph make it great movie and does not have the script make it funny movie wayne lefessier steven zahn d mcnugent jack black and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow stay close till the end while in bar after doing show their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for wayne and d however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again it is up wayne and d try and begin saving silverman the performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat jason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself jack black is well jack black and he does an all right job as d but he is not as funny as he has been in the past amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond he is better at singing than acting anyway the performances in the are good but it is too bad the script is not speaking of script hank nelkans choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street the trailer for the movie as most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts somewhere saving silverman was meant be good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it was not dennis dugans direction is all right he adds few directorial touches here and there nothing special being simple comedy saving silverman is perfectly bad movie in more ways than one it has great cast good director and sweet story it is just too bad it has bad script and is all together bad movie,0.0
one of my brothers favorite movies is b halickis cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the carchase genre that provided drivein fare during the chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had strong visceral appeal although it boasts bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull randall memphis raines nicolas cage is retired car thief who runs gocart track he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars however kip became thief anyway and now he is in big trouble kip promised deliver fifty luxury and sports cars gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston the end of the week calitri expects memphis fulfill kips bargain if he does not come through kip dies memphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys j cross william lee scott scott caan and james duval as if calitri breathing down their necks was not bad enough the team is pursued cop delroy lindo who is still ticked off that he never busted memphis and rival gangster rap star master who wants take over calitris clients watching gone discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one maybe that is why the first fortynine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor shelby gto model that has always eluded memphis but the big chase does not live up the long wait had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic senas second kalifornia his debut was brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience in that movie sena took simple thriller plot couple gives serial killer ride and successfully endowed it deeper significance in gone he seems be aiming for drama about two brothers who cannot communicate each other but that goal just does not mesh this plot gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough it is not light enough be fun or mean enough be intense this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it the lack of action is waste of the premise should have challenged the filmmakers create the most spectacular car chases ever the weak script is waste of talented cast in newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies much as like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air mm city of angels that ratio is probably better than what lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent it is shame waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in seconds,0.0
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive if you can take that as true statement then your disappointment at this will equal mine martin can be hilarious creating some of the best laughoutloud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters you will not find any of them here the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit bilko and the name is not an accident is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his schemes every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hairbrained plan get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base mchales navy granddaddy that is the idea behind this movie too but the difference is that as farfetched and usually goofy as the television series was it was funny there is not one laugh in the the remake retains the goofiness but not the entertainment everything is just too clean it was obviously made on back lot and looks every bit like it it all looks brand new even the old beatup stuff martin is remarkably small in what should have been bigger than life role in the original phil silvers played the huckster heart of gold and more than touch of sleaziness martins bilko is pale imitation the only semibright spot is phil hartman as bilkos archenemy it is not saying much considering martins lackluster character but hartman leaves him in the dust,0.0
have you ever been in an automobile accident where you have miraculously walked away only few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck well that has never actually happened me and hope that none of us will ever experience this situation but after watching this inane exercise of movie certainly feel that have miraculously walked away unscathed after twohour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond oddly eye of the beholder is psychologicalromancethriller starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us british intelligence agent called the eye ewan mcgregor working in washington dc in the humorous opening scene he eyes top lawyer across the street in his office his pants down using an array of hightech surveillance and communications equipment he proceeds transmit pictures of the bared lawyer pc screens and fax machines in his office the law firms employees get good chuckle the audience gets good chuckle the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters beautiful woman ashley judd there is something compelling about this mysterious woman despite her glamorous looks however we learn that she is psychopath propensity kill men that get too close her after the murders she sobs while singing the christmas tune little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned her father long ago after each killing she puts on different wig assumes new name and then makes her way another state the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions but he does not alert the authorities he somehow empathizes her sense of loss the eye it turns out also is haunted his past his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life his tormented psyche creates ghostlike image of his daughter he engages in conversation she becomes sort of spectral adviser and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman he now diverts his energies into trying help her find some kind of salvation it does not matter that he has witnessed all of her murders and it does not matter that the eye is abnormally reticent hiding his entire life behind computer screens he follows her dozen different locales and shadows her every move keep her out of trouble when crazed druggie jason priestley attacks her he shows up for some quick butt kicking when the police are closing in arrest her he provides distraction so that she can escape all the while the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight peculiar how bad is this movie refer you my review quote source litmus test just take look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes for this movie they are from magazines called flaunt and mirabella no doubt they were impressed judds series of catwalks and disguise changes the major problem eye of the beholder is that the jerks forward always unsure of its ultimate destination if it was thriller there was little keep us entranced if it was love story there was absolutely no emotional pull completely disjointed in structure it is only saving grace was its stylish look reminded me of my favorite car commercial the one where the on the tachometer dissolves into winding road and passenger rail car dissolves into small miniature on childs train set am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find serious role showcase her potential talents beyond that the is hopelessly outofcontrol and is in need of seriously better traction and handling,0.0
bad bad bad that one word seems pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls if that summary is not enough for you how about ta ta ta still have not got the point other than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the aforementioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason recommend even taking look at this movie that is the fact that it was cowritten famed critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay after watching this movie you will never be able sit through another one of his reviews where he gives movie thumbs down for bad writing straight face this movie stinks out loud quite frankly this movie deserves but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny so am giving it and maybe that is too generous right from the opening credits knew that had classa bomb on my hands not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes big breasted young woman being chased guy in nazi uniform had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut completely unrelated scene be honest as sat through this movie mesmerized just how incredibly awful it was actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the the quality of the writing during the rest of the it would not have surprised me if the opening had never been explained so what is this movie about you ask like it really matters ok here goes this allgirl band headed kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go try gain foothold in the music industry once there they do manage find success due as much their hooters as anything else it sure was not for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get them everything from big egos booze and drugs free flowing sex sends them on downward spiral there are couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing from creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here other than the abovementioned obsession big knockers that russ meyer seemed have the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts mr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out now ask you lines like that how can you go wrong ebert had tried inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter do not know but all the big words in the world would not be able disguise the bad writing and even worse acting but the wretched dialogue goes along well the wretched quality of everything else in this movie have seen home movies directed better than meyer managed this turkey in fact there is one scene the one in they are in van driving make their fortunes during really had question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries add the directing and writing the music in this movie almost got up check my sound system see if it was broken there was such pile of crap emanating from the speakers then we have the cast first lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band this has got be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of motion picture camera sadly his acting does not come close making up for his looks if you have been following along up this point this should not surprise you meyers stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive go along their other assets dolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band and no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents and yes she does loose the shirt few times and display her impressive talents sadly her ass is almost as large as her chest hey it sexist movie so am writing sexist review then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in fairly small role as casey one of the other band members this goes along the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie meyer casts gorgeous playmate rack kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all sure russ now is the time get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows on the up side she does have fun lesbo scene sound like am writing review in porn magazine but hey will admit it the only reason that actually managed sit through this damn movie was catch look at cynthia myers naked and since that was huge disappointment pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey the only thing that can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it unless of course you want feel good about yourself knowing that even pulitzer prize winning critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet this is movie that should be avoided at all costs an even better idea might be require video stores place warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous your common sense proceed extreme caution,0.0

often similar little boy lost in park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe toque do oboe is disappointing that seems have wandered astray many elements of the are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply do not convert into solid work although setting is never established it becomes apparent the takes place somewhere in latin american village in present day the community is dull one where every day is downhill slide from the last over time the people have taken themselves the town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied no one other than the grave digger so what happens when tourist paolo betti does arrive one day he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock it is revealed that he is musician who plays the oboe as hobby when he sits down in the park one day give solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees play at the local cinema in accompaniment silent thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens be engaged the towns police inspector figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement this musician the rest of the plot closely resembles freak show gone horribly astray it features character who literally rises from his grave woman who has phone conversation god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character an almost humorous drunk technically this is nightmare the music score is poorly edited into the so it is often choppy rough and abrupt the lighting is poor at best makes it increasingly difficult focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the when what seems be relevant fight is filled dialogue but the subtitles are limited fewer than words in addition the pace of the seems uneven it opens series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience the then moves into faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined reach the two hour mark there was however potential for this it is piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the reunification of people these are all topics that could easily fill movie perhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were improve there might just be thing of beauty at the end most importantly though the director would have patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours are not such bore until then there seems be little more hope for this piece than that boy has simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in park,0.0
a friend invites you movie this would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare and be grounded in reality the plot is as follows after terrifying incident mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city they need fresh air get some perspective maybe start over romance begins brew however as one of the locals played an international superstar in rugged clothing sparks things up especially at countrywestern slow dance it stars rising young starlet helms good cast and is directed one of the better actorturneddirectors in you accept you jump at the opportunity see what you believe be _the horse whisperer_ but poor moviegoer you have been conned alas you find yourself watching incredulously _hope floats_ oh woe your hope has sunk why was this movie made why was it released it is travesty on nearly every level and has the authority sink the careers of nearly everyone involved at the hands of better script the could have been gem but it is clueless as what it is about and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness us poor viewers _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy who after discovering her husband has been cheating on her her best friend on national television no less takes her daughter and drives back her home helmed countryish bumpkin eccentric played gena rowlands she decorates stuffed wildlife birdys nephew travis played _leave it beaver_s cameron finley is under her custody and in one of the films many failed injokes is always seen wearing different halloween costume what is the point of this does it make any sense is it supposed be funny the point of the is show that the family is eccentric but was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of child all of this undercuts the plot of there is none there are only many scenes that are supposed register emotion there is the scene where birdy who used be the prom queen is humbled approaching peer she once mocked for job there is the scene where birdy dances her father in the hospital for alzheimers and then there is the sentimental scenes justin played harry connick jr who is taking liking her again showing her beautiful pad that he built from scratch and during each of these scenes was sidetracked my earlier question what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as provide dog costume kermit costume cowboy costume whip and full furred barney costume for her grandson wear during dinner what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life outside of this there are other sure signs of screenwriters block when the daughter stands up the bully at school when birdy almost loses her job when the family pulls in goofy lipsynch cheer someone up when someone dies when the daughter cries no wails in exasperation that her father is not coming back in movie like this you notice the strings being pushed and you sit there comatose hoping it will end who can survive such debacle worry for bullocks career has been running on autopilot for the last few years she has an attitude solid perkiness and can drive busbut she cannot handle the emotional scenes much less hold southern accent harry connick jr is worsestick singing or get some acting lessons please gena rowlands is the best part of the but she is such good actress that it staggers the mind that she is weighed down such lukewarm material here it would be severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this two notes forest whittaker cut the slowmotion sequences there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction such failed trick have you done so you could have shaved off tenminutes of this almost unbearable debacle you have had know something was wrong if your cinematographers filter makes the candlelight appear like little s you are not bad director but you cannot change terrible script there is recurring scene where birdy working at the neighborhood fotomat finds the machine go wrong and image after destroyed warped dark image appear think about it succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie,0.0
any remake of an alfred hitchcock is at best an uncertain project as perfect murder illustrates frankly dial for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace little perfect murder has inexplicably managed eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of wouldbe thriller almost all suspense films are loaded plot implausibilities the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what is going on so that these flaws in logic do not become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled unfortunately in perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they are happening this is very bad sign not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder of course in the case of perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters perfect murder is not strict remake of dial for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play was also the source material for hitchcocks version as well as madefortv retelling emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes michael douglas their marriage is not going well emily resents stevens controlling instincts and as form of rebellion she is having an affair penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen when steven learns of the relationship he decides confront david but his approach is not that of typical cuckolded husband instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david proposal that is too good resist for in cash before the rest after he is break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers ask how he is supposed get the rest ultimately am not sure of the three main characters we are supposed be sympathetic the coldhearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing do the deed for halfamillion or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but they are not interesting it is possible make good movie detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has be something compelling about them in this case there is not steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting text book on stereotypes the actors in this are obviously just on hand get their paychecks michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep he is gordon gekko an unfaithful wife gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of worst thrillers the other being hush at least viggo mortensen i jane has little fun his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emilys best friend perfect murder is plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning end there are not many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script makes the ending inevitable almost from the start it is surprising see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs earn living it is just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems be an honorable way go about getting the dough,0.0

look the new version of psycho came out and the world did not end guess gus van sant really is not the bringer of the apocalypse unfortunately though that psycho did not end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it van sants controversial retelling of alfred hitchcocks classic has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the will at best suck being an almost good critic waited until actually saw it decide that the at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that am braindead orangutan director gus van sant took the original hitchcock and refilmed it shotforshot using the same exact script few minor alterations the inherent challenge was in making the suspenseful and scary even though large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able create something new or different than the original sadly that did not occur it is hard be overshadowed vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened julianne moore and viggo mortensen in moores case the would have been helped if the files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire doing scully impression from the cold demeanor and expressions her rigid way of forming sentence moore is scully mortensen who liked in i jane opts play sam loomis as cowboyhick would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point sam has twang and cowboy hat but that is about it mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory anne heche in the janet leigh role does few good things in her brief time on screen at least her marion crane has little life in her cannot be said for most of the rest of the cast the best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mamas boy norman bates he is not going make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice the best part of the is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk there is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the van sant has made boring all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in are not as eyecatching now what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times so many directors that they do not impress or excite van sant in what assume is grasp at originality decided put some streamofconsciousness images into few famous scenes was that lamb in the middle of the road these images included some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter definitely not hitchcocks intention at least danny elfman had the good sense not mess bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score if like psycho does not frighten then what is the point aside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection the audience there are things van sant and company could have done at least make their recreation interesting in the end however the new psycho is noble attempt but alas dismal failure,0.0
an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten werewolf in jolly old england the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects more specifically the makeup used for the transformation of man into werewolf and for the ghosts that haunt the main character even twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive although would have say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive the rest of the movie is run of the mill werewolf flick some extra gore thrown in for good measure if it were not for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in and good reason the acting is not great and neither is the writing well ok we do not actually expect either of those things be great in horror but one other important element is lacking here too it is not scary no exception you know what is going happen before it happens you do not even need the obligatory scary music give you hint will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that have ever seen but john it just was not scary did not know if this was intended be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in get people come the theater see it but it did not work for me actually it was intended as sort of spoof on horror films but the mix of the comedic moments the melodrama was so bad the intended humor was lost on me it is never good sign that you do not realize movie is supposed be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material call me crazy but you should not have do research on movie enjoy it am not even going get into the plot of the movie that much since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up werewolf bites boy david naughton boy ends up in hospital where he is tended and eventually falls for pretty nurse jenny agutter and then strange things begin happen boy including and must admit this is very nice touch visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up him in the hospital the neat thing here is that his buddy is rapidly deteriorating corpse know it sounds strange but it actually works the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy griffin dunne are really the best parts of the movie as said probably the only reason that this was hit was because of the special effects while they are still impressive today they are not impressive enough or plentiful enough warrant watching this and since they are more or less the highlight of the there are far better choices out there if you want scary movie curl up your sweetheart watch actually the sequel an american werewolf in paris is more entertaining since it does not take itself as seriously and actually provides few more laughs along the way,0.0
capsule annoyingly unentertaining obvious and paperthin buddycopdrugsexywitness movie presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock have seen this movie already said as looked at the box art no have not even seen trailer for the movie do not even know what it is about but can look at the way they are promoting it and know have seen it already thought it is about these two cops and they are buddies sort of they are at each others throats lot but they really do like each other and everyone else in their department hates them ecause they are hotshots and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship and one day they are in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves really sadistic bad guy lots of henchmen who can never hit anything the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying and the bad guy is drug lord and there is witness and she is this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down only missed the bit about the badges the rest got deadon and had not even left the video store yet the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo smith plays cop who has trust fund and is thus not cop for the money martin is family man shades of the nowtired lethal weapon dynamic here whose wife and he are at total odds this leads some strained scenes about lawrences not getting any and some totally unneccesary bits him skulking around his own house thinking his partner is now his wifes back door man not funny tiresome bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence will smith is natural and am happy see him in movies like six degrees and men in black he is funny and charming without trying be he really does seem be enjoying himself martin lawrence is different story he is so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are trial movies like this are not about originality know this they are about style and energy and synergy between actors know this too and yet while watching bad boys its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography felt fed up would seen con air despite being completely implausible was still great fun because it tried however feebly put some new life into the mix bad boys is dry run and overlong too clocking in at just over two hours lot more byplay than felt could be justified could write this movie you could write this movie many people have many people will continue write this movie over and over again other people will buy it from them and make it and we will pay money see it more the fools we all in terrifyingly prescient line from his book scanner darkly phil dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger as he called it would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth each other the same could be said about this movie have the sinking feeling we are going see it again soon,0.0
in the first death wish movie mildmannered new york architect paul kersey played charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife in the second he was avenging his daughter in the third he instigated small war in order avenge the old friend fourth movie on the other hand begins kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life his girlfriend karen played kay lenz however since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going happen the people kersey cares for this time karens teenage daughter dies of crack overdose and kersey is forced return his old vigilante ways kerseys new targets unlike the previous movies are not the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and wellconnected drug dealers even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan white john ryan determined avenge the drugrelated death of his own daughter whites plan is make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them the plan begins take shape but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teckoh fourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade however although some critics might argue death wish the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the is still being dumbed down mediocre script and charles bronson really does not feel the need put much effort in his acting however the hand of veteran director lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring there are some attempts for the movie have plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is potentially interesting plot twist at the end the script even tries fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenzs character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many products in next few years there are even some halfhearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in scene where kersey assassinates mob figures wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons classics special note xphiles mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the files could be seen in small role of cannery lab foreman,0.0
i have never written review for movie have not watched all the way through but had make an exception powder was about fortyfive minutes into this one at friends house when he and his brother got into huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house so never got finish the movie and am sure as hell not going pay three more bucks watch half of bad movie but can at least get partial review out of it because saw enough know this one was not worth finishing in the first place the movie centers around freaky teenager who is spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house when grandpa dies taking his department store down him social worker mary steenburgen has take powder first and middle names gold bond state home where we find out he is different from the other kids actually we find out he is different when we first see him because he is the most pale individual we have ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says he is not my son obviously all want know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago so the whitefaced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids that is until they try haze him during his first cafeteria lunch making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass decisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers draw all the silverware in the room into giant pile in the middle of the table so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spaceks carrie character and you have factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence your q test went straight off the chart and attracts electrical power this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if he is such genius already why would he need high school education and sits through demonstration in jeff goldblums science class goldblum plugs in jacobs ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powders chest but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in row following hideaway and nine months that is about all saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself but like said saw enough know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization none of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having beautiful woman fall in love the guys personality overlooking his personal appearance

this is the movie that could singlehandedly bring mystery science theater out of cancellation it is one of those movies that is so bad it is absolutely hilarious due in no small part its big star supermodel cindy crawford if you only remember one thing about fair game it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick the sports illustrated swimsuit issues if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from a you will change your mind when you see fair game ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition in real casting coup crawford plays superintelligent lawyer in jogging bra of course we all know this is stretch the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day nonetheless someone out there thought she would make good lawyer but we are reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in period of twenty minutes and for you horny teenage boys out there you actually get see her topless for two seconds in the dark come think of it that may have been body double cindy crawford is not black is she like said crawford is lawyer bunch of russians after her billy baldwin or is it stephen alec adam kim basinger is the police detective who has save her life time after time chase after chase explosion after explosion there is absolutely nothing original about this movie it is every cop show of the mixed every action thriller of the and every technology exploitation movie of the three decades of crap all in one place driven further into the ground crawfords complete lack of acting talent and it is all completely predictable you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going make before they make them you know when the sexual tension will finally end up in them consummating the relationship you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has rescue her in the climax and you know the movies going suck from the first scene the plot is not really explained until the end all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer in the words of one of the villains we even know what size pantyhose she wears yeah you and every yearold boy in america he goes on add we know more about her than she does _that_ find very easy believe hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes because wrote down plenty of other bad ones if it were not for me you would still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba because you see fair game is not only showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting but also some seriously bad dialogue it all adds up really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places was not supposed and grimace in places was supposed laugh one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief would you laugh at scene where crawford tortures computer nerd double entendres like am very interested in _hard_ware and other crap about playing his joystick would not but not because am computer nerd it is just not funny crawfords only contribution the information age are few gif files floating around her head on nude traci lords body or was it jack lords body will leave you the final line of dialogue in the movie the boat all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on life raft crawford says woodenly that was my clients boat you just blew up am filing lawsuit against you you are in big trouble or something that effect and baldwin replies smugly what do have do get out of it they of course begin making out and the credits roll am not going talk about how stupid the line is or how if they would really wanted go for bad closing line they would have had baldwin say you think could settle out of court but will tell you that if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game him or her you quote the final line of the movie that person what do have do get out of it serving america for over th of century,0.0

i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films when done right at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing but it is hell of shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle hollow boring romance that should appeal only the most gullible of viewers the ones willing buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance tom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively baldwins wife recently died and he moved seattle his son jonah seeking get away from the familiar surroundings remind him of his late spouse jonah senses tension and calls talk radio show tell the world about their problems sam seems ready strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out ephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it annie is happy woman she is engaged walter an allergyprone working man and seems be perfectly content but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing risk her engagement for it five years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still subpar romantic comedy you have got mail is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet at least that movie had sense of spontaneity here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely set up for the last five the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell but none of them can save the from being bore its characters are dull and empty its script is not funny or particularly charming the script has fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life walter pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen it is the kind of life decision that real people do not make and its major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice in essence this movies purpose is head towards goal that should not even exist it is ten minute short ninetyfive minutes of filler if you were show me sleepless in seattle and did not have review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia eugene novikov,0.0
if you have seen the trailers or commercials it is rather difficult really figure out what this movie has in store well it is hard tell after watching the movie as well bruce willis is resident of the future and it is rather bleak future the worlds population had disintigrated into mere and is no longer ruled humans but animals the reason in an organization called the army of the monkeys contaminated the world pure virus thus wiping out practically the worlds population in mere month bruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved scientists as are most of last living humans they barter his freedom sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the monkeys and kill him well this explanation did not come easy although the movie is very thought provoking of us as people our future and the evilo in the world as story it is very confusing and dragging know movie isnt keeping my interest when fidget in my seat or feel the need look at my watch only find that it is only been an hour passed terry gilliam has certain style that realize many appreciate and have not watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy figure out you wish it were more complex and not mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me,0.0

well heres distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually boxoffice hit at the time of its release after just viewing the for the first time my primary question is how did anyone an iq north of enjoy this movie it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as had heard it was at least some smut would have livened things up bit porkys tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want get laid women for the most part are mystery them and in this movie they are the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from different planet their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out smarmy strip bar named porkys they are able get into using fake ids after they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers they are played trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war on porkys porkys ultimately manages fail on almost every possible level as teenage sexromp it is not wild or amusing enough as comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat as look back at the it is something suspect most people from that era would want bury deep in grave and as revenge movie it is crushing bore one of the most offensive things about porkys is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the is about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in preschool that sure is revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction bob clark the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is be made fun of mrs balbricker is gruff noholdsbarred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex coach and barks like dog there is no way tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked do things in this that are not at all funny only humiliating prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is compare it other more serious films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison any of the john hughes pictures such as sixteen candles or the breakfast club put porkys at an even greater shame those films actually dealt serious teen matters but remained great deal funnier thanks their bright and truthful writing and heck if porkys wanted be teenage sex movie would take fast times at ridgemont high or the last american virgin over this any day of the week director bob clark is not bad director two years after he made porkys he directed the nostalgic holiday classic christmas story would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it was not for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down write such piece of garbage and think that it was actually worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually whole lot funnier than anything in porkys,0.0

review ghost dog the way of the samurai cast forest whitaker henry silva cliff gorman john tormey gene riffini victor argo tricia vessey isaach de bankole camille winbush director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch rating good shot stars languid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination the mafia and the sleek ultracool cinematic image of the hitman juxtaposing the samurais honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the americanitalian mafia it ceaselessly chips away sculptors precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaurlike function in the modern era director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts splashes of acidic wit using palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the he does not cater audience expectations of hypercolorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies the action is presented in flat brutal codas bullets have permanence death has consequences the movie rises beyond standard conventions become meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty it is an antimovie of sorts there are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience fall in love this is not that lovingly holds your hand there are dark contemplative moments and the firmly holds you the shoulder just so asserting itself for all see the fulcrum for the movies thematic balancing act is ghost dog mafia hitman twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is hilarious contradiction in terms unlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing he wears hooded sweatshirt he often pulls over his head giving him monklike appearance there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal he uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion ghost dog is disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of book he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai life consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books ghost dog lives as it were the basic tenet expressed his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead living atop an abandoned building surrounded his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends he craves nothing more as he puts it late in the have seen all want see he exists in spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings ghost dog was not always as he is presented in several roshomonlike flashbacks it is shown how ghost dog was assaulted racist white males and beaten nearly death until the timely intervention of good samaritan that samaritan being foot soldier in an aging crime family ghost dog pledges his life the service of the man louie tormey as repayment after years of loyal service ghost dog is sent louie kill handsome frank made man within louies organization who has run away the crime bosss daughter louise vessey ghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed louise whom he spares as she sits watching betty boop cartoon clutching copy of the book roshomon in bit of synchronicity louise loans the book ghost dog upset that frank was taken out someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out hit on ghost dog in perverse twist of loyalty their assassinated comrade the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up the light of new millennium many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint the reality of ghost dogs world each time character is shown watching cartoon it is from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc reflection of days gone near the end louise is watching cartoon that is departure from the previously shown ones it is bit of audacity on jarmuschs part that is nicely effective despite it is surrealistic nature as ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched two people one is sage little girl winbush who connects ghost dog through their love of reading she comes symbolize melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does films end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is testament his skill as writer the other person in ghost dogs world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares rapport ghost dog the vendor is the literal stranger in strange land jarmusch through rappercomposer rza underscores his rap and reggae music at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie ghost dog seems draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars in and of itself presents another paradox about ghosts dogs sense of honor the head mafioso is played henry silva stone faced resignation of all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world gorman plays sonny lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has quirky affinity for rap music love comically shown in several impromptu displays ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia he is husk of man assisted two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying whitaker carries the using what truly great actors use his face ghost dog is reticent speak often going for long periods without doing so the fact that whitaker can convey such wide range of emotion through gesture or look is remarkable talent although the has deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken ghost dog dragged the momentum down truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation the mob he reveals himself be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails truly adapt it what is real and true in his world carried on the shoulders of remarkable performance whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being characterization or icon into figure that garners sympathy if not bit of pity,1.0
i rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws for anyone wishing have the same experience would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety that is no easy task superficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance several other movies notably return paradise and midnight express as result nearly every review of brokedown palace subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons the consequence was nearly universal condemnation is shame as this is fine for those who have yet view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return paradise in my view if this is be compared any other source it would have be joseph conrads acclaimed novel lord jim problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced spend most of their lives in thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious setup involving suave conman shadowy criminal conspiracy and corrupt third world justice system the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale they are lifelong buddies who planned highschool graduation trip hawaii and then secretly changed their destination the more exotic thailand without telling their parents once there they find hotel and go sightseeing includes sneaking into luxury hotel sip expensive drinks poolside they get caught trying charge the bill the wrong room minor transgression will later come back haunt them but they are saved from hotel security charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill more polished execution of the girls scam he then proceeds separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene now alarm bells are going off among viewers the everpresent nick is too slick and his stories do not add up us the girls of course are too naive notice long before it happens we are anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fasttalking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sittingducks at the airport en route hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin just as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prisonbound for long stretch left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was willing accomplice for those in need of ready answer might suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girls fleabag hotel as one door after another their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation the noiresque expatriate lawyerfixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thaiborn partnerwife recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the films tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar pullmans oeuvre will find few surprises much of the remainder of the movie is smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in shorthand fashion lou diamond phillips for instance plays delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing be casually accommodating hank withholds vital information at crucial moments is he part of wider conspiracy an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the offers parts riveting courtroom drama prison story and potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful the girls interaction hanks investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tensionas does the foredoomed possibility of their escape if brokedown palace has major flaw it is its creators tendency like timeconstrained tourists take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only reverse direction halfway down and return the storys main avenue and if that were all there was brokedown palace it would not be very good movie but believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded for the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedomin all its permutations ultimately the other subthemes may be considered window dressing young and pretty alice danes is an old soul wild streetwise teenager thirst for freedom and adventure presented as perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale cleareyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend she comes from poorer background has reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father whereas darlenes life is ontrack aimed at college marriage kids career suburban home middle age and fulfillment alices is uncertain unfocused and yearning one poignant scene in the shows darlene shouting across an open moat visitorsfriends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo tellingly alice is present but not included just as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come thailand the openness and delight on alices face does not read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begins an admission alice of her guilt in tape recording sent hank however unintentional it is all alices fault she is responsible for persuading her friend lie her parents sneak away from the safety of hawaii the perils of thailand try the petty scam places them in the clutches of the evil nick in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of films beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison dar of course is the willing dupe in her view confers innocence never mind that it was her coercion of reluctant alice accompany her hong kong placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate dar is innocent it does not matter alice is the subject of this movie she and her journey toward personal freedom along the way we are treated an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture created these girls their halfbaked sensibilities and materialistic goals in the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dars father man who knows how grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girls tragedy thailands culture contrary most opinion comes off much better comparison it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes believe the filmmakers view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior the thai the sole exceptions of corrupt official and spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true their principles the girls were shown be treated no better but certainly no worse than the nativeborn their prison in stark contrast the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic as for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the films penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them in the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned an entire nation roam without the latter but freedom seldom comes without price is why the movies other tag lines are what is your dream and how far would you go believe could make good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not films end is alice she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact kate beckinsales character might more properly be likened the released temple bird referred twice during the trained fly back its cage as the thai magistrate observed in the films climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself if one thinks back over the movie character was transformed their experiences increasingly the cinema landscape seems have become littered endless permutations of kung fu womanfemale characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures here at last is the story of modern heroine in reading the many users comments was struck what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors think about that when was the last time you came away from motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it do yourself favor rent brokedown palace and watch it open mind there is more there than meets the eye,1.0

in october of audiences were dazzled the horror surprise hit know what you did last summer the went on gross over million dollars in the s and even developed cult following much like the previous years million dollar grossing scream when the trailer hit theaters in september attached urban legend it looked like wonderful followup did it live up the first the answer is no jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james survivor of the serial killer that attempted kill her and her friends year before she has been so upset since the incident nightmares haunt her all over the place but she has move on she know attends college and is best friends funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying hook julie up will benson played newcomer matthew settle karlas boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played soul foods mekhi phifer freddie prinze jr also returns as ray julies boyfriend from year ago one morning julie and karla are called up local radio station who are offering four tickets the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil of course they answer it correctly and they are off the bahamas julie wants ray come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead help boost her plan of hooking him up julie after they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island it starts off as the weekend of their dreams something just had come mess up the one carefree weekend of julies life though ben willis muse watson is back and he is not letting anyone survive this time will ray come the rescue before he can kill them off one one jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances brandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature you could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible survive matthew settle and freddie prinze jr are completely different story let us start settle matthew is completely fake in this you could not believe word coming out of his mouth you could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one is not as good as the first one he does do good job towards the end but that does not clear up the scars he already left on the freddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was he is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place we do not see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place the plot of still know turns out be pretty good one at the end of the movie like where the filmmakers went this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been bit better the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful there are lot of very nice shots around their hotel the sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first films jennifer love hewitts song how do deal is also played for about thirty seconds still know what you did last summer is nothing compared the first the first was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes the last fifteen minutes of still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first before this part in the there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares that is okay though because the is still very much fun and there are few suspenseful scenes think the reason this was not as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident he made them suffer for what they did in the second ben willis just kills anyone he feels like he does not stick ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after he had go after karla will and tyrell if the characters he stalked were in some relation the incident that went on when he was ran over julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made lot more sense the bottom line not disappointment but third in the series would be out of hand,1.0

i have never been huge fan of jeff bridges but loved him in the big lebowski the part of jeff the dude lebowski was reportedly written specifically bridges in mind and the fit is perfect the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles hippie slob on bowling team soft spot for white russians he is enjoying leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding be paid for the money his wife owes after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy but not before they urinate on his rug the dude assumes that these collection agents were after another jeff lebowski famous millionaire who also lives in a so he goes meet his namesake ask for enough money replace his rug the millionaire refuses but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped he wants the dude act as gobetween for the kidnapers dude and his friend walter john goodman take on the task and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers millionaires high schoolers nihilists artists pornographers thugs and league bowlers comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres so take my recommendation as you will for me the big lebowski is very funny it is an incredibly successful comedy the ratio of laughs intended jokes much higher than in most films not only are the two leads bridges and goodman funny separately and together but each supporting character is refreshing comic figure all the characters end up as the butt of jokes but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived each person may be comic caricature but there is always respectful selfacceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension the characters are firmly established and they never change their behavior for quick cheap laugh it is not what they do that is funny it is who they are is why the acting is so important and so successful in this movie worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus that is jeezus not haysoos the greaser bowler who is in lusty marriage the game julianne moore as the postpostfeminist artist whose work has been described as vaginal steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored teammates dude and walter and sam elliott as the rambling longwinded narrator aside from the performances what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue people lose trains of thought they interrupt they boast they repeat themselves they repeat their friends they sound natural taken fargo the coen brothers last it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers ethan coen is not just good at directing actors he is also good at technical directing he and cinematographr roger deakins created beautiful world on perhaps beautiful is the wrong word nihilists carpetpissers and thugs are not objects of beauty but the bowling photography and series of vikingbowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on all around the big lebowski is great solid comedy outstanding acting writing direction and photography all combine make this great comic success,1.0
synopsis captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend peaceful community of the baku from the evil admiral dougherty and ruafro the enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities of the baku homeworld lt worf grows pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores baku chick riker shaves while sharing bubblebath troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts comments star trek the next generation was hugely successful sequel tv series star trek science fiction series developed devoted fan following in the even though it still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original star trek cast in paramounts franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise star trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third focus on the star trek the next generation crew star trek insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good after star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek franchise do not wish spend this review comparing insurrection the eight other trek movies most people reading this probably have not followed star trek anyway so comparison would seem tedious at best let me thus make my comparisons briefly so that it is out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrections comic tone may be best compared star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie okay let us move the movie itself star trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanitys exploration and colonization of space lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners this combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy much of this appeals trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew audiences unfamiliar trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times star trek insurrection begins scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld forget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show this tranquility however is broken data an android who reveals the baku that they are being secretly monitored the federation and their alien allies the sona it seems that this world is veritable fountain of youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in young healthy state the enterprise crew led captain picard investigates datas actions and uncovers conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral relocate the baku and plunder the planets youthrestoring properties sound pretty heavy it is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined the films constant barrage of humor when going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece him this is supposed be cute and humorous in much more funny sequence work grows large pimple on the side of his nose as result of his exposure the baku homeworld pimple his crewmates try as they might cannot avoid looking at the acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good since they have been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers moral speech picards trademark his usual aplomb brent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar the routine from the tv series the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good despite many other critics negative opinions murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus plays the major villain ruafro well enough ruafro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the version of dune like the baron ruafro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled servants in one particularly memorable scene ruafro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds ruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations okay promise no more comparisons donna murphy must also be noted as baku woman anij who picard falls in love murphy is not young woman supermodel body she is mature woman an attractive countenance this is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted in fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here particular plot point involving anijs ability slow time down an ability she shares picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie for as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing they proved adequate sometimes barely for s mainstream science fiction but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace trailer reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on completely unconvincing interior of satellite the new enterprise itself only seen in this and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior does not look quite right for reason cannot explain despite star trek insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects enjoyed the it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though do not get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully would recommend insurrection as matinee for saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general rated pg cannot see this being objectionable the viewing audience young or old,1.0
us critictype people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies are not thrill rides but think that back the future ii is one of the few exceptions if the original had the spirit of the then this has the spirit of the full of fights chase scenes cliff hangers special effects some detective work and of course the vision of the hightech future the picks up exactly where the first left off doc lloyd marty fox and jennifer elizabeth shue travelling years into the future because something bad is going happen marty and jennifers kids doc tells marty he must take his sons place at an incident that will cause chain reaction if marty mcfly jr says yes griff wilson in one of four different roles whoever said history tends repeat itself was not joking especially when it comes the movies essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the takes place again in the year but it is not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously parody of itself at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better and it seems like everythings copasetic right wrong since when do things go according plan in the back the future movies there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story will not even bother list them all basically we get see marty as an old man his house his family etc we also go back an alternate and then back again everything happening so fast the never stops catch breath the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back the first movie and shows lot of the action that occurred from another angle it is difficult convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail the only thing sacrificed in this is the suspense instead of grand finale we get lots of little victories the end everything is back normal but something happens that leads yet another sequel but it does not seem gratuitous back the future part ii is really great adventure movie it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor,1.0
magnolia left me relling from the theatre staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft at nearly three and half hours magnolia will strike some as brute of it not only demands your attention but challenges you grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions it is delirious depressing heady pretentious surreal filmmaking it is also movie that will polarize its viewers director paul thomas anderson takes talented cast wraps them in net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in symphony of despair whose song does not let up until an oddly exhilerating biblically influenced pseudoclimax the characters make up modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in they live their lives there is frank mackey tom cruise slithery snake charmer of men whose search and destroy seminars teach how mentally rape woman get into her pants there is earl partridge jason robards dying media tycoon yearning make amends for lfe of callousness finding his estranged son there is game show host jimmy gator phillip baker hall self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than few secrets from his public and there is police officer jim kurring john reilly who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system perhaps masking man who needs rules fuel his decision making process given equal weight are stories involving cokeaddled emotional cripple melora walters former tv quiz show champion william macy materialistic adulterous wife julianne moore child jeremy blackman victimized mentally abusive parent and caring empathetic nurse philip seymour hoffman hovering over all these characters is cloud of death lies and despair it is not pleasant movie there is not one bad note in the acting it is affecting and layered and wonderful there is moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films then he tops himself mesmerizing deathbed scene walters plays her character redeyed rawness and fierce selfdestructiveness that is anxiety inducing robards convincingly portrays fading whisper of man who still hears lions roar when he speaks director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude emote the problem is that he stays on them too long julianne moores character linda quickly escalates frenzied pitch of guilt tears screaming and remorse and never backs off from it after few hours it turns from interesting chinese water torture quite few scenes such as the game show go on just bit too long and will be offputting for those used pat minute where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around and just what is the theme alienation hopelessness anderson challenges you draw your own conclusions and he does not make it easy the starts showing three strange and seemingly unrelated events it is harbinger of the synchronicity come at times different stories reach reach key moments at the same time other times stories seem veer off into uncharted territory regardless of what else is happening anderson is audacious enough even have group sing in the middle of the what is surprising is that it mostly works if you have doubts about andersons intentions will ask you pay attention the final frame despite all the sturm und drang magnolia ultimately speaks mans capacity for hope and attempts at redemption despite magnolias needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur showing off fro the masses have admire his guts this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling my rating bulleye stars side note helping anchor the is perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann her lyrics often add depth scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful when she sings save me at the end it enhances the yearning felt the characters just as wise up mirrors the anguish felt all as they contemplate their lives,1.0

in the wake of the smashing success of rumble in the bronx it is looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii the version have is copy from the laserdisc it is widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled as are most hong kong films these days availability over here in the united states is very limited these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng the subtitling on the copy have is slightly hard read the letters are white and bit small although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed this review is of the subtitled version so please keep that in mind if you are reading this review help you decide whether go out and see it be fair must admit that have never been very fond of periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past perhaps it is because most of those have seen were filmed on inferior stock either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling or perhaps it is because their plots all tend be very similar each other and in many cases all but nonexistant in fact many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem forget their main plot entirely until only few minutes before the end or for that matter it might be because the jackie chan films more modern settings armour of god rumble in the bronx etc tend have more spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts having said that must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is remarkable exception all or most of the above is one of the better martial arts films have seen and quite enjoyed it surprised well so was drunken master ii is about young man named wong feihong played jackie chan who is master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu where he learned this style is uncertain as his father wong keiying ti lung is steadfast in his opposition feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu apparently feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan is for americans but have heard very little about this and could quite well be wrong so will leave analysis of that the people who know it better one of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the once upon time in china movies but have not yet seen those the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy as are the plots many such films but if you are watching jackie chan odds are you are not expecting something on the order of war and peace the story seems revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics and hence chinas cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating up chinese workers in nearby steel mill however this plot merely serves as framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten up evil foreigner thugs the macguffin that drives the plot is precious antique jade imperial seal is being taken away the evil foreigners in the beginning feihong accidentally steals it while trying recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for customer in the process he clashes another thief who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead the ginseng after feihong narrowly avoids getting caught the seal the evil foreigners lackies thanks some timely intervention generals son cameo appearance andy lau who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt come up replacement for the missing ginseng and so it goes and the plot thickens later on such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into kung fu match rival or when feihong and the thief now revealed be loyalist manchu officer trying recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners are attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition but think have already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves let us move on the real draw of jackie chan movies the action there is plenty of martial arts action be found in this movie of course in kung fu that is be expected however this is not just another kung fu movie this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan is genius the primary martial arts style featured in the is drunken boxing form of kung fu attempts draw the adversary off his guard making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk further for the purposes of this at least drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated but there is fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into stupor under normal circumstances the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pulls it off flair the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless try describe it on paper so will just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work even without motor vehicles well not counting train there are some remarkable stunts in this among other things jackie dives off balcony into table and crawls across hot coals not once but at _least_ twice if you count the outtake shown during the credits quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database unlike in american films these stunts are _not_ faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble in the bronx the performances are firstrate especially when it comes the comedy parts of the the scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious as is the scene where feihongs mother having just revealed that she is pregnant is threatening hurt herself in order draw her husbands anger away from feihong jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into sort of mastery over the years and he is in fine form all through drunken master ii as far as cinematography is concerned it certainly works for this it is nothing spectacular but is at least dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the the picture is crisp and clear one thing find particularly worthy of mention is that at least in the copy have the screen was wider than any have ever seen on videotape beforealmost whole of the screen was blocked out above and below watch this on bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can it will be an utter shame if this is eventually panandscanned for american video release drunken master ii shows the full potential of period piece kung fu movies and it is good enough overcome even my usual distaste for such movies the plot does meander bit but that is be expected in this type of if you like this kind of movie you will love this movie and if not well give it chance anyway if nothing else the martial arts and stunt sequences are themselves worth the price of admission or rental,1.0
at first glance three kings looks be just another war movie the version of all those favourite war movies names cannot remember the version it definitely is just another war movie not in your dreams imagine pulp fiction approach saving private ryan thats three kings for you believe it or not it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter the story brings us the twilight of the gulf war the allied troops victorious majpr archie gates clooney leads an enterprising bunch of grunts rather unorthodox postwar looting spree the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away saddam in desolate village in the desert as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready be shipped home this wild bunch goes awol on an armed humvee the vehicle of choice of the us army they soon find out that they have much resistance as they get tangled the local rebellion against saddams forces frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men they become consciously attacked their own morals as the begins roll it seemed have rather light mood it special effects such as when gates describes his men how bullet can kill simply paves the way for lighthearted funny action movie three kings is much smarter than that as the conflict becomes more and more complex the audience will be trapped in limbo trying stay focussed on that lightmoodseriousmood that the seem portray personally found this analogous the same feelings of the main characters involved in the trapped between their initial plan paved greed and their own sense of humanity this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant action sequences are not shot as your oldfashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs inyourface war violence they are carefully built generate tension just the right tight closeups and pauses right before the action starts not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style tons of them starring clint eastwood great performances clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have lie in the conception of this the screenwriter and the director three kings ranks among the best films of the year well for me at least highly recommended,1.0

director david fincher has such an eye for detail is very rare in these days terry gilliam comes mind as another one is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell story but you can use the camera capture the smallest detail and have it mean something but most directors seem go for action the slightest ounce of story so whenever director uses the camera its fullest potential the almost automatically deserves good review and when they add fascinating story it you have nearly perfect entertainment finchers the game is no exception this the game is one of the most interesting and complex films come out of in long time fincher has not made since seven his box office and critical hit defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever so it is about time he made another and what ride it is the game is not quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better overall the game could have used little more clarity or little more uncertainty it walks line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes lot of sense once everything is set straight unfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false however this also gives the frightening aspect the game uses the fullest extent the game is told completely from its main characters point of view nicholas van orton michael douglas is highstrung and isolated businessman he lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his th birthday the same age at his father committed suicide at in the same mansion for his th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas gift certificate crs consumer recreation services it will make your life fun again his brother promises as skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed the lack of informationsomething this businessman hates seeing billboard in an office he decides visit the mysterious company jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the signup process consists of psychtests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game is suited each persons emotional and psychological needs explains feingold one day nicholas gets call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around see what people can tell him about the company what he does not realize is that the game has already begun the phone call is just the first of many strange events be thrown nicholas way how he finds out that he is involved has be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive the detail involved in finchers shots is incredible and almost requires second viewing just appreciate the effort that went into them seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something he also has the unique ability make you look at exactly what he wants you compared seven though the game is light and comical because of this films sense of humor and selfawareness nothing can be taken quite seriously so do not try make much sense of what goes on in the game because it does not want you what does make sense is the final revelationwhen everything becomes apparent and clear if taken as it is the games ending makes complete sense but if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility perhaps that is the reason docked the while trying remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable create any real tension on screen we do not really care if douglas character lives or not because it is not believable the ending requires you have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller michael douglas gives terrific performance as nicholas douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level his performance his character who is normally levelheaded and relies on facts is forced trust nobody can he believe the waitress he bumped into what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona the supporting cast is essential in this and casting was critical sean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother deborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good in fact she almost steals the from douglas james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation douglas predicament another good performance comes from armin muellerstahl from shine as the book editor but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come colorful life the game is rated for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs what is essential for this work is the writing john brancato and michael ferris have woven confusing and compelling screenplay witty dialogue and some very funny moments this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did however the visuals of the game are enough make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot and if you can get yourself believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained one of this years best films,1.0
originally launched in this popular was reintroduced in whole new generation of moviegoers based on the mighty successful musical from broadway grease was followed in the less stellar grease starring young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature roles plot highschool musical set in the showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds travolta and the innocent and pure sandy olsen newtonjohn from australia the follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song dance and humour critique funloving energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler this movie effectively juggles thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers admittedly am somewhat biased in this opinion since this blasts me into my past as rebellious youth grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection and the lesser responsibilities that possessed at that time but apart from the nostalgic vibe was still extremely impressed this as it continued amuse me despite my previous dozen or so viewings this took john travolta from dimwitted sweathog on tvs welcome back kotter and transformed him into moviestar of spectacular proportions saturday night fever in confirmed that sudden popularity unfortunately for the rest of the cast his popularity was not terribly contagious despite their effective showings in this classic movie on the down side some of the absolute innocence in this might bore or turn people off like when sandy sings about drinking lemonade and staying out until danny in summer nights and the plot is not exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created but despite these small reservations this movie carries enough great music and high energy keep anyone amused through its rapid minute running time and believe me am not fan of the musicals make sure look for young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights and do not forget buy the popular soundtrack afterwards so that you could listen its peppy tunes whenever you are feeling little blue little known facts henry winkler of tvs happy days fonzie fame turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want be typecast for the rest of his career both travolta and conaway were smitten newtonjohn during the filming of this picture conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest and married newtonjohns sister year later divorced after five years,1.0
set in the late at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book was also made into movie less than zero american psycho puts new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped create christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman high powered yuppie who hides terrible secret from his fianc and his colleagues it seems that bateman is serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting slip as he tries balance his meticulous daily routines slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins unravel was first introduced the novel when was still in high school read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due the controversial violence in it as usual when anything is controversial try seek it out but soon forgot about the novel and did not end up thinking about it again until stumbled across it couple of years later at bookstore picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers the movie has similar effect but at least it is less cryptic than ellis novel for once has actually turned out be better than the novel it was based on both the book and the open bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems concentrate more on these excesses throughout the movie continues touch upon these things but makes more of point immerse us in batemans impending madness than detail things as painstakingly as the novel does as result the is immensely more entertaining lions gate seems be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma and here american psycho there is no difference screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying take novel about yuppies filled graphic violence and sex and make marketable out of it some cuts had be made the finished keep from getting an nc mainly involving sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the was unwatchable thankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut side note cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who after bateman suggests that she start making out female prostitute proclaims that she is not lesbian nor has any interest in it the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the writerdirector of the go fish and who also assisted kevin smith parts of his script for chasing amy is lesbian it is subtle injoke and it is one found be pretty humorous despite having rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos the real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman whenever read novel always try imagine what it would be like as movie and who would be perfect cast as the characters always had hard time trying decide who would cast as bateman but never thought bale would deliver performance as perfect as his ends up being say bale runs away the character is vast understatement and he proves that he is as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger one sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip be square right before burying an axe in coworkers head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances have ever seen on side note despite the fact that huey lewis hip be square and pair of phil collins songs appear in the do not expect see them on the soundtrack release huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in rather large set piece in the much akin the use of stuck in the middle you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release am assuming that collins requested the same on similar note whitney houstons cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in scene comparable the other two and it is very obvious that it is not the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source apparently houston was not as open about the use of her song as the others were bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the do not look the book for any answers because it will only serve confuse you more several web sites have been dedicated the subject but am still undecided there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from scene near the end of the where bateman goes on killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff equal gusto the scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems be parodying as an example bateman blows up police car very cinematically after firing several shots from handgun in the general direction of the car kept waiting for bateman wake up and for the continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the offbalance suppose was the intention other than the few flaws have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality think this movie is destined for greatness as cult and deserves the spot it will take as such it may not change anyones life but it will certainly have an effect know will certainly hear hip be square in different context the next time hear it r,1.0
ever wonder what happened gabe kaplan you remember he was the title character in that sitcom welcome back kotter always trying help out the sweathogs frequently trying dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole so you ask where is he now mr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional highstakes poker that is right am not sure if it is his main source of income but from what have heard the guy occasionally comes away at time and there you were thinking was going tell you he was doing offbroadway theater you silly goose well gabe kaplan is not in the movie rounders nor is the about the actor come gamblers life but rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and thought that was kind of neat connection sorry about the segue or lack thereof matt damon plays mike mcdermott law student who also has singular talent for the game of poker he is been playing for while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug he goes all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how win in the beginning of the he is built up nice thirty grand nest egg he takes the speakeasytype gaming parlor where the big boys play mike is there make his bid into the upper echelon staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreomunching cardshark ties the russian mafia mike has the potential take large pot and go vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in single hand months later he is paying his way through law school driving delivery truck when mikes best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants pick up right were they left off working as team part others their betting cash although mike has stopped playing cards as promise his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life make about gambling filmmaker will usually have play up the glamorous side get the audience behind the characters this is because few moviegoers will care whole lot about some guy in leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at folding card table stogie in his mouth rounders however seems go more for the latter than the former the card clubs mike and worm frequent are not very glamorous at all there is basement lodge elk heads on the wall goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in director john dahl sets his shots except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities enjoy and are slaves it we are given nice set of interesting characters clear motivations and good actors play them matt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire play the straight and narrow finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ed nortons worm is truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they are worth john turturro who amazes me his acting range tones it down in this playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games make rent and child support payments he is both friend and mentor mike and turturros lowkey performance is totally convincing just as john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay prove himself martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors abe petrovsky while landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true ones self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward predictable ending perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just did not seem have much presence on screen she is genuine peach look at kind of cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and would not be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead good thing about rounders is that it does not get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cannot find time for humor the is peppered nicely scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game the next in widely different locales one game in cigar club had me in stitches love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys all the poker being played rounders had the potential be very confusing you might think you know lot about poker but think again luckily we are given narration damon during the more intricate moments explain what is going on the narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want do the things they do it is nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world as about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades wait as about the culture of cards rounders is an ace hang on packed great acting and great characters rounders is full house okay guess that is enough oh

i feel no hesitation in saying that there is something about mary is the best that will see all year from the moment the credits started roll at the end of the picture there was no doubt in my mind that had seen masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of it is that good of when gene siskel said this about fargo only few months into dismissed the notion as ridiculous how could you possibly know that is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it but after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork now know what siskel was talking about once in very great while comes along that is so daring so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end you just want stand up and cheer and you know at that instant that you have just experienced something very special now for the shocker mary is the grossest and most disgusting have ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding the movie is so rude and guess inappropriate in nature that had hard time sitting in theater watching it my parents luckily had seen it before them so could warn the about what they were in for forget blazing saddles animal house and even the former king of grossout comedy monty pythons meaning of life they were all only preludes the farrellys assault on the senses in fact this may even be the funniest have ever had the pleasure of seeing the only real contender is monty python and the holy grail and most certainly the most hilarious come out all decade but as funny as it is something also has be said about the overall sweetness of mary it has huge heart you see the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers they do not just present you string of dick and fart jokes although there are plenty go around they also very wisely add an unbelievable amount of charisma the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses it is funny though if you just look at an outline of the story it seems kind of contrived and predictable but believe me it is anything but ben stiller plays ted very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe mary cameron diaz after he sticks up for her retarded brother warren early brown the cameraman believe it or not from scream his dreams come true when she invites him the prom in one of the films funniest scenes something goes wrong will not ruin it for those who know nothing about the and ted is unable face mary ever again jump the present after years of selfloathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy suitably slimy matt dillon track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school healy finds that mary is still fullblown hottie and decides try and keep her for himself admittingly the basic story line leaves little be desired after all notreallyallthatfunny premise how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours somehow the farrellys pull it off the performances here are also right on target as ted stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm make his character not irritating as he would normally be but very lovable and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons but the actor who really grabs your attention is earl brown as marys brother no other actor has even come close playing mentally retarded man as much natural ease as brown displays here know he will not be nominated but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time hand out the oscar nods in february as good as the actors are though it is the directors movie all the way guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year you will see the number one space occupied steven spielbergs wwii epic saving private ryan and yes that is great worthy of the recognition it has been getting but is harder making great war or having your audience laugh so hard that they cannot breath for minutes at time will let you decide that one for yourself but this critic is sticking his guns there is just something about mary,1.0

one of the best movies have ever seen would heard extremely good things about this movie and though the previews did not really intrigue that much it was movie would been anticipating for few months now for some reason am not sure of this movie was not that big sucess over in the s it was definite hit the critics but did not exactly set any box office records after viewing this incredibly well directed written and acted movie cannot help but wonder why the strength of this is it is gritty realism the main characters are all human individual flaws no stereotype heroes you may not agree many of their actions in the movie or their approach life but that is what makes it so real had expected this movie be more of drama than thriller but was mistaken even the interrogation scenes moved at such pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase and the ending whoa have never seen movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly the three male leads guy pearce kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific the best actor oscar talk surrounding this should have netted one of them statue but there is one problem there how could they have chosen between these three actors there is no way could look at this and say one of them was better than the other two it is impossible kim bassingers performance is also revelation would never been big fan of hers before and always thought she was well what is the word twinky that impression has changed as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly the depth the story and characters is truly astounding no cardboard characters here the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences pearces interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant really cannot fault this movie at all was so glad see fellow australians pearce and crowe star in such breathtaking movie had been very familiar russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films but had not seen much of guy pearce intend change this next time visit the video store,1.0
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in whether it was the meddling of studio executives or the work of writerdirector james cameron himself the original cut of this underwater scifi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed the main problem was fairly simple the films climax was unworthy of its buildup someone at th century fox and no doubt cameron himself must have agreed because in came the theatrical release of the abyss special edition now available on video it seems timely reevaluate what in its newly revamped state is now nearmasterpiece despite its borrowings from films like odyssey two alien and close encounters of third kind the plot is thus we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed the hardnosed lindsay mastrantonio and captained her soontobedivorced husband bud ed harris the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of u nuclear submarine requiring dive partway down three mile deep trench three navy divers arrive command the operation led the edgy lieutenant coffey biehn but series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they are dealing as she memorably puts it are not speaking russian meanwhile on the surface hurricane is brewing and even worse series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous s navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig the triggerhappy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds the crew about how do deal the mysterious goingson around them the human drama is often riveting the principal players performing an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in camerons aliens the stunts hardware special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding and so they should be camerons technical credentials are well established but what ultimately makes the so gripping is three intersecting plot strands the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and exhubby bud the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as series of escalating crisis befall them and the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss the abyss special edition is an improvement on the original in two major respects one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay relationship at times touching at others incredibly intense and volatile the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the films end when the aliens demonstrate their control over water terrifying and extraordinary display of power world on the brink of nuclear war the inclusion of these startling scenes the storys climax is now given real weight why on earth were they left out of the original this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible so then we have minutes of additional footage that is turned decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent say quite because some flaws do remain the most grating is several moments of corny schmaltz some new some old that may well have you reaching for the barf bag nonetheless the abyss special edition now stands this somewhat maligned among james camerons greatest achievements alongside aliens and terminator see it and be moved gripped and spellbound,1.0

i have always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable death and taxes oddly have never given much thought either of the two maybe if did at least would stop getting collection notices from uncle sam yes let me make resolution devote myself better record keeping hold on all my receipts and do what it takes have the satisfaction that my returns are mistakefree and will keep me from incurring penalties it seems that the issue of death may not be so different at least envisioned here in this as this tender love story goes if you do good things and have clear conscience when you die you ascend place of great peace and beauty the dreams wishes and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true for those who die burdened soul however they wind up in that other place chris and annie winsome robin williams and radiant annabella sciorra seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has offer their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annies happiness and when chris dies after terrible car accident she commits suicide tortured soul who blames herself despair is perhaps the greatest sin and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity chris on the other hand has made it heaven and upon learning of annies fate he journeys hell find her and try free her from her nightmare this brims imagination containing lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell it seems that heaven and hell could very well be product of our fantasies or nightmares it is shape and look is as infinite as our imagination as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous he also begins learn more about himself certain questions baffle him at first why does his home in heaven ooze paint what is the significance of the asian stewardess why does he have an alltoowilling guide cuba gooding jr help him find annie but as he slowly begins realize the answers it makes him stronger and gives him greater chance save annie dreams is both visually and tellingly beautiful alas have one regret the movie did well gather more and more emotional speed but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying it seemed as if it was racing some kind of great finish but its intensity seemed wane in its final moments however your eyes will still well up tears and you will find lots savor the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed the journey is imaginative and was surprised how much enjoyed this,1.0
it was crazy time in france what the french revolution right around the corner king louis xv would soon die and his son would become king louis xvi such is the setting for beaumarchais the scoundrel about the controversial playwright spy and playboy pierreaugustin caron de beaumarchais beaumarchais was the author of the plays the barber of seville and the marriage of figaro today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas but back in when the movie takes place they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once the movie beaumarchais the scoundrel takes lighthearted approach its subject resulting in an inviting motion picture one of frances most expensive productions ever the movie was huge hit when it opened there last year now in theatrical release in the united states it eschews the seriousness of most art house films romping good story the secret of the films success other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzacs costumes has be the performance fabrice luchini as beaumarchais his glistening eyes and his infectious smile he mesmerizes the camera and the audience his wry little lips seem always hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning in land where court intrigue determines ones destiny constant scheming was way of life for the aristocracy as our story starts we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself judgeship into his court comes member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight beaumarchais who has been having an affair the mans wife makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided that over the fight is on luchinis charisma it is hard root for anyone other than him audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert in he played the attorney although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin played manuel blanc he dazzles the women and the viewers his grace and style michael epps warm and intimate cinematography provides nice accompaniment jeanmarc kerdelhues lush but realistic looking sets jeanclaude petit is music especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos make for an enchanting time at the movies director jeanclaude brisville who wrote the script along edouard molinaro fleshed out play sacha guitry according the press notes was just series of historic vignettes the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie but the actors smooth it over their goodhearted style typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in rotund benjamin franklin appears in large pot of hot water taking his bath one episode has beaumarchais working renegade spy who may or may not be man another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune aid the american revolution all of this may sound like dull historical drama but it is anything but the story plays more like theater of the absurd than movie based on historical facts the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marietherese the real love of beaumarchaiss life but he is so likable that members of the audience may want compete her for him still his beguiling smile one can never quite be sure if you should trust him the movie on the other hand can be trusted deliver high old time beaumarchais the scoundrel runs it is in french english subtitles the is not rated but would be an for some nudity and sex and should be fine for most teenagers,1.0
what surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away making him second banana the joker and indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy cast jack nicholson in the role he was born play nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops create joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the tv series on one hand nicholsons joker is extremely funny his murderous escapades and manic outbursts include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark but on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind the jokers cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister this guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it but enough about nicholson as the joker am sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman like many was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting keaton delivers he is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts develop the character keaton manages give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city visually batman is knockout nothing short of triumph for director tim burton and his production team the movie successfully captures the noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke burtons is feast for the eyes the million budget is definitely on the screen the sets costumes and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nicholson is not joking when he boasts wait till they get load of me his grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous keatons wardrobe is equally appropriate batmans cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop production designer anton fursts sets are wonder gotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york the batcave is cold bare and desolate the world that burton and furst have created in batman is melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption the movies gritty bladerunnerrobocop look is joy behold the plot on the other hand is not as rousing the screenplay is not up snuff in comparison the stylized sets and superb acting it takes forever for what little story there is finally kick into gear batman tries walk thin line between action and character psychology but it fails give us enough of either one as mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings in terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect burton seems more concerned the visual and dramatic elements of the story more than anything batman is mood while batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you its success at bringing life the style and spirit of the batman comic books thanks its distinctive look the movie like good comic book transports us another world,1.0

historical epic as genre was almost banished from in early for many critics scholars and most importantly producers it was thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects but in same as in the case of dances wolves five years ago there came the man who decided use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order revitalise that particular genre and same as in the case of dances wolves he was awarded for his effort oscars the name of the was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace in his time english king edward longshanks played patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression english knights although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played mel gibson does not care about politics and wants only have peaceful life his new bride murron played catherine maccormack murrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and together small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country through time more and more people join his ranks and in wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge but the newly won freedom is endangered the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played angus macfadyen who would not like have simple commoner as national leader braveheart was only the second in the directorial career mel gibson so it would not be fair compare it the better known genre classics directed david lean or anthony mann however even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach the genre the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism while older films set in medieval europe used give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood compared this naturalistic approach most of old epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour at the right places not only make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable sensitive audiences but also underline its downtoearth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics what makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as result character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero wallace is more than superior his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able show his sensitive more vulnerable side naturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain was the case almost every historical epic from in however even those who do not particularly care about history or are willing give poetic license scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of when scottish superhero manages seduce princess isabel played sophie marceau and make her child because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes are not as effective as they should be mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped small army of very good british and irish actors most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boormans general is also very good as wallaces trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol david oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce women in this have rather thankless roles especially marceau as onedimensional french princess catherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on from the technical point of view the is also very good photography john toll brings lot of scottish natural beauty the screen on the other hand the musical score james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times although mostly welcomed critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose be faithful only those related sexual orientation of longshank son prince edward played peter hanly he is not only presented as villain but also as one of the less competent in villains camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct make things even more obvious good guys in this are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals however although the message of this might look rightwing it owes more leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century according that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited fight for national freedom because their members has less lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots foreign oppressors in order keep their privileges this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety in the end whether the audience is patient enough discover hidden meanings or simply wants enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre,1.0
if you had chance create genetically perfect child would you do it gattaca is presents future where society has answered yes this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision gattaca came out only couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and this in mind the only becomes more frightening the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true contrary the misleading trailers gattaca is not scifi thriller in the way that there is lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes this is quiet sad about intelligent theories in fact the seems like it would have been written george orwell or aldous huxley the latter who is novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children it is that may likely become cult hit people who are frightened promise of shallow utopia is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason dug it so much the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke man high hopes but chance of heart problems and prospected life span of around years as child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired vincent yearns be an astronaut but when he gets job at giant space company it is as janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss but one day he finds out that it is probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of business deal brought out black market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in men in black life less ordinary who is client is genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled fortunately though there is no record of the accident and he is willing give someone else his life since vincent looks bit like him after couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job there he meets genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman who is genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin kind of relationship albeit very shallow one since romance is deemed how great mans stats are however murder of highlevel worker at his office is killed and one of vincentjeromes eyelashes is found the anal retentive investigators headed semiwily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincents long lost brother anton who has not seen him since they were teenagers we know vincentjerome did not do it but his older picture being posted everywhere not only vincentjeromes in trouble but also the real jerome who is as much in it as he is however there is not many big suspense set pieces is actually blessing because if they were tossed in the would lose it is message and descend into just being scifi thriller la william gibson the suspense in the comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just dropping hair or dead skin while there are several scenes are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the much the dismay of commercial audiences what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed the sheer beauty of sunrise rather than genetically perfect people and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident what jerome has done is fool the system in giving man who yearns for better things chance at that and the ending is shocking as it is definite work of dystopian propaganda but does not have the down ending of other works of this kind the production design of this is probably the best have seen this year it is stunning very pleasing the eye but still very cold since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into state of inhumanity and the sets echo sense of shallow misery and the sequence of all the highlevel workers doing their jobs has kind of gilliamesque feel it showing the nightmare of slipping into routine zombielike life the ability perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy the acting from everyone is great thurman giving wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating character who has been beaten down the system but has found new sense of optimism bitter man who was willing give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this and currently she is pregnant his child but the best performance belongs jude law who steals every scene he is in and creates character filled the pessimism over having such horrible burden placed on his burden think that people are generally tempted the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something am not sure of gattaca warns us not go any farther chiefly because we will create world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are and when see possible future featuring fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out,1.0

we all know the fate of childs play is the same for almost any these days that does marginally well financially sequel hell the newest installment in the quasipopular series currently out that would be bride of chucky and it grossed million in its opening weekend think is the sign of the apocalypse number five it is kinda fun go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago the original task is retread for some and for others namely myself chance see what all the fuss was about alas the original childs play actually is not that bad even seeing it in the tiny claustrophobic and mechanicallychallenged theatre at my college was not the horribly dull experience thought it would be not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd you almost need watch like this and if you do not believe me try and watch this flick yourself one day but because as whole this is not bad movie it is not great but it does have two things that many horror films like this one do not have rather nifty premise and sense of humor both save this from horror hell is precisely where say know what you did last summer has recently gone the premise of childs play is that serial killer named charles lee ray brad douriff is shot and almost killed chicago hardboiled detective chris surrandon see what happens some oscar nominees and before he dies utters voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into kids doll called chucky doll has got be the scariestlooking kids doll have ever seen the next day bum who is stolen it sells it singlemother karen barclay catherine hicks who then gives it her young son andy alex vincent for his birthday of course chucky begins talking the kid and trying find way get out of the doll but certain twists come up like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals him that the only way break the curse is take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll that being andy and soon enough chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun and people are discovering that chucky is not just kiddie doll one one the idea is neat one ripe for lots of comic terror and luckily it utlizes lot of that it plays an idea stolen from classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive they tell people about it but when he tries prove themselves chucky does nothing and everyone thinks they are crazy it plays this as well as the whole childlike thought that dolls and toys come life and even manages cram in couple really frightening moments even if there is an entire sequence devoted cliches woman alone in house hears noise goes investigate it and finds nothing but wait for the kicker second later there is also harrowing car ride chucky trying knife the detective from the back seat and then trying attack him when the car finally crashes leaving the viewer at least rather visceral exprience the ending is rather fun as well albeit tad too drawnout about four different endings maybe five and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror lineup making them easier sympathize if there is one horrible thing about many horror films it is that the protagonists are morons who you cannot help but shout obscenities at and for the most part childs play steers away from that and most of all the chucky character is good one not just because he provides instant comic relief look that dolls moving on its own but because he is generally scary character if there is anything really wrong childs play it is that it is too trite and has too less self esteem at almost minutes childs play features way too less be real classic of horror it throws itself into simple three act setup that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it were not for the fact that the deals psychotic doll if the had more confidence in what it was presenting it would really push the envelope and become even more than just short bit of horror escapism is precisely why this kind of is only memorable as cheap little horor is not necessarily bad thing as such childs play is content be just the short typical horror but saves itself via sense of humor and nice quasicampy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short typical horror,1.0

natural born killers is really very simple story that in essence has already been told in bonnie clyde some major variations in emphasis mood and degree both films glamorize outlaws in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers both relate the story of couple liberated love but where bonnie clyde was partial and subtle natural born killers is total and blatant where bonnie clyde was social natural born killers is psychological what bonnie clyde hinted at natural born killers confronts and explores what bonnie and clyde stole mickey and mallory kill examine natural born killers as nothing more than psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them expressed metaphorically as killing subdues the mysterious power this wields for the most part when mickey and mallory kill they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily they kill what is trying kill them they kill what dissembles and cowers from life they kill what needs be killed this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity brahma created vishnu preserved and siva destroyed but he destroyed what needed be destroyed make way for the useful creations of brahma the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate am forced say it for claritys sake plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes that is destroy the old plumbing system in order replace it the new one made of plastics your plumber bonnie and clyde mickey and mallory and siva are all productive destroyers think you could say without much of challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death presently and historically than any other phenomena muslims kill christians hindus kill muslims christians kill pagans jews kill christians etc you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged religion is an orgy of killing the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it has not been major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable the state is the divine idea upon earth hegel said meaning it is absolute allpowerful ineffable unassailable infallible authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh allah god etc well what does all this have do natural born killers let me first say that religions of this nature in the ideal take the place of sex consider the catholic church in its heydey took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken the pope cardinals bishops monks etc they forego the one in order come closer the other during the middle ages when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose power parenthetically witness plato as well in the republic he attempted launch the first systematic absolutist regime not coincidentally he was something of mystic himself regularly assailing the passions catholicism as policy attacks the passions as evil it sees intercourse only as means perpetuate the species not as way pleasure masturbation is considered sin the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution this is religion this is authoritarianism in its essence as further evidence the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters our culture most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years we cannot help but adopt even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes leading destructive split between the biological and social self mickey and mallory knox internalized them too then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them the presence of the other discovered them and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves it is straightforward liberation through sex as some good patriarch once observed you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on mm had vision of what the world would be like without contradictions they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions the moment of realization is worth thousand prayers as mickey says as the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency the matter let us look each other in the face we are hyberboreanswe know well enough how remote our place is neither land nor water will you find the road the hyberboreans even pindar in his day knew that much about us beyond the north beyond ice beyond deathour life our happiness we have discovered that happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth who else has found it the man of today do not know either the way out or the way in am whatever does not know either the way out or the way in so sighs the man of today this is the sort of modernity that made us illwe sickened in lazy peace cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives everything because it understands everything is sirocco us rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such southwinds as far as can tell this is what the movie has say its alleged critique of the media is only secondary tertiary quaternary subsidiary for sure for example wayne gayles first report ends some gen dude saying if were mass murderer would be mickey and mallory in his most excellent bill and ted voice on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical impressionable gen dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at subconscious level recognizing what mm were up and confessing that if he had the balls be so honest himself he would be just like them killing and destroying what deserves it let me exemplify what have been saying analyzing scene from the namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant kills him and then castigates him for giving her the worst fuckin head have ever had in my life now never claimed that mickey and mallory had perfect relationship because demonstrably they did not and this scene and the ones leading up it show us this sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations but unwilling kill each other since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation they must kill in place of their lever it is no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey as the attendant approached he took on mickeys character in the eyes of mallory she needed kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love mallory upon discovery mallory views this as betrayal judges him and commutes his sentence on someone else the style of the movie is whole nother matter that will not get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of western shots that linger forever on salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle the rapid succession of all those mm mm mm images from various perspectives soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills skittish frenetic mood also jungian archetypes abound these cannot help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely few frames some of the best scenes and lines that come mind quotes are paraphrased only mickey mallory one of these days am gonna be cummin for you in prison while mallory jacks mickey off semen is symbol for great potential and things come at the time they have not yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet the two of course go hand in hand for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs mickey during his marriage mallory as creator of my universe pronounce us man and wife the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting but telling too it reveals mm are well on their way expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them positive ones this is what mickey means creator of my universe he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes it is not necessarily schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears scagnettis first meeting mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendants mouth the indian sage releasing mallorys father who was reincarnated as snake old man go be snake after telling his snake story that ends bitch you knew was snake after mickey shoots this sage death during bewildering nightmare mallory says you killed life this is another telling quote because it implies they did not see themselves as killers of life then what were they killing up that time in some case just those zombies faking their way through life the living dead as it were in other cases all the antilife forces the cops and their parents the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison it of course symbolizes rebirth dr emil reingold as portrayed steven wright passing judgement on mm mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong they just do not give damn this is reminiscent of nietzsche is whole philosophy and maybe direct reference his beyond good and evil mickey the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth prayers mickey again in his interview me and you we are not the same species notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader no matter who it is mickey how ya feelin wayne fucking great mickey you got the feelin wayne am alive am alive for the first fuckin time what an incredible transformation this is he got the feeling and he could not contain himself what feeling that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe mickey when almost caught in dead end think think think think go figure it out dwight tommy lee jones in general because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole his whole attitude can be summed up destroy them,1.0

john sayles men guns is about what happens society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power the takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men guns are the rulers most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled guerrillas guns some are controlled army soldiers guns and all the spaces inbetween are controlled thieves bandits and terrorists all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only their powerlessness however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it the films main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive fuentes is true liberal caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians government assistance he has trained large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest cure and educate this program was be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was good idea however when he ventures into that same rainforest visit his prot s he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned as he travels deeper into the forest going from village village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other when dr fuentes asks village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we did not rational science and all its attempts cure have been wiped out the men guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized their loss first there is young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither mother nor father next fuentes crosses paths thief named domingo dami delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his selfrespect and defines himself only his pistol along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami alc zar priest who has lost his faith as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in he was preaching last the group takes on mute girl named graciela tania cruz who has not spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will live forcefully taken from her sayles two major strengths as director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but longerthannecessary running time is sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power domingos attempts control fuentes his revolver are constantly undermined fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is is not the setting is also as thick detail as the rainforest itself sayles knows how bring location life whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in matewan or contemporary texasmexico bordertown in lone star sayles is not particularly inventive director he likes let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain sayles also maintains strong sense of authenticity filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects the one exception is couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on few hundred miles south of the texas border it would not be stretch say that men guns is depressing in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure in addition loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure change anything through medicine or padre portillos inability

plot during week span in london in the fall of jack the ripper man whose identity was never uncovered committed five ritualistic grisly murders of prostitutes this is based on the graphic novel assembled theory behind the centuryold mystery critique awesome love dark movies love stylish movies love good mysteries and love johnny depp so yes really dug this movie the hughes brothers are back vengeance out show the world that they are directors be taken seriously and this movie my friends is very serious in fact it is also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell it as not for the kids will tell you that much and if any of those recent hack directors of twobit screamesque slasher flicks want some advice on effective kill scenes do not look any further because each one committed this is cinematic stunner especially when compared their generic sliceanddice contrivances in fact most of this films structure is very creative the actors all solid the atmosphere and feel of the picture remarkably real gotta love those unfortunates and the descent into darkness well honed the filmmakers you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come appreciate the politics of the time but it is also an impressive mystery based on the truelife tale of jack the ripper man whose identity was never discovered the theory in this is based on the graphic novel from hell written alan moore and presents compelling story despite being little oliver stoneish did manage tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely and present us an entertaining bowl of mayhem sexual depravity drug usage insanity murders and love yes the brothers even managed slip little love story in here and despite not truly being developed guess it could have been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already that is right there is no real need put any romance in about mass murderer but that aside you gotta give up the props actor extraordinaire johnny depp who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities center this movie all the way through sure he is just playing less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow but he does it so well and even added michael caine accent his mixed bag of tricks in this one was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this was sure that her presence would ruin this movie but she was fine and how little the dreamsfantasies of depps character had do the films development from what had seen in the trailer thought the filmmakers were going make this the crux of the story but thankfully it was not on the downside the does not really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development but then again story about the most mysterious serial killer of alltime is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement mean the less knew about each person the more suspicious became of each ones motives reasons etc in fact was actually quite surprised who was presented as the killer in the end and that was in part due the distance would been held from the films characters or am giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention perhaps overall this is an extremely creepy production glorious cinematography reminiscent of coppolas dracula and burtons sleepy hollow grim score and solid acting but it is not for everyone some may be utterly repulsed the gory particulars of these tragic events and even though the murders are not shown as graphically as you might think there is enough here send the squeamish right out the doors but for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style an interesting mystery and palpable gothic atmosphere and this flick is just that and plenty more and god knows that will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the rippers haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon brrrrr where is joblo coming from the crow dark city dracula jfk the nightmare before christmas the ninth gate the others quills shadow of the vampire sleepy hollow,1.0
in enemy at the gates jude law is gifted russian sniper made hero political officer named danilov joseph fiennes who uses him in propaganda newspaper raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad it is world war ii and the russiangerman standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland laws vassili is the russians top pawn victory lots of war stuff happens an older german version of judes character played ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings he is equally talented and the two men play cat and mouse game trying kill each other they constantly switch roles as the war fades far into the background the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as love interest for both vassili and danilov the setup is decent and so are the production values boasting wide range of grimy locales greasy hair and tattered costumes the art direction prospers the actors however suffer the problem matt damon had in saving private ryan either their eyes teeth skin or combination of other features looked too white and clean dirt and blood all around the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action that said the players are mostly good in their roles although do not think ed harris was really trying maybe he realized his role struck difficult chord in onenotedom while the is technically about snipers there are far too many predictable sniping scenes director jeanjacques annaud expects us view each tense situation jude and some cohort in tight spot as edgy and exciting but after about the sixth time in we realize that jude is not going die it is relatively pointless we get that he is talented okay let us move on that is the problem enemy at the gates it just does not know when stop witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere reestablishing his title as the most beautiful and often talented man on jude law carries the movie without him this costly production would have gone into the ground the story and acting are of good quality but there is never sense of authenticity or reality something about this war movie is undeniably modern and it loses its feeling strange enough the screenplay is based on the true story of real russian sniper,1.0
it is been good long while since we had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but it is been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths emerge so radiantly would saw that it is been at least couple decades even as far back the great hitchcock thrillers though am hardly comparing simple plan say rear window or strangers on train yet it is almost as good it is simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point plot point and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones it instead concerns itself the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral elegantly directed sam raimi yes the same simple plan concerns itself the discovery of crashed plane and within bag full of millions of dollars an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dimwitted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally do not flaunt anything they do not want flaunt they will keep it stored away in the custody of paxton the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse the authorities they could try fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or they could fight amongst themselves simple plan though borrows little from each of these little tiff the cops here subplot involving an alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit of inside feuding over here but as austin powers would say that is not necessarily its bag baby what most admired about this and what makes this far superior and unique thriller is that it is successfully able have its cake and eat it too it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have pay have what they think is happiness in black duffle bag so while steps are taken neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the choses never loose the sight that in covering things up the extent that these characters have they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity in one early scene paxton and thornton have make trip back the plane return some of the money so it does not look like it was all stolen not bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has do some major coveringup read homicide instead of quick murder and immeadiate handswashing raimi shows lengthy painful shot from lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries sift through his emotions and reach conclusion there is similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he is committing and taking in all the horror is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gutwrenching in short probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done but the hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof yet it also moves from step step in such graceful method that we never feel like the is merely stamping out the plot points of the story when the time comes for paxton start becoming selfish and thus diabolical aid from his pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating tragic heights there is at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they do not come masochistic delight but cringeinducing horror during the one was actually sinking into my chair the mantra they cannot do this can they streeming through my head in fact this is getting many comparisons the coens superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed the major amount of subtlety and restraint the directors direct what in other hands would be overthetop distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then again after seeing the evil dead films would hardly assume raimi would be able pull something like this off although there are moments of the are easily dubbed raimi moments rifleshot notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and characters coexist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches most particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob is brilliant creation his dimwittedness is often hilarious for most of the every line he uttered was greeted howling laughter but there is authenticity the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we are not totally laughing at him the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real jacobs multidimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much flaw but strength his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins make some heavy waves concerning the money the final third of the spends much time him and many of the touches upon his character not only thornton but also screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book the way are just great particularly admired back story about an old high school girlfriend told thornton such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance far the best performance he is ever given and further proof that he is the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you do not believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this had not been in the same year because he is easily able slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable he brings so much weight the that as it is most character actors it is difficult picturing anyone else in the role the rest of the cast is great too from paxtons declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows off her talents nicely and if had any complaints about the it is that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like cruel test on humanity that still pays attention the humanity involved and the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used extreme caution especially when you are trying set things up andor express emotions did not raimi watch the first murder scene and the thing that can most usually go wrong movie the ending is basically amiss will not reveal it but it is way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup as if the appearance of plane was not already too much of that anyway for that deals so much and so intimately the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending imagine charactercontrolled ending otherwise it is like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that am at all comparing simple plan dostoevsky the ending does work despite my protestations but me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as clam it then just ignore me and go about your day but despite my mere claims make no mistake that was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor is thankfully for this very minimal but because the places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things overcome that have frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece,1.0
some of my friends who went live in usa complain about one thing that country is very different from the one depicted in movies that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find their big surprise that the majority of people vote republican go church every sunday and usually do not tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american such rude awakening however can happen in another direction conservative people are sometimes forced discover unpleasant truths about world they live in something like that happens jake van dorn george scott successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions the rest of his community one day his daughter kristen ilah davis disappears from calvinist youth convention in california van dorn is worried because he does not believe that his daughter would run from home however the truth delivered private investigator andy mast peter boyle is even harder kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied the way masts investigation is going so he goes los angeles search for kristen himself unfortunately he lacks experience and the quest that brought him the utter depths of sex underworld is fruitless things change when he devises cunning plan and while doing it stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky season hubley almost two decades after its release hardcore is mostly forgotten critics and scholars it is real shame because very few movies in todays would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt in late it was totally different situation films were expected have mature serious themes for the mature audience for schrader this was nice opportunity expand the subplot of his previous work taxi driver one that deals the great generational divide that tormented the american society in on one side we have an old america that sticks the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great but that america is obviously unable cope the new challenges brought the social turmoil in and instead of facing them prefers live in rural conservative cocoons the new america on the other hand fares no better ideals of the socalled sexual revolution same as all other revolutions of the swinging sixties degraded into exploitation and depravity instead of being liberated baby boomers are stuck their own inability cope the newly discovered freedoms schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas actually are not so far away nice example is brilliant scene in van dorn already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist meets sleazy porno producer the latter one also turns out be authoritarian paternalistic and very dedicated this job the difference between the two is simply in the line of work many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda on the surface it may look that way audience is forced sympathise van dorn and his quest in the first scenes he is portrayed as nice family man who actually does not deserve experience parents worst nightmare the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel pain and humiliation brought oscarwinning actor george scott is of such intensity that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda van dorn is perhaps flawed and the subtle hints lead the unflattering truth at the end but the viewers simply know that his cause is just and that prodigal daughter must be better off her loving father than the sleazy pornographers that only want exploit her body on the other hand schrader who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns his own parents would not allow him watch movies until he was knows better and tries bring another side of coin even the people connected sex underworld can show redeeming qualities like nicky who actually tries improve her life and sleazy detective who develops something like conscience at the end unfortunately schrader fails erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning and his attempt reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich finale the script is slightly flawed and schrader as director does not show too much originality his style seems too influenced techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver apart from the scenes in grand rapids those two films even look alike but the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer especially those inspired the current revival until boogie nights no mainstream movie ever dared explore the phenomenon of pornography in hardcore on the other hand might serve as precious document because it depicts sex industry in the period often regarded as the golden age connoisseurs before the advent of video when many of the porno filmmakers could afford think of themselves as artists the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering though but for the whose main character takes time explain calvinist doctrines the audience that should not be too surprising anyway despite some flaws hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema,1.0
vampire lore and legend has always been popular fantasy element substantiated not only the sheer number of movies about the subject but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents and unlike any of the more outlandish myths the vampire holds some realworld probability one study claims bloodsuckers exist worldwide and places in los angeles but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys john carpenter would like remind us that they are and always have been truly frightening element of the thriller genre and remind us he does in his latest vampires there was some question as halloween weekend approached of how well vampires would do in comparison new line cinemas immensely successful blade released in august the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue and do not even agree on some basic points of the slaying method for instance blades main weapons are silver and garlic whereas main character jack crows technique is wooden stake the heart blade also gives more of face the vampire civilization while carpenter would like us remain in the dark about how the pasties operate both have their advantages and here carpenters style lends itself darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered when it is all said and done though the vampires still kill and die bloody flourish the level for gore is indeed set maximum this time our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow james woods he is cynical battleworn veteran and the best of his bunch he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest and after exterminating nest one night they run up against supervampire termed master named valek thomas ian griffith valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner tony montoya daniel baldwin and as the two regroup they learn that valek is the original vampire now over six hundred years old apparently valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of cross that will enable them walk in the daytime so the aid of priest named adam tim guinee and bitten hooker sheryl lee as bait they track valek down for the final confrontation the script for vampires written don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay see production all year crow in particular is fun source of oneliners and woods does every one of them perfect stoicism baldwin lee and guinee are all fine supports adding the character pool but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role and the only downside is that he is got talk sometime luckily he is got few lines and manages pull off rather thrilling performance all said fans will surely be impressed this picture and those who found apt pupil bit limp will be excited this one certainly worthwhile visit the theaters,1.0
if the current trends of filmmaking continue we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia although some products already use the last decade as background for their stories mostly in ironic way like grosse pointe blank and romy michelles high school reunion some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones until that happens would be remembered as the decade of greed when the revolutionary ideals of turned into its cruel materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had live in those times one of such movies one that probably brings the essence of the screen is william friedkins live and die in a the money is not just the symbolic motive in the it is the major elements of the plot rick masters willem dafoe is an exconvict who used his artistic abilities in order become one of the best counterfeiters in a being too intelligent fall into police traps and ruthless enough eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career masters managed elude law for years and became well connected richard chance william petersen is secret service agent adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed masters however his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another finally he sets up final sting but his superiors deny him the necessary money being frustrated and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich bill pankow he decides get the money robbing underworld courier their plan backfires almost tragic consequences when their target turns out be undercover fbi agent but chance decides carry out his scheme anyway like french connection one of his previous masterpieces this friedkins movie was inspired real life gerrald petievich author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay spent many years working as secret service agent that turned be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency not much utilised secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order bring the viewer into the decade of greed the beginning scene where the movies hero works as part of presidential security detail is nice opportunity hear reagans speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared almost any character in the movie willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber does not seem like affliction in the reagan years on the contrary those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable compared him and all the other side characters that want their piece of the action two heroes on the side of law seem like losers instead of being classical good guy secret service agent richard chance portrayed william petersen in his most impressive role so far is nothing more than lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement his sidekick who should serve as those better judgement is weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end in such surroundings of moral decay the not so happy yet surprising ending does not seem out of line although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered the dark atmosphere of a city of glamour and moral decay is nicely captured william friedkins directing skills the tight and realistic scripts memorable characters portrayed such capable actors like john turturro dean stockwell debra feuer darlanne fleugel and steve james gave opportunity for friedkin use another gimmick that made him famous in his masterpiece great car chase that scene alone lot of realism thrills and surprise twists is worth seeing the rest of the the soundtrack provided now almost forgotten band wang chung is also one of the more memorable of that decade in every case live and die in a is one of the rare movies in actually tries tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it,1.0

it might surprise some know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature debut blood simple grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas it bears some resemblance storywise the coens recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning end the premise of blood simple is really just slight variation on the standard lovetrianglerevenge scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires shifty private detective emmet walsh kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz things start go haywire when walsh decides instead fake the murder photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme reveal any more details of the story would be give away too much but what ensues is series of bloody and do mean bloody confrontations each triggered one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening every act of violence or deception in this makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes but we the audience are made privy the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person this aspect of the story along the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other death are the most effective components of the the coens might have done well title the fear and loathing in texas some have labeled blood simple as modernday noir but while am not an expert on either genre it seems more like horror movie than anything else the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive that said blood simple is very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when murder attempt unfolds in way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the that said blood simple is not exactly flawless for one thing the motivations for the killings are still little thin at times can understand that the characters had tracks cover or at least thought they did but found it little hard accept that all of them would so quickly resort murder and although they at least didn have anyone get hacked death knife the coens also are not quite immune horror cliches they indulge in prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutit isonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes the also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that found myself wondering if they had simply run out of blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem think it is but it is decent movie and it showcases the coens ability handle suspense and violence in visceral but nonexploitative manner would firmly recommend it all coenheads as well as anyone looking for something original in thriller,1.0
kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more simple glance than most can say pages of dialogue all he has do is look at someone raised eyebrow and you instantly know what he is thinking detective story features one of kirk douglass finest performances he stars as new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night the is based on play and this is quite evident as most of the movie takes place in the oneroom flat that the detectives work in the opens the douglas character getting ready go home his wife but through series of events he never quite makes it there the bulk of the movie follows the case of man named schneider surgeon who routinely performs abortions high fatality rate however this schneider character has connection in the past of douglass wife connection douglas himself is not aware of many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this secrets would not dream of giving away name like detective story one would assume the would resemble an episode of nypd blue but it does not quite work out that way however we do see douglas at work on few other cases throughout the running time lee grant virtually unrecognizable plays meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting her scenes bendix another detective provide the movie few laughs the performances all around are fantastic douglas may be the leader of this ensemble but he is not the center of attention all the time we get catch glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases brings me back douglas he has really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him we can see that this is man who has spent his whole life trying eliminate crime but has finally realized that what he is really done is gotten back at his criminal father how he handles coming terms this is something really worth seeing kirk douglas is the kind of actor we do not seem see much of these days he is tough guy but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior,1.0

the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year we are introduced blockbuster hits that are usually trashed critics loved the people and make tons of money at the box office this year the tradition continues an update on the universal classic the mummy have always been sucker for this kind of monster movies and always seem be the only critic who really likes them that tradition continues as well this fun special effects extravaganza in the mummy the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick oconnell he teams up curious clumsy librarian named evelyn played rachel weisz find the mysterious city of the dead hamunaptra evelyn loves egypt and would truly like visit the city that people call fable rick has claimed he has been hamunaptra during battle and that is why she chose him lead her there also tagging along on the journey the city of the dead is evelyns brother jonathan played john hannah sliding doors now in hamunaptra the three uncover the book of the dead the curious evelyn unlocks the book reads from it and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep arnold vosloo becomes alive and is out kill the ones who opened and read from the book along imhotep arising from the dead the ten curses of egypt become in full effect launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out find hamunaptra not only is imhotep furious those who awoke him he is also out restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt do not expect huge things out of the mummy but just expect have good time this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror beefed up special effects may turn off some viewers on the other hand this type of is one of my favorites but that is up you decide there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though the state of the art special effects take you into completely different world we are dazzled faces rising out of the desert swarms of beetles and locusts and even creatures crawling under humans skin these may have been in other movies before but not like in the mummy as of now the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year but all this could change when star wars episode the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country in the past brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles when playing george in disneys george of the jungle he was mainly not known anyone would say that gods and monsters is the that gave him name and now the mummy will give him name amongst teens in the mummy fraser gets play an action hero and liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle although brendan fraser is great rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast weisz really reminded me of character from an old horror the way she acts looked and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time evelyn is probably the only character that was likable considering that the other characters like john hannahs did not get much personal attention in many films when different genres are mixed the mixing usually works and like it for the most part in the mummy though not all of the mixing works there are some scenes that have lot of potential horror some potential comedy some potential drama and some potential pure action but the tries mix them together too often for the mixing work the mummy could have gotten an rating from me if it had gone purely one of these did not mind the corny oneliners here and there during action sequences but it certainly could have done without them the cinematography is amazing in the mummy particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt we are taken into very fun portrayal of egypt mummies and the treasures left behind the ancient egyptians the costume design in the is also up there the great cinematography from ancient egyptians outfits original troops outfits the costumes are always top notch the bottom line the mummy the summer is off its usually great start,1.0
jacques tatis classic les vacances de hulot also known as mr hulots vacation in english ought be the textbook on how do non dialogue comedy in the characters hardly ever speak each other directly and the operates on the paper thin premise that monsieur hulot played tati himself is awkward and clumsy and generally manages annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking weeks vacation yet the had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory part of the reason the works so well is the clever setup for the various gags slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy but think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash facefirst into pole so many times before you start wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people do not watch where they are going in les vacances de hulot the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively lowkey in one sequence for example hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when while his back is turned the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves washes away then comes back up on the other side of the boat while crossing over get the can hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it when he actually takes the boat out into the water it breaks in half but the two halves flip up against each other trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for shark fin and panic on the beach ensues tati does not waste single opportunity for humor scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audiences expectations and les vacances de hulot succeeds brilliantly in that area as well tati accomplishes this largely through sort of deadpan understatement when hulot goes into separate room during dinner and starts playing record at defeaningly loud volume no fights or shouting matches ensue instead the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room disconnecting the record player and leaving puzzled hulot sitting in the dark tati also uses running gags this effect allowing them keep running far longer than most comedy directors would more often than not we can see them coming and think oh he is not going do that again but lo and behold he does for example there is recurring joke in hulots noisy sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotels lights coming on one one then this image turns up again in the finale will not give away other than say that involves lot more noise in the middle of the night than car engine could ever produce the ending is one of two elements that really make this fourstar as opposed merely an aboveaverage clever comedy as much as was laughing during this was thinking myself occasionally that tati had top himself at the end really make this work as complete viewing experience suffice it say that he did the other important aspect is that the never seems disdainful of its characters it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him alternatively it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons instead tati seems regard his characters cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience like them however strange or irritating they might seem les vacances de hulot is not subtitled but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential the flow of events anyone taste for this kind of absurd humor ought make this their next rental from the video store note les vacances de hulot was not rated the mpaa it would at most receive pg rating,1.0

i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that did not need sequel beloved kids and their parents respected equally mainstream america and geekish movie buffs that first movie remains landmark of recent history the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game toy story was smash hit of unexpected proportions and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply it did not show and as distributor and partowner of the property at least it had piece of the action toy story was greenlighted as directtovideo project disneys standard tactic for milking few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing proper feature as someone who does not believe sequels are necessarily bad thing granted they usually are bad thing but that is because they are made for the wrong reasons had wonder what in the world they were thinking fortunately disney claimed have been so knockedout early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead theatrical sequel lucky thing too like the first movie this one is joy behold on the big screen and technically it improves on its predecessor on just about every level from business standpoint the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted pixar while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney sign of the production houses new cachet in visually the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly making them look little creepy fortunately that eerie unreality fits in perfectly the perspective of the movie where the secret world of toys is more immediate and arguably more attractive than the world of the humans who surround them as before the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of little boy named andy and indeed all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children come life in the childs absence while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves the real joy of toys life is mean something its owner one of the subjects of this new is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned left on shelf gather dust and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors most often those toys are packed away in dark spaces safe from sunlight and humidity and often they are not even removed from their packaging imagine what chip that would put on your shoulder and you will understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie sheriff woody voiced noteperfect tom hanks the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear tim allen suffers an injury early in the when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls seam apart revealing the stuffing inside this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys who know too well that broken toy is often forgotten toy and forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence those anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room collecting old toys for yard sale and there is an ironic twist the tale as woody winds up being stolen an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure complete set that he hopes sell japanese toy museum for sizable sum the rest of andys toys who owe him quite debt resolve rescue him that this manages turn box marked cents into symbol of doom or make its screed against the retention of collectible toys wrongheaded profiteers fuel for metaphysical dilemma is testament its skill at metaphor seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys operating on this level of abstraction toy story tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness the worst can say is that randy newman seems have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan who stops the movie cold singing it at just about the halfway mark sometimes think toy story tries too hard there is somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first allowing it surprise and excite on nearconstant basis and more philosophizing about toys collectors the nature of happiness and the meaning of life while that leads fewer bellylaughs it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion just do not ask why andys favorite toy is based on tv series that was canceled in where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn find it stocked the gills his doppelgangers buzz lightyear action figures forget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix this is fundamental mindbender for buzz and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight here as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character we see our protagonists come facetoface god in sly ways then toy story can be read as about mortality metaphorical consideration of aging and death significantly the films very first sequence concludes grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in nearuproar and toward the end when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys one of them observes an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking that it will be fun while it lasts so toy story joins the tradition of childrens stories largely neglected of late that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence what is really striking is that both toy story films and lesser degree pixars bugs life are kids movies wit and sophistication shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts not mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros animation am not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at

capsule the director of cure brings weird and very complex concept the screen one viewing will not be enough understand fully the premise of pulse the idea is something about ghosts and the internet the has an amazing apocalyptic style perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa his films all seem have one style bleak the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold little known in the us date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable deliver most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid his cure one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one conjure cure is probably his classic last year he released seance remake of seance on wet afternoon that was perhaps miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into nonsupernatural story pulse is kurosawa back on form taguchi young computer expert is late his delivery of some important software two coworkers go his apartment and find it dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software meanwhile he slips behind plastic curtain when he fails respond calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself if that was not horror enough the body seems disappear leaving just strange dark mildewlike spot on the wall taguchis computer seems have been infected some kind of computer virus people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially die via suicide but they are not entirely dead their spirits seem remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet people who get the computer virus are asked if they want see ghost if they say yes they seem be able see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist this is all somehow connected heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like computer disk instead the dead seem be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses there is some sort of passage between worlds having something do doors marked red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers leave it kurosawa find new kind of death this is that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the all work it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world some familiar and accurate computer discussion frequently the plot is advanced character hunches being assumed be fact his plotting is frequently hard follow and always very strange junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawas films creates dark cold and gloomy tone images are obscured semilighting or are behind plastic curtain scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might people are shot guns but there is little if any blood in evidence seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but deeper metaphysical dread of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one watch rate this metaphysical look at isolation on the scale and on the scale,1.0
when first heard that disneys next animated feature was going be tarzan was almost horrified was worried that disney was going make another hercules sorry jerkules that effort was too overloaded comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous be considered sympathetic hero and after viewing it this day find it disgrace for disney animation when saw the trailers was thinking hmm this is not bad at all this just might have potential when bought the soundtrack was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features have never really heard of phil collins nor have heard of mark mancina so was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin was pleasantly surprised the music is topnotch phil collins songs are terrific percussionheavy pieces of work that seem break the formula for typical disney songs the score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me bit of the lion king but it was more original so the soundtrack was not bad at all considering it was two people am not familiar this could be good but will it be when finally went see it on opening day as tend do most disney animated features my question was answered in complete turnabout of expectations for me disneys tarzan is surprisingly decent the story starts out tarzans parents surviving shipwreck and finding home on an island where apes live in peace however one day vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzans parents leaving him at this time baby aloneuntil kala of the apes rescues him kala wants raise the child as her own she lost hers previously sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it is not our kind he says he agrees though let her take care of little tarzan but that does not make him my son tarzan grows up vowing be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just cannot convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in battle one day new animal shows up humans this is where jane comes into the picture she is on an expedition her father professor porter and despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas tarzan rescues her when she is chased baboons and soon they get know each other even though tarzan falls in love jane this causes things go wrong clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them worse clayton has plotted send the gorillas london for money will tarzan find out family he belongs and save the apes am not gonna tell you sorry you are gonna have see for yourself and see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling the jungle tarzan lives in in fact it seems similar the computer imagerycel animation combination in rival disney animted films such as foxs anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals the casting is fairly good tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules nicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has beautiful singing voice too the way lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby bensons beast voice makes him all the more ferocious and gripping minnie driver had me little worried at first as the voice of jane thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole when first saw the trailers but when saw the did not have problem her take back my insult on driver it is nice hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disneys most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter on the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode ithe phantom menace brings pompous and later on vicious voice the sinister clayton he might not be the strongest character in the he is just plain bad guy nothing else but blesseds vocal work contributes greatly but if there is any voice that think steals the whole show it should be rosie odonnell who is hilariously funny as terk she also has fiesty attitude am gonna kill ya she says more than once almost sung along her during one of the films best moments where the apes make mess of the humans camp via song er scatting shoobedoo dabedah can see why she wanted have rock song for the she is good singer not that she was the only funny character in the though wayne knight who played stan in space jam gives whimsically funny style tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into unsanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuencethat would have killed the picture the songs as said before are decent mostly sung collins this sets new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing tolerate musical numbers from characters lot more than some other guys would but found this be nice change of pace the story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it strong dramatic touches makes this far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules if there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the sync version of trashing the camp from the heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going be was upset that it was not because had thought of taking few friends of mine who like sync see tarzan oh well overall was enthralled tarzan would not hold it high the way do mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my alltime favorite disney classics but this deserves high place among disneys greatest achievements give nod disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan this great animated adaption of egar rice burroughs tarzan,1.0
the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes and the greedy trade federation has used it is armada of powerful space battleships blockade the planet naboo we soon find that the federation plans invade the planet an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboos ruler the young queen amidala natalie portman sign treaty giving the federation control however the galactic republic has sent jedi knights quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor as emissaries the federation in order negotiate for the ending of the blockade no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission mysterious cloaked figure destroy the jedi and the first battle begins it seems that for me and thousands of people like me the love for george lucass trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time we are the fans not the freaks we will not go dressing up like darth vader although you have admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool and we will not incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations not all the time anyway but if someone wants challenge us little trivia contest we are throwing down all right stop looking at me like that we have been faithfully and patiently waiting waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started roll you see the trilogy is not just set of movies but religion of sorts we the faithful disciples and the phantom menace is tantamount the second coming of the messiah unfortunately it is not our savior for weeks beforehand was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good stupendously good miraculously good anything less and it will be the biggest disappointment of the century did not want the doomsaying prophecy come true really did not but this nevertheless fails reach the pinnacles of filmmaking character development is virtually nonexistent the possible exception of quigon most of the films characters seem left nothing do but go through the motions none seem very affected their experiences and few even show any passion at all contrast this the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected in the form of jar jar binks creature belonging race lives in underwater cities on naboo in precarious symbiosis the land dwellers led amidala jar jars life is saved quigon early in the and travels our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh or supposedly so his speech mannerisms are so cuteified that could not understand third of what he was saying and the slapstick he performed was just distracting his head gets caught in an electronic field his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast he describes being in trouble as deep doo doo and even manages step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport therein lies key difference between this and one of its predecessors in star wars we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was wretched hive of scum and villainy in the phantom menace we get doo doo the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in story long time ago in galaxy far far away this on the other hand constantly reminds me that it is only movie including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve jerk the viewer from the experience perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during scene where young anakin skywalker enters into pod racing competition it is kind of like chariot racing large engines instead of horses and there are couple of commentators in press box delivering indy like play play liked the pod race it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction this aspect coupled the emphasis on humor simply baffled me suppose one may say that lucas was trying appeal the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all did not millions of youngsters still go back see the original star wars in over and over again did not the action figures still sell like hotcakes of course they did and it is only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited in history be marred pandering children who would still have enjoyed more appeal for adults one aspect that will appeal broadly however is the use of special effects the people at lucass industrial light and magic the worlds premiere effects house outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage some of the scenes have be seen be believed especially the shots of land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen the space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts only subtle margins the casual observer this however is testament the work ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today john williams is back of course providing score for the as only he can his music is pervasive throughout as rousing and as dramatic as ever always serving punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately since this is supposed be the first installment in nineepisode story star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already in addition those whom we unfamiliar as result attention history and characterization was spread little thin it would have been nice get more in depth yoda and obiwan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters cover it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films one of the new characters is darth maul hailed as the new villain as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior this films release in spite of the hype darth maul is character almost did not have be in the his role is so insignificant he has maybe three spoken lines believe it or not second actor voices the character and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean that working against him he never has chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment lucas seems have wanted develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe something has been prominent throughout however he does so largely paralleling the star wars spirituality the bible offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back planet earth reallife connection oddly while trying capitalize on spirituality lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells this only serves demystify the workings of the force few notches offering scientific connection do not let me mislead you too far the phantom menace most standards is good it contains lot of visual treats sets the stage for an epic story gives us bit of excitement here and there and even allows us revisit some of our old friends it is just that when held up it is predecessors and not do so would be unrealistic this simply pales,1.0
in december of little movie called scream was released became boxoffice smash and resurrected films targeted at teens first it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over the teen comedy genre la john hughes starting last junes cannot hardly wait it may be the first week of april in but so far this year we have been given movie aimed at the andunder market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie and the mod squad coming april are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april we have got the teen satire election and the teen horrorcomedy idle hands jeesh out of all of these moves however the one that is most similar the latest incarnation things hate about you is this past januarys mediocre hohum she is all that although similar in plotting ok darn near identical things hate about you modernday version of shakespeares the taming of the shrew she is all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior in every department from the smart direction firsttime feature director gil junger the charming and wellwritten screenplay karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in teen comedy since the breakfast club and top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we did not have once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she is all that the day wideeyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordonlevitt starts school at seattlebased padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik although he does not know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller will not allow her date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles senior decides kat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out find someone that will be the perfect match for her is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger complicating matters camerons dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as pawn so that he will pay patrick get kat go out him and then cameron hopes steal bianca away from joey as you can see things hate about you includes huge number of characters some of have not even mentioned such as kats shakespeareobsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and biancas materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union at short but wellused running time of minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she is all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you are vapor since could sympathize the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained aside from good screenplay it is the performances that can make or break movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot aside from joseph gordonlevitt rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance date here none of the actors are that wellknown but it is this aspect that brings particular freshness the proceedings as the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the is marvelous and always believable and certainly has bright future ahead of her even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged it was easy identify kats way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality no one think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does heath ledger as the infamous badboy of the town injects much life into patrick and has lot of chemistry stiles one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able turn bianca into person multidimensions even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset in one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has one offbeat element of the and source of some hearty laughs is the way that the schools staff act is strikingly unformal allison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare the class in rap and at one point sends kat the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good although there are few cheap laughs that are thrown into the near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters in one very funny scene chastity asks know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed at another point bianca and kats father standout larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going get pregnant only allows bianca go the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it is like be pregnant things hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other of the it also helps that the movie has perfectlyassembled soundtrack mixing indierock new wave songs and thank goodness no rap the films end it actually had me rooting for certain characters get together and was also quite pleased how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in kat gets up read the poem she

in the stock market crashed and oliver stones wall street was released critical acclaim and packed movie houses wall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the resonation it might not of had and though its killorbekilled approach business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman stone constructed his as mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status that of contemporary classic am proud say that will never be counted as one of them found wall street be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stones output its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and charisma barren performance the young charlie sheen stone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works this approach tends bury his purported message beneath heap of good intentions he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode people shouting into phones as if they were in plummeting airplane it is all an excuse for stone ratchet up the emotion false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like have feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges more than anything am baffled why so many adore wall street the only possible solution can muster is its release date and not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the was plumped down in the eighties decade in the onejoke comedy rose an art form and group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies in my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as decade not only proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes maybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as welcome change of pace boiler room is an equally welltimed some similarities stones piece of crap they both feature consequential fatherson relationship though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching and they are both concerned the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin poseurs presuming be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street boiler room is message movie as well though at least until the end does not shove it in our faces boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees people will go for that cash as said this is indeed timely in society where who wants be millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about revolution of prime time tv watching that has not been seen in quite while not only do we want be millionaires we want watch other people become millionaires in our superjudgmental poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all and seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way he is wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him ben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like frat boy gordon gecko his job is influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees giving speech that subtly attacks their man hood it is ironic that he sells these pups the same load of s that they are told dish out prospective buyers afflecks character is obviously supposed recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental the actors performance affleck shouts curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge when alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing really hammy line reading the brokers approach their job the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm work like football players on the way the big game rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters they are not above rumble as test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager use his fists in minor disputes we drink up this world along seth and watch him become seduced it just like we might be as in all cautionary tales boiler room begins seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us the consequences of all the recklessness know this story we all do but it can work if it is told intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it as director of please excuse my french miseenscene younger has much learn his style is sitcom bland but his writing is not youngers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like junior david mamet despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes tense confrontation between victimizer and victim who is not aware that he is one the exception of afflecks brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional ribisi who has the edgy looks of character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth he conveys childlike vulnerability his character seems hide in corner whenever things are not going his way in some scenes and in others he is ferociously cut throat the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when it is just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played ron rifkin boiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences the sales build slowly like crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys those ploys are taught seth chris vin diesel kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor diesl shines in his minor role this week saw the scifi opus pitch black in diesel plays completely different role in an equally effective manner in that he has the kind of role that might have gone arnold schwarzenegger in the and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone elliot gould in the nicky katt is also memorable as superior broker obsessed what he cannot have nia long as the firms secretary lone black women amongst many white men is ribisis love interest in part that at first looks be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting the two make an oddly likeable couple long is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof at one point he says her am just lookin for some chocolate love it is terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way it becomes sweetly endearing unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns tad schmaltzy there is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares this is okay when taken in small doses but youngers conclusion is constructed as series of these boohoo moments one following the other particular misstep is his attempt show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims it is not bad idea but the execution is lacking those scenes feeling tacked on further spell out the message that message being greed is bad yes it is patently obvious but boiler room conveys it introducing us culture that have not seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur and all wall street did was introduce us simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners boiler room offers neither extreme it gives us what is in between and for that am thankful,1.0
look back at all the times in your life when there was fork in the path the future some sort of decision had be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence from timetotime everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different perhaps even more dizzying contemplate is how seemingly minor action catching the am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact maybe that is where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just few seconds later makers are no less fascinated issues of destiny than anyone else and that is why there is no shortage of movies about this subject the best of the bunch were probably made the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed questions of fate and chance these themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red however they are most explicitly examined in called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after minor action missing or catching train changes the course of his life in his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day we are faced choice could end our entire life yet of we are completely unaware while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in way frank capras it is wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy plumb its depths the road not taken approach is not just plot device either writerdirector peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of character after she just missescatches train the audience watches evergrowing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has family as her separate destinies diverge and then reconverge she becomes two completely different individuals that woman is helen played gwyneth paltrow as long dark haired brit one day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides return home in the middle of the day the scene of the pivotal moment is train platform in scenario she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station on board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah monty python fan who is taken her beauty minutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed another woman jeanne tripplehorn in scenario she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging she does not meet james and fails make it home in time discover gerrys infidelity juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there on one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as deep and wonderful experience but for those who just appreciate romantic comedy characterized solid acting script few twists and great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less it should not come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid paltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout she plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays gerry and the liberated platinumblond who severs the ties her old life and embarks on new career new man john hannah known most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and funeral is instantly likable john lynch taking break from movies about irelands troubles does good job presenting gerry as inept selfish philanderer only jeanne tripplehorn who plays an overthetop vixen seems out of place her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and it is occasionally difficult see her lydia as anything more than plot element one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice douglas mcferran who plays gerrys best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that he is in part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie on one occasion he has marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into life of monogamy on another occasion while laughing at gerrys plight the women in his life he comments being you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable but it is not all in the dialogue mcferran tears into this part relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of topnotch comedy this is the first feature for peter howitt and he approaches the task unimpeachable aplomb the script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into crowdpleasing whole sliding doors grants more than just good time at the movies however for those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having good time,1.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned east meets west in mulan the latest installment in disneys parade of annual animated feature films an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential though not for lack of trying in many respects mulan is among disneys most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat the violence of the battles in the are admittedly sanitized the imagery of pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of childs discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulans later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does animated long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such provocative manner in an instant idealistic mulans innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending the based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on spirited young woman who disguises herself as man in order serve as her familys obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack huns cartoonishly depicted easy demonic overtones replete glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth although lent surprisingly genuine sense of menace dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disneys new is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from predominantly asianamerican cast providing the films vocal work there is liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence while the does occasionally reach its limits and starts tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudoasian references items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and cannot imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karatechopping blocks of stone in two it is rather remarkable that movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory the also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately it is startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does unfamiliar youngsters regards the customs and traditions of mulans land at its core the is tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage as such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able effectively work handinhand visual purity scenes would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulans venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent sense of strength and conveyed greater emotional clarity in animation mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroines characterdefining opening halfhour it is when the attempts integrate the traditional mainstays of recent animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry off battle mulan finds herself being trailed jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief they are affable presences and not precisely ineffective

melvin van peebles sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song was watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement it was released less than decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees its subject matter van peebles black american who first gained recognition writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely himself because no studio would dare fund such he was forced raise all the money himself the movie ended up costing about part of was put up none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs hiring nonunion labor and taking on most of the films responsibilities himself he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the as well as starred in the central role he was also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way make an extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the dreaded xrating van peebles not only threatened bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated an allwhite jury he put on the movie posters help advertise the he also printed the phrase on teeshirts he had no problem selling the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character tough male hustler of few words who grew up in brothel and makes money doing what he does best having sex one day he agrees go couple of amiable white cops down the station make it look like they are bringing in suspects on politicallycharged case involving murder however on the way the station the cops arrest young black revolutionary named mumu hubert scales who they proceed beat viciously acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops the brink of death the rest of the follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way eventual escape in mexico although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets little old the end of the this plot allows van peebles camera roam the darker side of a the ghettos alleys and backstreet whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles entire point in making the movie was secure on celluloid vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph is traditional prologue used in medieval times when messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage brutality that the artist has invented but hymn from the mouth of reality van peebles wanted make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration of course todays abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode black innercity life as well as films spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback does not seem all that revolutionary it is important remember that this must be viewed in the context and time period in it was made at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it distributors were petrified of that in van peebles words gave the black audience chance see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass of course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered be the that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft and the mack because those were financed big studios sweet sweetback is also the only deemed mandatory viewing the black panthers however even if when viewed from an africanamerican perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter praise it there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away mexico is nothing be proud of others have pointed out that sweetback has little say throughout the he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives still others point the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in scene where he gains the respect of white biker group bringing their female leader orgasm nevertheless movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view it is revolutionary movie not because it is about one mans defiance but because it put frontandcenter black issues that had never been dealt before until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated specifically black roles that were important only in relation whites the fact that sweet sweetback was movie black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community van peebles tells an interesting story that goes long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it when the movie first opened he saw it in theater next an older woman near the end of the when sweetback is wounded the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying herself oh lord let him die do not let them kill him let him die on his own it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any africanamerican in movie who rebelled against white authority that she could not even conceive of the possibility that the might end his successful escape and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills the message watch out baad asssss nigger is coming back collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture van peebles always intended it be he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time he shot in rough documentarylike fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twentyfive years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this but there is more the than its racial aspect the legacy of sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the africanamerican perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought fund and produce that is important him,1.0
there seem be two reactions dark city you either love it or you are unimpressed count me as love it as good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better where the former two have specific comicbook following the latter is an original work the potential for broader appeal it has similar look the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent not clever or complex the story is still fascinating like selection from the twilight zone man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub man syringe surprised the attacker runs off the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds womans body in the room mysterious caller warns him leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why he is leaving or what he is fleeing ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in nightmare an odd blast of willpower allows the man dream himself free from his pursuers long enough check his d the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch now if only he could remember the rest of his life dark city is good on many levels first the look of the movie is excellent give credit production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating coherent look from diverse elements there are visual elements from the american ss mixed dickensera urban industrial elements it is all pulled together in sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hoppers painting nighthawks proyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality the films world for not only does the audience see the city model but so do the ghouls the look is like cross between tim burtons batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay second the editing of the is good the pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments also the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie tense caffeinated look third the special effects are well used they look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job one example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically simple ripple effect is used more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous restraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive finally like gattaca dark city spends just little effort striving for mythical significance unlike gattaca the story is just openended and nonliteral enough be successful john murdochs recovery from amnesia is tied the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn his struggle amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world when we finally see the big picture of the movies world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of giant turtle few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness,1.0

field of dreams almost defies description although it is about baseball it is not baseball movie although the is extremely spiritual it is not about religion and although field of dreams is melodramatic it is not tearjerker really understand what field of dreams is all about you have see it in the kevin costner plays ray kinsella baseball fan berkeley graduate and iowa farmer one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields ray hears voice it tells him if you build it he will come then ray has vision and somehow concludes that if he builds baseball field in the middle of his corn shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead play ball once again and even though it depletes his familys savings and his neighbors think he is crazy ray clears away the corn and builds baseball field complete bleachers and flood lights if you build it he will come and lo and behold shoeless joe does comebringing him several of his dead teammates and then ray hears the voice again it tells him ease his pain ray thinks this means that he must travel boston meet terence mann an influential and radical novelist from the who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society great aplomb james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces ray and embarks him on magical and spiritual journey the cast in field of dreams is excellent especially kevin costner in the lead role costner gives quiet subtle and moving performance as man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale amy madigan gives fine supporting performance as rays feisty and loving wife who against her better judgement supports her husbands crazy ideas in her most impressive scene madigan vehemently argues against book burning at p a meeting displaying the sincere passion of s berkeley radical ray liotta is appropriately eerie and aweinspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the chicago black sox scandal and finally burt lancaster is memorable in small but important role as small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited only one inning field of dreams is touching fairy tale full of life wonder mystery spirit and humor it for the most part succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief ray kinsellas spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves be moving and miraculous but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama it unfortunately does at times go overboard and the end it gets downright sappy in general however field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasyone can recommend everyone but unromantic cynics,1.0
making sequel widely beloved is weighty proposition indeed especially when the first is considered many be masterpiece when it comes living up expectations filmmaker is almost doomed some degree of failure for sequel live up or even surpass the originals greatness is very rare indeed and whereas babe pig in the city misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe it is worthy companion piece more than that it is spectacular work of art that deserves stand alone in its own right babe pig in the city warrants the classification of being recognized such classics like the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced babe pig in the city picks up precisely where babe left off having won the sheep herding competition farmer hoggett james cromwell and his pig are elevated fame status series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads mrs hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city in doing so the transports us into wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original babe pig in the city flourishes where so many sequels fail most sequels simply rehash the events of the first not babe pig in the city this is completely original tale that offers up story drastically different than the first also not being content utilize most of the old characters this gives us many new ones enjoy in essence it does not attempt copy itself instead it strives achieve an originality of its own and it succeeds that is not say the familiar is absent babe pig in the city retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first along babe himself ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride as does mrs hoggett one of this decades best and most underappreciated comic characterizations hilariously performed magda szubanski the three singing mice also make the journey chiming in their cute highpitched vocals the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced title cards read the aforementioned mice from there we are guided once again roscoe lee brownes soothingly deep narrative composer nigel westlake also returns his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting while staying at the flealands hotel babe encounters veritable arkfull of new animals monkeys kittens and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new urbanites that babe befriends as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens encounter each character is distinctly unique some of are imbued personal humanlike struggles that are endearing and touching and while this world focuses largely on these animals we are introduced two new human characters as well mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel an animalloving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors steins landlady is wonderfully odd caricature we also meet fugly floom an old softspoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel utilizing them as part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior seeing the it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise see who it was so as not ruin this wellkept secret will not reveal the actors identity here it was treat indeed see one of cinemas legends grace the screen again in what was superbly gentle and heartwarming performance the greatest triumph of babe pig in the city is the art direction simply putit bleeds creativity taking the look of the original whole new level restricted primarily farm the first time around this second installment creates an entire city dazzling us unique fablelike architecture but the stroke of pure genius production designer roger ford is his use of our worlds architectural landmarks designing skyline that includes the statue of liberty the sydney opera house the brooklyn bridge the sign and the eiffel tower ford has created singular city that encompasses all of our cities as seen in the photo and preproduction drawing your right added that many of this citys streets are the twin siblings of venices gondolatrekked rivers the metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is wondrous sight behold it is world that you want walk around in norma moriceaus costume designs belong in this world vibrant in color and style equal that of the fords landscape most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish the most exotically grand design going that of fugly flooms clown outfit andrew lesnies photography captures these elements various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the films multiple emotional tones much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up the release of babe pig in the city reports stated that its original cut was branded pg rating these reports were discovered be false as it was assigned pg rating but even so be anything harsher than the original g rating had many parents and fans up in arms deleting minimal number of shots babe pig in the city was eventually given the coveted rating although appeased many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark fearing that the may have come be possessed tim burton himself well coin phrase the reports of babe pig in the city death at the hands of dark scary felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated granted it has its moments of pseudomorbidity but allinall babe pig in the city is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be whatever dark moments it may have can be attributed director george miller the mad max trilogy the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil having served as producer and cowriter on the first miller moves into the directors chair for this one putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise the story of babe pig in the city is an enchanting yarn but one that does not achieve the emotional or character depth of the original missing here is the attempt broach such heady themes as personal identity an individuals worth challenging conformity and ones purpose in life babe dealt this weighty subject matter creating timeless fable babe pig in the city should not have rehashed these themes but do wish it would have attempted explore new ones this is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife class differences sacrificial courage and so on but this films goals are not as lofty as the firsts instead choosing take more straightforward approach allowing its themes take back seat an exciting sometimes intense fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive babe pig in the city also decides against developing relationship the level of was present in the first specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe hoggetts love for babe grew ever so gently is what gave that its charming and endearing quality best exemplified in hoggetts dance for babe this moving relationship was truly unique it is something that wish would have been present again and could have through fugly floom but was not please understand these are not negative criticisms per se but simply statements of what see as the differences between babe pig in the city being very good and the original being great one but having said that these observations are minor critiques at best as an overall piece babe pig in the city is thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning end sure it is not great but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness it is that is magical its charm and humor exciting in its adventurous exploits funny its dry wit and cute voices and breathtaking in its presentation babe pig in the city may not be moviemaking at its absolute best but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema as result if you choose let this pass you you will be missing of the years best cinematic treats,1.0
let me first say that the conditions that was forced watch the matrix under were less than ideal so have tried be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal watched the matrix in theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times under no circumstances should it have ever been allowed show big budget special effects laden like the matrix this theater owned the parent company of one of hollywoods biggest studios has not even graduated into stereo sound yet the mono sound that the audience was subjected sounded as if it was coming out of speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age in other words the sound sucked as someone used digital sound in movie theater bad sound does not do anything add am not even going go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this together there have had my rant now on the regularly scheduled review sadly will not include commentary on the films sound am assuming was spectacular but am just guessing my guess on the sound seems like fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix it is nothing short of stunning visually sadly the rest of the while pretty good does not quite measure up the obvious effort that was expended on making this look so darn good the matrix has at it is core good concept although it strays into the confusing side more often than would have liked keanu reeves plays computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just hoax it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated some sort of disaster now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in sort of incubator plugged into computer network the computers are generating virtual reality world is representation of the earth before it was destroyed the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose that is except small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort expose this lie reeves character neo is recruited this band of rebels led morpheus laurence fishburne newcomer carrieanne moss and one of hollywoods most underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne in the band of freedomfighters the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular this can be attributed as much the amazing special effects as many of the actors extensive preproduction training in martial arts this lends itself some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely see in when you add this some of the wild effects in the computer generated world it all adds up an eyeful as already said the visuals far outpace the rest of the acting in the matrix is not bad but it certainly is not real good either keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances although his credit it is one of his better performances laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed forget that he was in scifi action more than few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama joe pantoliano was little under used in this but he made the most what he had carrieanne moss turned out surprisingly good performance for this her first feature role it is nice see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks you have give all of the main actors healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue was terrible at times in more than few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird it almost seems as though the writers were having difficult time trying figure out how explain the concept for the movie so they decided make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had make in the departments of logic and believability my other major complaint the matrix was the very unsatisfying ending the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many bad before the ending itself was just plain strange the main reasons recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation make this real treat watch while the rest of the acting dialogue and degree plot detract from the high production values they do not detract enough prevent me from recommending the matrix as fun way spend an evening,1.0

who would have thought jim carrey does drama when first saw the advertisement for the truman show thought what hilarious idea for movie however it was an even better premise for drama the truman show takes us into world that revolves around one man that man is truman burbank jim carrey truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly cristof wants keep it that way christof is the god of this madeup world he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles there were few attempts tell truman about his world but they failed and life went on as normal the opening parts of the introduce trumans world we see what he is doing at his current age then we get flashback at his past it may seem tad boring but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love the right from the start the can be described in one word weird it seems like such simple idea yet it is something that majority of us would never think of but andrew niccol did it seems like warped idea but it is andrews idea and he did wonders it jim carrey actually lived up the hype the hype whether good or bad always focused on carreys ability do drama no one doubted how extraordinary this could be the only thing they doubted was carrey and he showed them all up jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars do not think he was the best actor but he deserved the nomination he plays truman burbank the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world he has lived normal life for almost thirty years but then strange things start happening he ventures into the wrong elevator light crashes in front of him his father comes back and is then pulled away we are constantly teased all of this and we know it is show but truman does not and it is just constant progression that never gets sluggish carrey is able shed his comedy play major role in major drama laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife she plays her role as advertiser and budding star point peter weir does not make the cast perfect and their flaws eventually lead trumans escape the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down despite carreys greatness the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in ed harris who plays the god of trumans world he displays the pressure he is under the world he has created he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is god and that truman has him thank for his sham of life the action moves at good pace and rarely gets sluggish but the main point of the is how it looks like television show it really makes you think maybe your brother is an actor maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations stay on the show some of the best parts of the are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon noah emmerich delivers his dramatic line all of these ideas are just perfect for the and extremely innovative was not only enjoying the was overwhelmed genius of it overall the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films come out of jim carrey shows that he is not just man of million faces but legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off perfection the truman show is must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed this creative,1.0
capsule this is harrowing look at rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in japanese prison camp end all wars is moving about the struggle of prisoners retain their humanity and their dignity the somewhat religious interpretation may not be everyones taste more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way this may be holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty ones master was the only law during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war this led them do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal minimum resources were be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping maximal positive output while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly death on the thailand burma railroad that railroad was needed if japan was attack india as it planned do the best thing for the effort was not waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany filmmakers have been reticent tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps certainly there was david leans the bridge on the river kwai there were some lowbudget british exploitation films and that was about it then there were tv series town like alice and tenko lest the experience be forgotten we have new end all wars directed david cunningham and written brian godawa it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on become for years the dean of the chapel at princeton university the while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them the story opens six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only be immediately placed in front of firing squad it turns out be grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play amuse themselves beating and torture are commonplace events men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals enjoy the last of their health it will not last long parasites and disease almost inevitable however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want avoid going the hospital called the prisoners the death house so goes war within war the prisoners trying maintain their humanity and the japanese trying make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in raillaying machine this is more than just battle of who will win the war but battle of ideologies the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity groups norms is all that gives life meaning conformity is purpose before the is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story if the british one american the way and the japanese learned respect each other it would be another kind of story it is neither it is stirring and believable account of camp life the color has been distorted in the give washed out yellow this serves double purpose for cunningham it gives an effect of technicolor that has been left in heat it also creates distancing effect the only touch that seems little out of place is the use of gaelic music this is powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience rate it on the scale and on the scale,1.0

a frequent error is the categorization of terrorist as soldier or common criminal soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned one nationstate against another common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain terrorist employs random violence as means political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states you would think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the s responds retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack however unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility the version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight the new world unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza while investigating series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying uncover information generally the fbi is charged problems inside the s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm even spies from other countries are off limits the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is bit excessive who is going believe that few bombs are going cause new yorkers jump at the backfire of bus or curtail their shopping twothirds but the basic premise is still valid liked the fact that this rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of few arabs would escalate into series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population and that in an effort find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated the government itself in fact about halfway through the when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be side effect of terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is scary thought and goal would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the maintains conflict between hubbard who wants use the fbi pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but it is credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they do not underestimate the intelligence of the audience do not know if it is his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of female character have seen recently and the chemistry she shares washington is palpable it is somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at certain point but it allows us watch bening play little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated toughguy role always standing straight and permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is major drive behind the films development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere his integration into the american society difficult say the least shalhoub does it naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful big night whereas denzel washington seems be edward zwicks favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems be his favorite composer therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until realized that this contained lot of arabianthemed music and horners record has shown more of propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most revell does good job at providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes and allowing the score enhance the movie as whole it is nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we have been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in couple of the excesses it takes for example it is pretty clear throughout that the is meant be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately there is scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use cobra attack helicopter shoot rockets into building no farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the also gets little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races get along noble gesture the just puts the message across bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they do not detract too much from an otherwise good that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class,1.0
very few people would be unaware of beavis butthead both created and narrated mike judge they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know human kind you may have seen them on their television program as they snigger and make lude remarks about women anything related sex and the music clips that they watch in beavis butthead do america the pair finally make their big screen debut the delight of some and the deplore of others beavis butthead yes those are their real names are two very ugly teenagers extremely warped minds driven raging hormones they live their lives in front of the television the worst possible event occurs the pair when their television is stolen this happens as they sleep and when they awake it takes them few minutes just decipher that the television has gone beavis even tries use the remote though there is no television there the two spot van outside and two sinister looking men carrying television even at this point they have no idea what has happened they look around seeing all the evidence but are completely oblivious the fact that these men have just stolen their television before the movie knew that they were stupid but did not realise just how stupid this is typical of their behaviour throughout the eventually they realise that their television has been stolen so they leave their sofa go search for television luck would have it that they stumble into hotel room looking for television where man is awaiting two guys whose task it is kill his wife this man thinking that beavis butthead are the assigned killers tells them that they can have if they do his wife beavis butthead being the ignorant fools that they are think that he is offering them dollars have sex his good looking wife they are taken the airport where they fly las vegas do her them this is the best day of their lives not only are they going lose their virginity one of their lifelong aims but most importantly they will have enough money buy big screen tv inevitably they become caught up in huge crime and unbeknown them are tracked across the country the fbi oddly enough it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught as result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds they end up travelling right across america visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations their one time out in the big world away from their television they are completely oblivious it at old faithful they are far more fascinated the infrared operated urinals than the geyser itself beavis butthead essentially have the journey of their lives they even get meet the president but all they care about is getting their television back and losing their virginity this is one of the many reasons that the is so funny it is unbelievable just how stupid they are and how they can be so oblivious everything around them the humour is certainly crude but then beavis butthead are just that crude lude and rude in the end you cannot help but feel sorry for them pair of antisocial couch potatoes whose life is television in this respect and also regard authority such as the fbi mike judge is quite critical of amercian society if you are easily offended or find this pair particularly annoying steer clear otherwise it should keep you laughing the whole way through one note of warning do not take friends who like imitate beavis butthead you will never hear the end of it,1.0
