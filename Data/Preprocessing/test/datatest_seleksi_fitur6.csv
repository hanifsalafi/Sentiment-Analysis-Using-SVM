Review,Class
you always have be careful the first official studio release out of the gate each year they are obviously films for the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season combine that howie longs first starring action role and you have got doozy of movie that while not as bad as it could have been is not very good howie stars as an ace smokejumper firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played scott glenn attempt rescue small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire william forsythe plays the bad guy mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away help fund his jailbreak he and five convict cohorts manages get selected for firefighting duty when woodland blaze just happens ignite nearby his escape plan bets lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be movie luck is him soon the nowescaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters why canadian who knows eh along the way they pick up pretty birdwatcher suzy amis be their hostage enter howie long he is called in help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in help when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage longs acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not much although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden he is likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better the script does not help him out any however all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny the dialogue is strictly bmovie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences be believable longs costars are mixed bag at least they are all comfortable in their respective roles forsythe has the scenerychewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable watch even when he does not seem be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here suzy amis plays peril pretty well but is not given much more do some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland you would think that the director dean semler former cinematographer would at least produce interesting visuals that is not the case there is lack of originality nearly all the sequences we have seen this stuff before it is not the most auspicious start but it could have been worse just think back debut biodome however after month of oscarcaliber pictures movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were in fact there is good chance that some of them are still playing near you,0.0
synopsis easilyangered chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce diedre easily cons davids notsobright new wife molly into believing she is child psychologist so that she can influence molly and davids quicktempered son michael diedre at the same time murders bunch of people comments the ex is very bad movie have not seen turkey of this magnitude in quite while kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately decided split the difference and give it two stars as summarized briefly in the synopsis this is yet another spurnedpsycholovergetsherrevenge type movie am not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction use this tired storyline but it seems like the ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it does not take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples come mind those involved in the movie realize they are in turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script the exs storyline as said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie diedre davids first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having worry about police investigations and the like it is not as though she is bright enough not leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability control his anger though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made molly is easily swayed diedre into believing she is child psychologist and allows the demented woman spend time her son time and time again things do not add up in this movie if viewer cannot accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex if on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then he will probably like it much better do not mean necessarily suggest however that the ex is memorable exercise in camp even when viewed from an it issobadit isgood angle this movie is not all that successful the ex does have its moments though almost all of involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has punchline that is unbelievably inane when she murders tenant of an apartment she wishes use spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady crowbar and states am so sorry your lease is terminated or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene diedres therapist wishes have her recommitted so she decides visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that it is not hers therapists typically are catatonically braindead in these movies having successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said me at the end of each session dr jones oh that is right am sorry but your time is up this is what passes for humor in the the audience does not necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience cannot believe they are watching this crap although watching it they are nick mancuso as chainsmoking nervouswreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butlers character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief in between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movies best scenes david tries explain his lawyer what creep his exwife is in exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is cuckoobird trust me it is funny in context and so the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion will not reveal the ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this review but will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in molly and david own cabin that becomes engulfed flames in approximately three seconds molly at one point in the notsobrilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her familys spy upon them that she is crazy you would be pretty crazy too if you would rented this turkey would avoid it unless it is on tv and you come across it if you do you may want watch it groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot and feel good that you did not spend money renting it,0.0
the blues brothers was wonderful hilarious comedy packed good music it cried out for sequel but john belushis untimely death seemed eliminate the idea however eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged unfortunately it is sequel not worthy of the original the starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended elwood blues dan aykroyd is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died as in the first he first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman and then sets about getting the band back together john belushis absence leaves terrible hole in the and although three new characters are created fill the void it is still very noticeable first there is cabel joe morton the illegitimate son of elwoods stepfather played cab calloway in the first movie cabel is reluctant join his destiny and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff chasing the blues brothers band next there is mighty mack john goodman bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band finally there is buster evan bonifant ten year old orphan who tags along elwood and eventually joins the band the plotting of the is hardly original it seems be almost clone of the original elwood has go reluctantly retrieve each member of the band they then travel while being pursued the police and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale the first had neonazis as the random element this time around the russian mafia and militia group fill their role in fact the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical the original remember the classic performance at country bobs where they like both types of music country and western from the first movie well this movie has performance at country fair where the band is expected play bluegrass music there is the massive police car pileup although this time the gag falls completely flat there is even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus james brown there are plenty of recurring characters too in addition mother stigmata and reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs murphy frank oz prison guard in the first makes an appearance here as the prison warden as the stars the new blues brothers do not live up their legacy aykroyd is more loquacious yet much flatter as elwood john goodman barely has character as mighty mack joe morton has the deepest character but not terribly interesting one as cab and what is the deal the orphan it plays like desperate gimmick that does not mesh at all the rest of the at least bonifant is not as precocious as he could have been in the role but the true star and the only saving grace of the is the music and the is packed it even during and after the ending credits although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the originals rawhidestand your man medley the music is very much enjoyable top it off the is packed the gills cameo musician appearances b king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley and steve winwood are just sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there unfortunately the music pauses here and there allow in the familiar plot if simply copying the original blues brothers was not bad enough writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down removing any memorable characters and replacing them flashy but unbelievable magical gimmicks it is shame buy the soundtrack and avoid the better yet rewatch the original you will have much better time,0.0
michael crichton has had long career of writing novels many of are science fiction the most profitable adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of michael crichton science fiction novel so in the logic of the industry good way make profitable would be make bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel congo failed and am afraid that sphere is probably not going fare whole lot better it little better than just okay novel and it makes that is not even that good the is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long minutes has terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting several years ago dr norman goodman played dustin hoffman was asked write up set of procedures for the government follow if an alien entity was actually encountered the plan he wrote was only semiserious but did explicitly define team of experts who should investigate the alien now that team has been assembled mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote study spacecraft almost half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early suddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing real alien spacecraft included in the team investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber together they travel the deep pacific spaceship understand its secrets one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship what is disappointing about this is that it does not have really effective performances director barry levinson is at his best good actors rather than good special effects the problem here is he is making bigbudget science fiction it has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on radar screen the technique is suggest rather than show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the as robert wise did the haunting that could be reasonable approach in lowbudget but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage muster it requires the actors give really compelling performances and simply put they do not hoffmans acting seems muted jackson seems laid back we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance and why we have queen latifah as minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at fraction of the price look how much more powerful like alien was only moderate actors most science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects levinson tries secondtier effects and firsttier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer perhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium the result gets on the scale and on the scale,0.0
american pie is filled laughs but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for locker room than movie theater am no prude and admit laughing along everyone else at the preview screening this sequel the hit comedy but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself what separates american pie from its predecessor is heart of the original noted it was warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up at least they are year older but do not seem any wiser fresh from their first year of college the quartet along the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent summer house the lake in order attract girls in an attempt score as usual nothing goes right until the last reel but what we are left is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women and american pie is rather degrading women for the most part they are not shown as individuals they are nothing more than potential recipients of overactive raging hormones it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the trying have phone sex she is overseas on an exchange student program despite having been college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including painful episode involving an instant gluelike substance also uncomfortable watch is sequence involving three of the lads two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes generate laughs the first despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm it the sequel is more cynical it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it them the many mentions of finchs encounter stiflers mom becomes tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levys return as jims wellmeaning tryingtobehip dad the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original in the sequel she imbues her character vulnerability wisdom and maturity american pie is presold commodity that will earn several million at the box office it is shame though that in its rush rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher american pie is funny but it is still comedown as well as letdown,0.0
well what are you going expect it is movie about big snake that eats people that is what should have been thinking when viewed this because maybe then would have enjoyed myself more instead ended up wishing giant snake would come along and eat me too anaconda is about documentary crew sailing down south american river led anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting locate lost tribe of natives along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest capture the elusive anaconda simply say that this is the worlds largest snake would not be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide if this is not good reason avoid picking up hitchhikers do not know what is at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems be more or less over now expected that fact play key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being setup for nothing cale chokes on deadly wasp do not ask me how that happens do not know and is put out of action relegated being the person whom the rest of the crew must get back civilization for medical help this minimally helps add sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict sarones plan capture the snake however this is negated the fact that cale seems get better himself about halfway through the and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle most bad characters are either annoying or stupid in this movie they are both since this description applies all the characters except sarone it is hard find someone root for you are supposed back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he is smarter than everyone else or maybe he is just not as dumb as everyone else at times almost found myself rooting for the snake there are no standout performances here everyone seems be reciting lines written for stock characters even voight appears be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed be the real star anyway in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did decent job of making it look real however the realism is thrown off some pretty unrealistic occurrences sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast it catches guy jumping off of waterfall for crying out loud then there is another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snakes skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victims pained expression from within the snakes belly absolutely ridiculous testimony the films bad direction is the inclusion of scene early on the in the where we get see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is in scene totally unrelated anything else we are witness the big snake winning showdown panther the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panthers eyeballs pops out eeeewwwww above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before quarter of the movie had even passed in films like these sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained if the characters are reacting something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along them show us the monster early on is let us in on something the characters do not know about and therefore allow us get used the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown in case like that the showdown just ends up being letdown when saw the snake for the first time decided give the the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake saw was not the real danger this one was just decoy and there was actually bigger snake waiting make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe no such luck okay maybe anaconda is actually decoy and there is really better movie waiting make its debut,0.0
this is extraordinarily horrendous and am not going waste any more words on it,0.0
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns coworker and says thought this movie would be my first big break instead it is turned into disaster truer words have never been spoken anaconda is monster movie lousy monster it is suspense that is utterly predictable it is mess the does manage drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like jackinthebox as you turn the crank you are totally aware that the damn clown is going pop up but somehow it is still mildly startling when it happens the main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in jackinthebox is that the clown is more realistic anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects appear onscreen in years animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots you have endured at disney world but it is the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame in one shot character tries flee from the monster diving from tree near waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air the scene if done well would have been jaw dropper here the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than saturday morning cartoon what is really amazing is that the filmmakers were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie but enough about the phony snakes now it is time talk about the lousy story heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads documentary crew down brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest stoltz tells his crew pray that you did not forget your bug spray apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the wearing skimpy tops and short shorts no ill effect along the way the group rescues whackedout lapsed priest jon voight who claims know how find the shirishama within minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down tributary into the land of creepiness from that point on the is hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm one of the oddest structural points of the is the handling of eric stoltz early in the story his character gets knocked into coma river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts cameo appearance also why did stoltz who generally selects his roles great care agree appear in this crap ah the mysteries of the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting happen jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as pompous englishman hired narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage rise above their cardboard characters lopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible ice cube has special charisma an ability look like macho adult and frightened boy simultaneously there is also special twinkle in his eyes as if he is gently mocking his own toughguy posturing but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight obsessed capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest at one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine it strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins explode that moment is so highcamp that it almost made the tolerable almost fans of the horror genre may be tempted check out anaconda do not there are lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel wait for them rent jaws in the meantime and do not throw away your money and time on drivel like this,0.0

well lets see am not quite sure how review this based on its laughter factor well yeah can it is not funny ok so laughed one time warranted the star but other than that sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over at running time of minutes seemed like forever in fact this could be the unfunniest movie have seen in long time if not the unfunniest let me be the first say ready rumble is huge disappointment long time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle that is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw well here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered many people who are out get them while davids father wants him become police officer and scott is loser who has the help of david clean out johnny on the spots what plot eh ready rumble is one of those films that tries be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer was not funny the actors are dull the script awful and the plot there is not much of really annoying am not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such lame script and directed in such childish manner that wonder if is ever gonna make good films these days this review is not going be very long because of the fact that there is not much going for the if anything at all only one big laugh is in the is not all that hilarious sat in my chair wondering this minute comedy was going be over and sadly it went on forever am not sure if anything could have saved this from being such total waste but believe me you it is reviewed brandon herring for more reviews please visit movie review central at http www geocities commoviefanmoviereviewcentral html,0.0
years ago national lampoon introduced us new family the griswolds in the griswolds embarked on crosscountry journey the destination of wally world worldrenowned theme park in california we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured two years later we watched again as they went europe and four years after that we shared christmas them now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die they have been cremated vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but illfated father of two the premise is basically the same clark has wonderful idea take his family on bonding vacation this time las vegas his wife ellen beverly dangelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played different actors this time around ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick of course vacation movie would not be complete without good ole eddie reprised randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times there is not too much of plot here when it comes right down it it is really just skit movie there are couple of ways define skit movie is not real term as far as know the first would be movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like two hour skit the second would be movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first good example of the latter would be last years black sheep the problem this format is that it becomes old fast and it does not really fit into movie mold in these cases plot is generally very thin is used either as shameless filler between scenes or simply add convenience the gags e have good vegas joke make vegas movie such is the case this movies miniplots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money ellen is on the verge of an affair wayne newton rusty has fake id and is using it his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae dlyn as an exotic dancer the simple fact is this movie is not funny at first did find myself chuckling heartily at couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well he made the character and he is the character dangelo be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie does not show any signs of redemption as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes mind the vacation series seems out prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing them they are so generic you will expect the credits read girl as audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series more than just laugh factor yes it is true that vegas vacation is not even close being close being as funny as the others were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are couple of other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title could not find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon did not want be associated such lame that is saying lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc if they expected this be another hit you would assume they would be proud tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they did not there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact the first three films in the vacation series were written john hughes talented writer who is behind several popular films of the including mr mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris buellers day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what r sum looking at the names you would think this guy wrote everything that now stands as movie icon for the well that is not all this guy also brought us hits including the home alone series the remake of dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however did not have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four madefortv movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as madefortv sequel if this sounds like wild idea it is not revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a sunday morning movie but as silver screen major motion picture it is quite out of place stephen kesslers jejune direction does not help things either he only makes the even more tvmovieish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered drop in directing power we started the series off harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters not too bad then we had national lampoons european vacation being directed amy heckerling who would go on direct the hits look who is talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high lastly we had national lampoons christmas vacation directed jeremiah chechik who went on direct the charming benny joon kessler so far has one title under his belt the short birch street gym received an oscar nomination in granted that this was his first attempt at feature length we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal if you loved the vacation movies and know some of us did there still is not anything here worth seeing if you loved them do not ruin your good impressions of the series indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte if

plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony naturally this got me worried would jakes talent be inherited from ridley or tony if it was from ridley than the movie would be thoughtful suspensor action thrown in if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture little charm carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller clean cut gentleman as the tagline clearly wants make known they rob the rich and nothing else the basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along romantic interludes lady rebecca tyler hot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants see them both dead plunkett macleane is an annoying little that serves little purpose although undoubtedly slick and fast paced there is very little merit contained in the carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script the five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie there is very little development in the story also major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened the story is bit of mess frankly the performances are not bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is huge disappointment as the love interest her irritable stilted performance sticks out like sore thumb and was quite unsure on what accent she was trying put on she looks nice though more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts nothing more than two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well ken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but flat character did not particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived although disappointment in writing and minor success in acting the certainly look lavish good costumes and wonderful sets but production design alone cannot save movie especially movie as bad as this mess jake scott would be more suited directing music video rather than this failed update of period drama the only update seems be the fact that everyone must talk dirty ck this and stand and cking deliver splattered all over the place the mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty plunkett macleane is massive disappointment although somewhat enjoyable during parts it is so light it could float off the screen if it was not just images on reel there is no thought no development no plot just series of manic edits and quirky camera angles make this appeal genxers although it is great idea update period drama the mtv generation it is execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless it is hard recommend plunkett macleane as movie but easy recommend it as overlong music video give it miss,0.0
capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibsons short story is nowhere in sight gibsons script only adds insult injury johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie say awesomely because it is one thing fail but another thing entirely fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head he is given one last job whenever you are in movie and you hear those words run involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was ditching all of his childhood memories but it is only followed up on in token fashion for his trouble johnny gets chased the yakuza who seem be the new bad guys in all the hightech thrillers what is funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course there is no room in this movie for any of that the yakuza are simply used point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound honor sugar hill and american me come mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped but that is another essay anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark why newark maybe because it was cheaper fake future newark than future new york that is why there he meets an assortment of odd characters icet dolph lundgren and henry rollins play whole gallery of weirdos the script deals them all the depth of pieces of furniture it turns out what else that the data in johnnys head could save lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it does not kill him handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come mind everything looks rundown and scummy everyone dresses like they are punk rockers and videophones are commonplace snore the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete vr goggles and feedback gloves but kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would think it would look and behave like hacker of johnnys caliber would be blasting away one commandline function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling holograms but of course that is not cinematic whatever what went wrong this movie gibson wrote his own screenplay guess is part of the problem what works as short story does not work in movie his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot does not advance it convulses from the script on out it was probably all downhill renting the movie make fun of it is sort of pointless there is no fun in kicking wounded dog is there,0.0
i did not hate the big hit even though it is stupefyingly terrible for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached the screen and never once got bored found the interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such confused disaster of that it is entertaining watch it in the same way that it is entertaining witness thirty car pileup on freeway spaghetti bowl as narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries it reminded me lot of grosse pointe blank is similar that fails in lot of the same ways it is fine mix genres if the makers know what they are doing unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong do not seem know how handle the material and the result is an action that wants be comedy the biggest problem the amalgamation in this case is that the is absurd and the comedy is out of place but it sure is fascinating failure marky er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley hitman he is good hitman apparently although his tactics seem bit rambunctious he does not snipe or make clean killshe just kicks the door down and shoots everything he works few other hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr they are nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation sex they all work for man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in they decide kidnap young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has rich father when they do this it turns out she is paris goddaughter it is very bad have paris against you the story is standard action stuff it is nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it is john wootype of action mixed in some really hip comedy it is true that lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as faceoff and the replacement killers are both far superior there are stunts that are fun watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in kill some guy who has nothing do the story they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent avoid bullets and knives like said it is not boring most disasters are not what makes it so bad is its genreshifting madness it seems start out as quirkybutrealistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains then as soon as they go their first hit it turns into music video bodies and bullets flying everywhere then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy keiko turns out be spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced read letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone scenes that should be more serious or not be in the at all one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco come up his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him find the perpetrator the scene is played for laughs but it is not funny and since it does not quite work as comedy it tries fall back on the action also fails this is where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot handgun cars land on tree branches and are supported them characters betray each other without second thought grenades are thrown in tight places people jump out of tall buildings and survive people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds most frustrating of all though is the films definition of hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals they are more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and handheld machineguns the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously does not make for deep or interesting people watch the acting is kind of fun thoughwahlberg is good actor and his innocuous presence in this is charming in silly sort of way phillips certainly has fun his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvins fianc is convincingly airheaded the big hit is an action that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying be funny the funniest parts are supplied the actors and not the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and oneliners it is true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional despite all this though must reiterate the entertainment value here you can cherish the awfulness of like this if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself,0.0
when the features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than b grade action movie however since this also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided give the some benefit of the doubt however the very first scenes show clear grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played lynch however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap so he begins his own private war against gio trying penetrate his organisation pretending be corrupt in the process he meets gios mistress gina zamora played rosie vela and starts relationship her too although it does not stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable grade action routine nobody in this actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the only not so forgettable element in this is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too however this is not reason enough for viewers spend hour and half watching that they would in most likelihood forget the next day,0.0

you do not look at ren magritte painting and search for deeper meaning you likewise do not look at one for minutes straight surrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and half is exhausting that was my experience woke up early the day died surrealistic hyperactive comedy no dialogue it is not silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word though the is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about minutes and as it progressed watching became chore the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written the pseudolegendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan from outer space and night of the ghouls the joke of course is that his films are so bad they are good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits woke up early the day died unfortunatly is so bad that it is really bad it stars billy zane titanic as dangerous lunatic who overpowers nurse escapes from mental hospital and proceeds wonder around stealing car clothes and load of money our thief reaches cemetery where he witnesses bizarre ritual he falls asleep and finds himself literally in hole his money gone for whatever reason he is bent on getting his hardunearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why did not he just go steal some more he comes upon list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences seek out each of them and kill them if they do not have what he is looking for do not think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made glorious minute short the subject and the style seem have been made for it unfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out more than four times that length and the simply overstays its already dubious welcome it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up the point where halfway through was already weary it might seem odd that as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is woke up early the day died is comedy guess though it could have fooled me unlike most ed wood films this one tries be funny and fails instead of the other way around there is nothing inherently wrong that in fact think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies take stab at real one whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we will never know but in either case this is failure jonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos ricci for example plays prostitute her role consists of dancing around zane in his motel room and then being thrown out thomas is an astonished onlooker as woman gets thrown off cliff was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work zane meanwhile occupies himself making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon run around wildly and beat people up lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature the carnival sideshow climax manages demonstrate everything that is wrong this nobudget production it is desperately unfunny but thinks it is the funniest thing since plan it is so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction hope another is made from an ed wood screenplay for woke up early the day died is not fitting sendoff eugene novikov,0.0
well as check my score card for what have done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas and dumb ideas do not know what was thinking when decided watch this movie but in my defense can only say that it was someone else who urged me see this him the that am talking about is a night at the roxbury one of those offerings based on saturday night live skit wayne and garth these two are not rather we meet doug and steve butabi the actors names are not worth mentioning two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem be finding way get into the hottest night club in the city the roxbury driving in their dads bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice they try bribe the bouncer get into the club have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change their second greatest ambition seems be oozing out as many silly pickup lines as is humanly possible in order start conversation girl let me see that label just as thought made in heaven says one of the brothers and like the losers that they are they fail do either for much of the however as fate would have it an accidental meeting whateverhappenedto richard grieco gives them the allimportant ticket get in their sad lives take on whole new direction they make an important contact the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene and they are mistaken as rich swingers two voluptuous young women but their newfound popularity does not impress their father who has other plans for them the unfortunate thing about this is that this is onejoke movie and the brothers are the joke actually there is about mintues worth of tolerable stuff alas too long for tv and way too short for featurelength thus there just is not enough material sustain the minute movie there is no plot be found and everything that these two do seem culminate in an opportunity execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison the funky beat of haddaways europop song what is love was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash take up more time there is subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants marry doug this creates not only friction between the brothers but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well she is educated and forebearing witch meanwhile doug is complete loser how did these two ever get together suppose that if can ever figure out the answer that question will have figured out why decided go and see this movie if you are looking for entertainment you will not find it at the roxbury,0.0
terrence malick made an excellent minute adaptation of james jones world war ii novel unfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching hour long pseudoepic this is shame because the features an outstanding performance nick nolte the best scene is when nick noltes character lt col tall is forced deal the direct refusal capt staros elias koteas execute an order noltes reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made truly great instead malick saddled the plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and voiceover narration all designed telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry lot of editing the core story could be transformed into truly classic war hopefully the dvd version of this will feature options suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the give this,0.0

the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff harmon written and directed jeff harmon running time minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received telegram from her exfiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about get married high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleanerslave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst dick when april turns down dicks demand for her return bumfuck he decides take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambostyle instead of leveling the place he falls in love lance alex boling and the two of them along april and her lover blatz get married note the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides the camera followed silence that am assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided aprils parents feeling like there is no recourse call in favor president clinton and send nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of homosexual performer their way the bomb is dud thanks the work of the circuitry and they rewire it and send it back washington c destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying get their daughter back and instead decide join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own am not sure if writerdirectorcostar jeff harmon was purposely trying offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages present some of the most offensive material have ever seen in movie the opens preacher running small africanamerican child out of town and then later moves on the hanging of michael jackson impersonator the ku klux klan during jaunty musical number preceded remarks about gays and straights finally being able put their differences behind them and work together hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying point out how idiotic society can be then apologize for being so harsh on elements of his but it is presented so mean spiritedly that cannot help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie am afraid that it is one that just do not get tried keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted society how does one expect be accepted if they are just as guilty of nonacceptance am not prone judging anyone and believe that people should be free explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but do not force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you are not going show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe am missing the satirical point that harmon is trying make but if so think it could have been handled little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells as not ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this should be displaying am lesbian is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but good portion of that could be due the stellar singing voice of ms smith it is mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie odonnell like performance given danica sheridan have no inherent problem her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks strained and lackluster vocal job sheridan the ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked on the end for no reason other than make it feature length once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough end it all why was the needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indieunderground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the is letterboxed at approximately in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like rocky horror for the new millennium this is no means my cup of tea but know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then all means seek it out on the other hand will be cleansing my

one of the indicator of badness in is the hype being remembered more than itself such was the case boxing helena directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch made in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan kim basinger also provided extra publicity quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract but the result was extremely disappointing quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts reestablish the relationship during one of such occasions helena is hit car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order have his way her after she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order prevent her from escaping she is still trying escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms apart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this ms lynch has not got anything in common the works of directors more talented father despite rather bizarre subject the style of this is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed portray jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos the actors are not good either julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic does not suit him bill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing helenas boyfriend sherilyn fenn contributed this mostly her looks but even the her greater effort in acting could not help this the screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made bestseller laura palmers diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the and add the total confusion one of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs regular girlfriend played betsy clarke the twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach endure entire would feel cheated all in all boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career,0.0
let us get this one over as quickly as possible if there was possibility receive refund this review would not be forthcoming but as it is godzilla is without doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written ever released through major studio producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced return school watch last year at merienbad until they can grasp the idea of content and plot no amount of hype no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the equivalent william beaudine billy the kid vs dracula godzilla opens stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs we are then introduced the crew of japanese fish canning ship questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed be supervised eliminate the netting of dolphins well the ship is attacked and sunk an unseen creature later group of frenchmen led philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor in state of shock the only thing the man can utter is the word gojira the japanese name of the famed beast we are then introduced dr nick tatopoulos matthew broderick moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population he is immediately drafted the s military and taken panama where he is shown the huge footprints of creature in short amount of time another fishing boat loaded canned tuna from the s and korea for some reason is found grounded in jamaica well it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york when the beast finally appears he tears up one building stomps couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs up for new york the military dr tatopouloss help have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has cute face face dr tatopoulos who snaps the beasts picture the monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase is on the army causing of the ensuing damage working from hunch as why godzilla has decided come the big apple dr totopoulos buys few home pregnancy kits from local drugstore that has chosen remain open even though new york has been evacuated well the test proves that the monster is hermaphrodite and is pregnant needless say no one believes the good doctor about his discovery so he must join up the renegade french secret service agents and find the monsters nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster is not dead yet sincerely hope that have completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this gave away the relevant plot so that could spare those of you courageous or foolish enough drop down an hours wage on this tripe everything about godzilla reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used trap the beast the script and let us be clear here devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as be sure be the recipient of next years razzie award the dialogue between maria pitillo as audrey timmonds dr tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and mr broderick is so adolescent it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief as happened during the screening witnessed the could be enjoyably campy if it did not take itself so damn seriously but what end as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind no godzilla is just big dummy that got knocked up some french immigrants and decided let the state of new york pay for it the is bleak and ugly looking taking place at night during rain storm the movie has little or no depth everything is ugly and dark new york has never looked so inhospitable since death wish in an attempt give the some color audrey timmonds carries bright red umbrella is unique in that everyone else in the carries the standard gray issue the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica where dr tatopoulos finds himself standing in giant footprint the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up you know from the outset that nick is standing in footprint for scientist this is very poor observation let us look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the this activity is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs and how do those eggs fuse into one beast why would cold blooded creature choose cold climate such as new york nest do not think iguanas have habit of migrating how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice submarine in half yet be unable extricate himself from some thin in comparison steel cable on the brooklyn bridge the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it is suspension cables did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly if so then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures note each egg is feet tall and almost as wide godzilla would have be over feet tall carry them all godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made of stronger steel godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but cannot catch you on foot taxis can out maneuver godzilla godzilla can burrow through the subway system but cannot tear through the park avenue tunnel why was nothing else mutated the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla maybe giant hermit crab in the sequel galapagos iguanas actually live in the french polynesian islands why was dr tatopoulos brought in the military if they were not going listen him anyway how did they evacuate new york island in less than day and how did they convince those new yorkers go new jersey new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting new yorkers hate beta cam could go on and on but that would only serve make the seem more enjoyable than it is do not be fooled this has less gray matter than any episode of americas funniest home videos the performances in the are singularly bland not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror the characters in the midst of the onslaught have time stop and discuss the lack of good coffee failed relationships career choices the only common occurrence that does not take place here is having one of the characters have bowel movement but then that would have made them believable godzilla for the most part is okay the design of the beast is funky if not very memorable one thing that comes mind the major redirection of godzilla in this is remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath now for one cannot quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait good comparison would be make superman and eliminate his ability fly there is so much wrong this that cannot really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce any that can have two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got be envisioned under the influence of prozac the addition of the baby raptors ah meant godzillas are nothing but direct rip off of jurassic park but none of that films suspense or tension suffice say that godzilla is without doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade this is that needed the hype the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the succeeds if you have seen the trailers you have seen the best parts my only suggestion for mr and mr is that they could always go back selling shoes this could be the next rocky horror only it is not funny,0.0
woody allen is one of the most successful artistdirectors in but he is becoming less and less reliable as filmmaker in his early years of filmmaking he mastered the simple comedy from there he went into second phase and took risks experimenting different approaches and styles some of these work better than others zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of creative and intelligent artist deconstructing harry goes the other extreme and is bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back harry block allen has in his life only two drives he wants have sex as many women as possible and when he makes mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants retreat into his writing the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told number of often clumsy stylistic experiments perhaps the most irritating device is express the disjointedness of harrys life editing harrys scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if show missing time something edited out as writer harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises the dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harrys books different actors playing the real and fictional people in harrys life these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes the real characters it is up the viewer keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of real person if that sounds complicated it is then as another device in one of the stories an actor seems have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image harry sees this as metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for short time as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion the story is told out of chronological order if allen were giving the audience story that was worth decoding any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable but allen puts the audience through all of this give us portrait of harry block who is selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort understand deconstructing harry is set at time when harrys old college the one that expelled him when he attended it wants now honor him for lifetime of writing achievement harry is searching among his friends find one who will go him just why someone who is so unwilling commit relationship anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear harry tries his current girl friend fay elizabeth shue only find that she is about marry harrys old friend larry billy crystal block would like his son hilly eric lloyd accompany him but hillys mother previously first harrys psychiatrist and more recently his wife refuses let her son see his father another friend richard bob balaban would go but has health problems harry also considers bringing prostitute cookie hazel goodman it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite but cookie is considerably differentblack and lot brighter than mira sorvinos character in the previous while the comedy sequences are never complete few are elaborate and some quite funny the centerpiece of the is journey into hell allen playing sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil who looks lot like larry that story also is left uncompleted perhaps show harrys unwillingness commit even telling story the linchpin that was needed tie together the stylistic quirks of this was central character who changes and who gives us something about care that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes allen can do much better than deconstructing harry rate it on the scale and on the scale,0.0

there is no reason doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on true story but if it is an accurate picture of life on americas mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had much stronger basis in reality than would have previously thought for from the films outset when group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles not unlike number of movie lowlifes who recently gave madonna song close reading donnie brasco resembles more than passingly few gangster flicks once believed be works of fiction our eponymous hero johnny depp is not the cheap crook he first appears be brasco is joseph pistone an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chummingup lefty al pacino seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being wiseguy regrettably pistone learns his lessons all too well his concern for lefty who is burdened heroin addicted son exacerbates his own family troubles his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husbands gangster persona is becoming little too convincing true the focus on pistones family life does deviate from the typical gangsterflick formula but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawnout domestic squabbles including an illadvised marriage guidance routine that slow the down unnecessarily the biggest problem donnie brasco however is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the but not the consistent and blindingly tacky style loved those fluoro coloured suits of scorces costume drama casino more importantly pacinos presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in similar territory was covered far more effectively donnie brascos take on american values for instance is feeble and obvious lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment the accompaniment of grating inspirational music inexplicably leftys horatio alger inspired gush is supposed move us it does not any more than his family troubles do are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistones just think minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface in these pictures pacinos dedication peculiar and bloody hypercapitalism was twisted and confronting while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations donnie brascos tawdry little crime therefore is not so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes but the shameless way in it sanitises them oh and the way forgot mention that the script also sports startling subplot pipstones superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated his constant insubordination is that damn you mcbain hear from springfield way so the movie is cliched big deal what do you expect from gangsterflick well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going be decent example of the genre donnie brasco fails on both counts the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depps woeful performance tends smother the goodwork of his comrades admittedly pacino does nothing new and michael madsen sonny simply smirks his way through the picture like slightly subdued mr white but both possess an unmistakable sly charm depp usually exhibits bit of class himself but regrettably being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him starstruck for he is completely hellbent on mimicking pacinos wellearned high style the consequences are painful watch its no exaggeration say that the films credibility is seriously strained the sight of the pistone familys uncanny ability keep straight face in front of their breadwinners phony brooklyn accent perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco maybe scrupulous adherence pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks if this is indeed the case surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that americas underworld is committed emulating albeit in heavily attenuated form their movie namesakes depp could have poignantly played simple cop who becomes hideous parody once he is forced mimic bigscreen gangster greats who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen but then again perhaps donnie brasco is not so true after all,0.0

i have never been so confused after watching movie meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score then you will wait for something happen for half an hour but when you finally understand what is going on you will wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in like this the script is simply silly and unresolved story is artificially stretched into three hour long motion picture it feels like an eternity most of the time it is pompous soap opera filled empty dialogue that the actors deliver in high pitched voice and meaningful winks the is based on alberto caesellas play death takes holiday the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives fulfilled life as successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears voice that is saying yes soon he meets young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death it is bills time but death has other plans it has come down us simple mortals find out what it means be alive our bill is chosen be deaths guide and in exchange he gets time bill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyones attention bills business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bills side lives in his house and resides at his office that is not all however bills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love her this relationship is bound have some serious consequences it would not be fair say that this did not have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited join bills family for dinner when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different it is obvious that story like this story is very difficult structure it is one thing say would not it be fun have death take human form and come down earth create motion picture out of this is another four screenwriters have worked on script that lacks drive and logic it is overlong and too primitive pass as serious on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and very decent direction martin brest scent of woman hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the from complete embarrassment but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time how can you play death in human form me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated earthly matters they are not creatures but phenomenas saying that death takes human form would be the same as suggest that eternity would take human form handling such ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work speaking in calm soft voice portraying death as lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar practical earthly matters he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than demon or redeyed executioner claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters their limits unfortunately their performances are not enough rescue this from its self inflicted misery in other words this is not what expected from the director of scent of woman it could and should be better such cast and crew in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on ravishingly looking soap opera,0.0

keep cool chinese directed semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international festival on the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance get good seat in the theater they need not have wasted their time the movie is billed as comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click wondered if there were jokes that was not getting because am not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor could not be attributed the cultural barrier either keep cool just is not very funny the prelude the was visit keep cools producer who the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order get the print the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china hawaii although the print made it the assistants luggage was lost too bad that story was not in the movie because it got big laugh qu ying the films female lead was also on hand give few comments however whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up speed ms ying saw fit say everything she had say in one fastpaced incredibly long tirade it was dizzying good foreshadowing for the you see keep cool is filmed almost totally camera handheld man bad case of the shakes at least that is the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving cinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has headache is another although some might consider it form helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying headache as said the is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying they used be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship the first half of the is about the young mans plan win her back of course the thing is she does not want be won back and has nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit in the fight the young man grabs laptop computer belonging bystander and attempts use it fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against lamppost we later find out that the laptop belongs an older man who wishes get his damaged computer replaced there is funny scene the only one in the where the young man tries use some twisted logic in order get the older man seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order recoup his losses there is no sense be made out of the young womans behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character the bookseller would be better off without her although the second half of the causes us lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man while the bookseller is blinded his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries rationalize each situation his quest end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify but it is frustrating see that he seems be talking brick wall half the time friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the for the audience appreciate although only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we do not see her from the midpoint on case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half but of course this would have shortened the movie less than an hour there are few things that keep cool does right as mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good although it grows tiresome the reasoning the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations in one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner the nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge unfortunately these crumbs are not enough overcome the rest of the films shortcomings and were not enough prevent that headache from lingering after left the theater,0.0
although had not been viewer of the rugrats television series went into their first animated feature the rugrats movie positive attitude the trailer looked cute enough after all after seeing it think the words in my recent antz review in stated that it was the worst of its type since the pebble and the penguin were bit premature the rugrats movie is bottomofthebarrel childrens fare at its worst and starts make antz look good in comparison as in the show the rugrats movie is about group of very little friends ranging from babies threeyearold the head of the group tommy pickles g daily becomes distraught when his mother has newborn baby named dill get it dill pickles hardeeharhar and is informed his threeyearold cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children when the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back the hospital tommy goes along it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been potentially fun family and there were many different things that could have been done the story so what did the writers choose do why they set up protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over waterfall of course for the youngest of children ages the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience saw this of course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling stay awake and that included me for an adult the rugrats movie is piece of garbage the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm there is not one laugh be had in the nor is there any excitement if anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it was not service more quality the rugrats movie is doa from the start am all for worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated comes along that is simply awful as said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this for adults it is nearly unbearable excruciating chore sit through as for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring parents do yourselves favor and take your kids see the rerelease of the wizard of oz that is picture that contains great deal of magic and wonder two things of the rugrats movie is completely missing,0.0

fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen the opens footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about years old doing some research in chernobyl some shady s government guys appear and ask him come an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like giant lizard and what is more this beast is heading for new york gulp although godzilla should be non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie the main faults lie the acting and writing common problems summer blockbuster movies broderick is pretty useless as the hero no humour or tough guy image while emmerichs previous summer flick independence day had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither also maria pitillo as brodericks former girlfriend is just as useless chronic disability in acting she is incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she is total crap it is up french actor jean reno save the day and indeed he does turning in campy performance as french secret agent shame he has such little screen time in such overlong hank azaria also turns up as crazy cameraman named animal and he adds little life the picture also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as slimy news reporter k so the acting is not up par but it never is in these movies but what about the script well that is not up par either emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot write script the dialogue is banal broderick looks at lot of fish and utters that is lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant broderick forever remains geeky scientist also the is seriously lacking sense of humour the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there is an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene ha ha ha ha the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park having lots of baby godzillas e velicorapters running around new york right so the script and acting suck but what about the special effects thankfully they are are quite good godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we do not see much of him because the movie is so dark the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell but although they are impressive they cannot save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it cannot seem decide on ending and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for sequel let us just hope one never arrives,0.0

well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films in domain that he owns it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell good action script from bad one eraser back in was confused that made no attempt at all make sense batman and robin in was the black sheep of the batman series ridiculous acting idiotic action scenes and painfully flashy costumes now in end of days not the end of days is the third strike in tough at bat for arnold is this the end of powerful action stars longlived career will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past terminator terminator judgement day predator or an unforgettable performance in great guilty pleasure like those in the past commando red sonja true lies it does not look that way end of days begins the birth of baby girl in who inexorably due the formation of the stars on that night will be the carrier of satans baby the hour before new years of fortunately for the movies sake the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan skyscrapers subway trains in dark tunnels and myriad of inept nypd officers it is an action films dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff blow up imagine if the girl had lived in anytown usa where the only thing destroy is dairy queen and post office arnold schwarzenegger jericho cane in series of boring events finds himself in the middle of religious battle between the church who is trying hide the girl or in some cases trying kill her and satan gabriel byrne who is trying make her pregnant if the devil is successful the world will no longer exist as we know it jericho feels it is his duty protect the girl from everyone because he once had faith but no longer does and his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it jericho cane is your cliched bythenumbers hero right up his name arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can he shouts at everyone from cops priests the devil in one truly hilarious scene was supposed be the ultimate dramatic high point jericho screams the devil you are choir boy you are choir boy those two lines marked the high points of this movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor end of days fails contain any memorable performances the exception of gabriel byrne byrne playing man who has been made the manifestation of the devil seems be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie he wonderfully plays manipulative villain the power control everyone at any time the annoying thing about his character however is that he has the power kill any human simple punch in the face yet he finds it impossible seriously hurt jericho can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody the other actors in the give very weak and unconvincing performances kevin pollak who plays the partner and close friend of jericho is the supposedly funny character in the every action movie has one the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satans baby extreme annoyance she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter or any of the viewers in the audience in one unnecessary scene tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off is this her job in the the actors are not blame entirely because the script is terrible you can tell script is terrible when you are able predict what will happen minutes before it does this little prediction game is very fun exception trying sit through this nonsense of movie in last attempt make this movie good special effects are used try entertain the audience but without memorable action scene in the whole the director has not done his job successfully this would have gotten c if arnold stood in front of camera and shouted you are choir boy for two hours,0.0
whether or not would be considered trekker probably depends on whom you would ask have been fan of both the original series and its recently retired followup as well as the even numbered entries in the series however have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs data somewhere along the line the star trek series began seem more and more directed at those in the latter category and star trek generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction its production values may be high but the writing is frequently appalling and instead of script has collection of references injokes and illdefined characters generations opens in the late rd century where members of the original enterprise crew including captain james kirk william shatner are present for the christening of the latest ship bear that name no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than distress signal brings them the nexus mysterious ribbon of energy among those rescued from the nexus is longlived alien dr soran malcolm mcdowell but he is nonetoopleased at being back in the real world seventyeight years later soran is still trying get back the nexus and again encounters an enterprise this one led captain jeanluc picard patrick stewart sorans plan involves destroying star an inhabited planet and the only hope for saving million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains do not think it is an insult fans of star trek suggest that certain extent the particulars of plot are not really the most important elements in trek it is about chance visit old friends and if they are involved in truly interesting story it can be considered gravy but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has be consistent and in generations that just does not happen data brent spiner is particularly victimized this sloppy writing in the films major subplot data decides use chip will give him human emotions chip he has had in his possession for over year what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step he does not get joke once the chip is in place spiner gets have lot of fun datas new emotions but the point is that he is no longer the data we know if the rest of the next generation cast fares any better it is only because they are on the screen so little that they are simply window dressing but then again this story is not really about the new crew it is about kirk and picard the cowboy and the politician sharing the screen the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away perhaps because he knows this is his last goround in the part that made him legend shatner looks like he is having the time of his life stewart on the other hand borders on the deferrential and is saddled the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast stewarts edginess is indicative of what may be very bad sign for paramounts hopes turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was these are clearly the not ready for big screen players contrast the prologue features scotty james doohan and chekhov walter koenig is the highlight of the these characters have become part of the popular mythology and when they take over the enterprise in moment of distress it is moment of high energy only thirty years of history can create moment like that and that is time this new crew does not have it certainly does not help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need leave trail of bread crumbs find your way out again it is also loaded little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough the series turn all their friends in shared nudge of recognition wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold the trek universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored what is going on and what waste of malcolm mcdowell who could have been great monomanical villain but should have been given much more compelling reason for his obsession there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity pick at but do so would be ignore generations major flaws however would like make one recommendation seatbelts not just for the enterprise crew although you would think the th century space travel would not involve rolling around on the floor during battle no think the audience might need them more this journey is one bumpy ride,0.0
they should have stuck the promise emblazoned on the original movies poster no sequel scary movie is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera do not try what defeats them is the genre they have chosen spoof the first movie an outrageous lowbrow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and know what you did last summer succeeded because of its takenoprisoners attitude toward type of that was in vogue familiar and popular in scary movie the filmmakers take on the haunted houseghost story format if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series scary movie does start off promising wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn of course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive but this precredit sequence has nothing at all do the main action features the cast members from the original signing up spend weekend at creepy haunted mansion as part of university class project some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that takenoprisoners bite that raised scary movie the heights of burlesque scary movie merely lurches from one lame sendup another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in everyone does acrobatics basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woos mission impossible and charlies angels it is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in blender and hoped they would coalesce they do not while the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves the speed of an wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up steep mountain road you can almost hear the reels panting scary movie tries very hard live up its original but it falls very short it is dissatisfying spectacle very weak sister of very good movie the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is,0.0
vikings bears no this is not the lineup for monday night football rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle the death in the th warrior that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory based on michael crichtons book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up sword luckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this antonio bandaras is ahmed travelling ambassador accompanied his friend omar shariff in cameo they eventually come across small viking village we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude they laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won but their festivities are about be halted when messenger boy arrives tell the village leader that great evil is threatening their land help is needed quickly an elderly fortunetelling witch arrives after brief incantation she proclaims that warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed ensure victory personally always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity nonetheless men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal th the group then sets out do the greatest battle of their lives of course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other burly viking warriors but he ably shows that it is not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog he is able overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside it does not look promising these creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale they are fearless and display desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies they attack the hundreds and the next strike will come soon the warriors prepare their defenses and pray their gods they are ready sacrifice their lives this is good way die says one of the fallen warriors despite the largerthanlife battle sequences was unmoved the entire experience at many points was even confused for example somewhere in the middle of the subplot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land he seems have an agenda elevate himself greater power during this crisis however the subplot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as the purpose of its inclusion there are other questions that had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters love or hate the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma however banderass role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the th warrior makes him so special an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order also much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night made battles very difficult follow would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision do battle against the enemy as it stands the manages more confusion than intensity it would make thor cry,0.0

the generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid we will see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever it is confusing critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction that however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller the punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has brain in its head even as the remaining of the narrative punches you in the face its lack of common sense our hero is warrant officer paul brenner brash investigator for the s armys criminal investigation division his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at georgia base the victim found tied the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation complicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee general campbell wants keep the case out of the press gives brenner only the hours before the fbi steps in teamed rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had romantic relationship brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid if only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed filteredlight sleaze director simon west likely thinks he is covered himself juxtaposing these images of violence sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches is the films fatal flaw it is trend he continues for two hours taking the storys few virtues and slapping coat of moronproof obviousness over them characters who may wink wink turn out be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans west just cannot help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter he even turns scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines distract you from its smell the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off captain campbells mentor psychological warfare expert named moore james woods there is something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another indeed travolta gets sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures the local sheriff of the georgia county should not you be out nightsticking the colored folk even the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides few winning zingers goldmans dialogue can serve up bigger laugh than you will find in most socalled comedies dialogue unfortunately just is not enough make quality script it is difficult take movie about criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid solve it sooner an idiotic inability recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought psychointherain finale wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the occasionally fun it is silly and pretentious filmmaking but at least it provides giggle or five goldman should tear the decent pages out of this script and turn them into standup routine,0.0
cradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins while he may have had an oscar worthy back in dead man walking he gets little overconfident and sloppy here the story is confusing and filled many subplots so will try my best and explain it as simply as possible the is based on mostly true story about federal theater in the that produced play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive some so the government shuts it down it is during the time of the depression and all this theater wants do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor between this conflict lies what seems like subplots about those who work in theater or those associated also along the way are some other messages mashed together create an even more overwhelming experience tim robbins just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the or in some cases walk out for robbins it may be nice achievement but me it seemed more like friendly get together slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits thought the main reason for seeing the would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for few let me recap what each important character does so please bear me it is the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this will begin those involved the play there is orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson woman who gets her break playing the main part in cradle will rock outside the play there is the ventriloquist bill murray who wants relationship federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving painter diego rivera ruben blades who is unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed nelson rockefeller because he feels it be an outrage john cusack there is few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name few but those that mentioned were the most significant the story anyway most of these talented stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin now although most of the was weak say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown sure the free speech segment was nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive the whole is like this and it is basically nothing but headache on the brighter side tim robbins direction was masterful his camera direction seemed reminiscent the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that cannot make movie that much better although it has it is moments not many of them but they are there cradle will rock stays true it is title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over,0.0
disillusioned and trying find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand there he meets crazed man the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him map beach secret utopia then commits suicide richard sets off for this beach his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen once they get there the three discover secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise this covers about half two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element is solely creation of seems hold the original novel the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking do not think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning but that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking the plot of the movie moves along at decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts this is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is turn for the better yes folks said better now up about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise this is where things start degenerate something that becomes almost unwatchable there is even video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it does not make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and am hoping many other peoples am hoping that in my little rant have made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you do not like it because of this do not blame me the character development was not up par either found the character of richard be nothing more than spoiled child although there is feeble attempt make this whole story profound it fails and richard leos character comes off as wannabe philosopher the character seems be underdeveloped from the get go and seems just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but nor anyone know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough richard is obviously obsessed fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line this am sure contributes the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused now shall move onto something little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have few good things about it the cast and acting was passable at the very least and think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard mind you think the rest of the cast that had some had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better begs the question why is leonardo paid so much think this is topic all on its own so will not get into it but like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used can see this movie being horrible the international flavor added more global feel the movie that made it that much more bearable not mention the movie is set in thailand and global cast makes more sense when all is said and done liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable would not recommend this movie anyone the fact that liked it has lot do the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story as it is the story tries be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt if you do end up going see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings,0.0

this review contains spoilers but believe me do not say anything you cannot guess minutes into the movie did go into this one high expectations had been exposed media reports that this would signify departure from the slasher flicks sort of expected another exorcist or the shining even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of boy was wrong another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has story the story you ask well scumball buys chinese puzzle from guy in an arab souk he takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling it in his attic lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but meat hooks when they are finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling they botch up their cleanup job however and manage leave his heart or some gland did not really recognize the organ under floorboard the guys brother and his brothers wife appear at the door soon after and decide move in they throw away scumballs belongings and set up house turns out that wife is bit of nympho and screwed around scumball right before her marriage she starts having some wild hallucinations later hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slowmo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the groundall from the tiny cut on his hand said blood is eagerly sucked up scumballs organ the organ grows into thing that requires yet more blood in order complete the regeneration into really ugly thing it establishes mind contact wife who agrees help him get more blood because she really wants be screwed again so she helps him kill three businessmen scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back problem is he does not have any skin and even after three or four corpses still does not get any skin he finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother guess they could not get the original actor back who knows scumball whose name is frank is not nice guy he describes his torture the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two somehow do not see getting torn apart fish and meathooks lot of fun this guy is so bad how bad is he so bad that the rats cower in corner in fear for good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves third while the nymphos horsing around hubby anyway hubbys daughter who if course is not wifes daughter starts suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic one of her johns and the ensuing screams the dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed she manages escape the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons at any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they are normally quite meticulous about that type of thing the story boils down the demons trying correct their mistake the demons are not however the good guys the dumb bimbos the good guy she somehow not only gets them take care of frank but also banishes them hell or oblivion we are not too sure not too shabby for someone singledigit iq this is basically bad jinn story it is an awful movie awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated meathooks is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is continuity who cares acting terrible script horrible sounds canned unrealistic story is soso but the impact is lost long long before the ends do think the rat acting was quite good have never seen rats look afraid they should get nominated for an award really good acting there the best in the movie the envelope for best furry rodent please rating would be far too generous rating or in the rating system is far more accurate this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog can see this turning into the next rocky horror picture show people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up the characters on the screen had have something do dumb dumb dumb movie was embarrassed that spent money see it it goes without saying that disagree the other reviews on the board that attempt review the for itself lots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion,0.0
have you ever heard the one about movie so bad that it made guy run out of the theatre screaming obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut this is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of ripoffs from the most pointless movies of all time amy jennifer morrison is student who is attending school filled uninspired students who do not have clue about what do but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious universitys program where each years best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize virtual oneway ticket success she has chance encounter campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy try her hand at fictional thriller organized along similar lines soon enough fake and real blood starts flow and amy is being chased around scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one one is the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on this is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting it simply lacks the ability and the story entertain the body counts and screams continue grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly in fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping serious face several times tried prevent myself from laughing without succeeding and then realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing it is the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century how many times must we tolerate the same clich that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them they are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence however director john ottman manages make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre what was done sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously for that reason alone it is worth look just realize how bad movie can be it is tough find comparisons for such an achievement and we have dig in ancient history find movie that would match its intellect even movies like lost in space and mission mars seem spectacular in its shadow we have not seen such waste of ime and resources since showgirls no matter how hard tried find positive elements in this so called production came up nothing except the way the killer was dressed here feel that have compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and mariesylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known screammask very elegant fencing mask jennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping straight face when pronouncing the words from the script in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this the exception of its screenplay is its portray of schools if these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywoods golden days are over rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing third installment let us just hope and pray that it is just an urban legend,0.0

i wont even pretend that have seen the other alien films saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but have no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies was munching into after hard days work didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien years later scientists use sample of blood found at the site of her death recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able withhold greater pain than normal being im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesnt take genius figure out that the rest of the is continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth theres little saying that goes something like this if youre going make bad do it well have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection good example of that really gets up my nose is not so much discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way describe why the australian ma rating was given this other than unnecessary and repulsive gore attempts distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as witnessed mawkish looking alien put its hand on characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking knife through her hand just impress someone she was talking fair enough if it were in horror or even if it bared any significance the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think im struggling find one good aspect about the then you thought right one exciting scene is credit and the only part remotely worth seeing the in an alien chases two men one cripple up tall ladder interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in where the one liners come as bad as earth man what shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is bounce bullets off walls hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less enjoy the more eat so all the lollies were gone in minutes but however empty the bag turned out be it was still long way ahead of the movie,0.0

this is that was inclined like at the outset the two main characters had been involved the fine television drama st elsewhere for several years and had understood that the directorscreenwriter had written for the show on occasion also am sorry report that the results were not up my expectations nor were they satisfactory if had list reason why but that would be getting ahead of myself besides it is not immediately clear as there are so many problems the adam arkin plays gradeschool teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but good teacher he spends his lunches playing basketball himself on nearby court one day he meets drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st elsewhere in the park and inveigles him in game of oneonone basketball morse turns out be good and friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching and morses selling of paper flowers passing motorists so far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack good music be sure but it does not replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the somewhat minimalistic technique rarely admire suddenly their friendship is interrupted morses introduction fellow teacher of arkins woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent approach it appears that she begins admire morse who enjoys here attentions but is not sure what do about itshe does not realize that he is drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else until then had only vague dissatisfaction the the conclusion is where it begins evolve into fullfledged failure the woman at least me appeared be fairly shallow did not realize how shallow until her final scene arkin where she reveals that she has been trying make arkin jealous her attentions morse somehow this is made appear as if it is arkins fault and it is left him feeling somehow victorious that he is gotten such find of girlfriend frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least after this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural if had summarize major gripe it is that this is story spread too thin that creates semilikable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being yearolds at the last moment it might be truetolife some people but that does not mean have like it do not avoid,0.0
i love movies really do every time watch great movies like goodfellas or raiders of the lost ark tear comes my eye due the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display even lower grade films such as the naked gun or ghostbusters ii while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not waste of celluloid and present entertainment value then there is my favourite martian the exact opposite of what movie should be hurried poorly written and acted movie one goal make money disney ever since the lion king have lost their magic touch but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk christopher lloyd plays martian who crash lands in front of v reporters tim ohara car daniels and soon tim finds the martian in his home trying recover and fix his spaceship along his zoot spacesuit voiced wayne knight must fix his spaceship before it explodes and also try stop his identity being revealed the public firstly ohara but later rival v presenter brace channing hurley calling himself tims uncle martin laughter is supposed arise from the comical events but never does many bad films have good intentions but my favourite martian does not appear try provide any entertainment filled the brim wham bang special effects my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie have never seen man pull face for minutes until now jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless his performance is incredibly lazy although his paperthin character does not deserve more than the performance he gives darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever but her role is somewhat erm limited hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating godawful performance in moving picture way go liz for the supporting cast disney manage assemble every character actor out there during the was going he was the guy in ah er before finally giving up and switching off another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick unfortunately the writers sherri stoner and deanna oliver if anyone cares forget that comedy sidekick needs be funny instead they deliver zoot the martians deeply unfunny sidekick although meant be manic character no doubt every line that comes out of his neck is dud real dud citizen kane delivers more laughs minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester even the kids in the audience were insulted this character not one child even bothered smirk it is nice special effect though another problems this comedy are the gags themselves or rather the lack of them my favourite martian reaches new level of toilet humour it goes past the bowl down the pipe and into the sewer now toilet humour can be funny as dumb and dumber humorously showed but here characters farting belching and almost getting crapped on literally is not amusing it is insulting there is one good gag right before the credits but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued either that or they were hoping that easy please six year olds would not mind the fact that his movie is beaten men at work in the funny stakes yes men at work yowza the fact that lot of money was pumped into this and that they actually got people agree be in this just depresses me even more there are thousands of brilliant films out there that cannot get distribution yet trash like this gets released nationwide ease thankfully as soon as it makes it is money it will never be seen again and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie down the toilet,0.0
i looked at the internet movie database awards section for this and found that this was nominated for golden globe for best picture drama anyone who is seen this can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and that is not really saying lot for this earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured on video it is bland and slowmoving gives us bunch of different characters the disaster requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster while this worked in say the towering inferno it does not here for one single reason we do not care about any of the characters the gives us charlton heston in one of many crap films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as rich man married ava gardner who is having little affair young single mom genieveve bujold renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot military manbag boy at grocery store who has little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair in smaller subplots there is pointless bit about people who are flying over a the city in the the way one who is playing cards and married boring nonacting husband you think this one can go nowhere guess again he gets interested in the final frames there is genieveve bujolds moron son who has little adventure wires and for some muchneeded comedy there is walter matthau billed as walter mutha the only laugh in the as wild drunkard who is big moment is dance he does at critical time as for the actual earthquake it is rather letdown there is full hour of charactersetups none of is interesting then about minutes of shaking crumbling and bit where house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing this needed that whole theatreshaking they needed wake everybody up because they were so bored there is little suspense following the quake although this tries for it there is an adventure in crumbling highrise office building the wires the kid and the movement of people who are all injured but none of these are alltoo suspenseful the finale the hestongardnerbujold love triangle is ended in basic flipofthecoin bit brings out big letdown and there is no real finale even volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked not only is it hokey but you do not care about any character who cares if heston dies who cares if he choses bujold or gardner although would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt who cares if that idiot kid falls his death on some wires and who cares about that whole plane spiel if anything earthquake is worth viewing for the same reason glen or glenda is mean laughed at this more than did at bio dome but that is another story and review in short earthquake gives disaster pics bad name,0.0
the formula is simple trap varied group of people on an isolated location then pop in seemingly unstoppable monster kill them one one these have been the successful ingredients for many good films the thing alien aliens and tremors name few so why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad see the relic for particularly putrid example perhaps it is simply too easy forget the necessary binding ingredient effort and ideas deep rising meets these two requirements part way but not enough salvage the treat williams is finnegan the leader of small boat crew who hire out their services and their boat for any activity no questions asked this time however they may have gone too far their passengers led the ominous wes studi are the type of multinational terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films and their cargo let us just say it has very high explosive potential what is the target of these thieves why the argonauticus of course high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage but something else is hunting the argonauticus something ancient and deadly the time the thieves arrive nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed and now the creature senses fresh meat so you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew joining forces the surviving passengers including the ship owner canton anthony heald and thief less lofty goals trillian famke janssen against the terror from the deep and the monster gets pick them off one one fortunately for the creature this particular band of criminals happens be the dumbest the world can offer why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food if there is more clarion call for unity do not know what it might be it is pretty easy guess who will get killed off when there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem last until the end for the most part the watery tentacles seem be acting on the audiences impulses get rid of the most boring characters first although wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsous life bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad treat williams is passable hero and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way the biggest treat in the however has be pantucci kevin oconnors whining engineboy under finnegans employ his constant quips may be bit overwritten but they manage capture the same vein of nerveaddled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens or todd graff as hippie in the abyss for that matter it is just stock part the comicrelief character but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable as far as the monster goes although the cgi is done well the creature has no logical consistency think back the great or even just good movie monsters they all had set of rules about what they could do and how and why they would do it part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering along the heroes just what those rules are the tentacle monster in deep rising does not have set of rules or if it does not very good one it merely eats or drinks as the case may be and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order do so the never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place it simply happens the action scenes are decent but few are noteworthy the definitely does suffer from its proximity titanic deep risings peril in the water scenes pale next camerons but can you really blame them unfortunately deep risings efforts are more on par speed on the plus side however the films closing image shows some promise for potentially interesting but unlikely sequel perhaps you would be better off waiting for that one,0.0

i think maybe it is time for the batman series be put rest not only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone make himself into superhero been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for allout camp few traces of the selfmocking restraint of the relatively lighthearted third installment let me give you an example in the first scene of the movie batman george clooney and robin chris odonnell are summoned museum that has been literally turned ice mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger in an attempt steal diamond mr freezes thugs are armed none other than hockey sticks but this is no problem for our heroes automatic skates shoot out of their shoes at point robin manages get hold of hockey stick grabs the diamond and stickhandles it through the museum might have expected this from an airplanestyle farce but do not think that is what this movie is supposed be after all the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic the standards of the superheroaction genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts minimum while playing the obligatory cheesiness at least some amount of irony not any more the list goes on and on in this one robin holds onto the outside of flying rocket ship feet high in the atmosphere climbing in the door save batman mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman leap from skyscraper and survive landing in small pond world dominating mad scientist lives in fortress that seems have been stolen from the old heman cartoons my very favorite example is the scene in batgirl alicia silverstone gets in race motorcycle thugs during they come up the clever notion of dousing the road gasoline and setting it on fire distract her not bad but would not the police or maybe batman notice if the road was on fire knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place but it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment as if three protagonists and two villains were not enough batman and robin further weighs itself down an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce waynes butler alfred michael gough might have seemed poignant if it was not surrounded so much silliness as well as several scenes elle macpherson as bruces girlfriend serve no purpose other than remind us that she is in the movie all this might be semiexcusable if the story were interesting and entertaining but it is not in fact it is kind of boring mr freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin their evil plot is as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words today gotham city tomorrow the world as it is lamebrained did not it ever occur poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too and robins constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bullheaded and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as partner in the first place strip away the stars the fancy set design and the status as batman movie and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick,0.0

as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment does not loose the oppertunity get involved telling stories and expressing opinions this centers on relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel jackson they fought side side in vietnam where childers saved hodges life shooting an unarmed pow that is against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances certainly hodges is not complaining years pass hodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets law degree and becomes marine lawyer childers is now respected and muchdecorated hero that has served his country his life and sould because of his excellent record childers is sent yemen rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops childers does what he has do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops shoot into the firing crowd more than yemeni men women and children are mowed down childers is immediately accused of ordering his men fire on crowd and murder of unarmed civilians he persuades his old friend hodges represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the did childers violate authorized s military rules of engagement or are there simply no rules in war the answers these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions the murder of innocent civilians has result into something greater than simple trial in the s where is the accusations from the arab leaders where is the n the ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena this in way akin films such as few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism these accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking one of the earliest apparent problems rules of engagement is its lack of credibility the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if chain of events had happen in particular manner in order for the plot proceed lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality that is precisely why it is not offensive it is completely unobjective many stories are started and never finished many questions are asked but never answered lot of parallels are referring nothing it seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their is it about arab mentality americas foreign policies americas role in the world corruption in the higher circles it goes on and on it consists of countless stories but not definable plot it tries be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one think that it is ironic because director william friedkins probably most acclaimed was the exorcist had silly story but became rather effective in this case you have strong story many possibilities and the result is silly though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest does simply not engage believe that friedklin is director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order succeed it is obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore catastrophe the characters feel designed unreal merely shadows no life outside the conflict even the actors can not save this from going under though both jackson and jones act admirably performances that are as good as you get script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of they have roles that they could play blindfolded their hand on the back jackson is gray and jones uninteresting the rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks the time has come for the verdict on the charges of complete lack of objectivity find this guilty on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking find it guilty but on the charges of racism find this not guilty because of it is inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population must admit that the is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical badguys this is very sad since in time like this it is crucial not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth however it is absolutely necessary remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in

the characters in jonathan lynns the whole nine yards yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies analyze this and mickey blue eyes gun shy are rarely ever written as real people but merely as onedimensional caricatures when an added layer one of their personalities is revealed it is not service the character development or naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but accommodate the convoluted plot in lightweight comedy you might say it is not required have perfectly realized figures just as long as they get the job done unfortunately for comedy work it has at least succeed at being funny and if there was laughometer available would guess that it briefly ascended around of the time for me suffice say the comedy in the whole nine yards works about as well as the brokendown lawnmower in my backyard and when giggle surprisingly arises every twenty thirty minutes it is sheer luck nicholas oz oseransky matthew perry is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec trapped in hateful marriage the conniving sophie rosanna arquette delightfully hamming it up clearly artificial frenchcanadian accent one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house nextdoor walking over greet him he is horrified discover it is jimmy the tulip tudeski bruce willis former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison once getting know him and becoming his friend oz is more comfortable his identity but for sophie it means possible hitman do away oz in her scheme sophie sends oz chicago cash in informing his old mob boss kevin pollak about jimmys whereabouts but in the process he falls in love jimmys wife cynthia natasha henstridge who is being held hostage upon return quebec and one contrivance after the next ozs dental assistant jill amanda peet is overjoyed discover that he lives beside the tulip and forces him set up meeting since jills dream in life turns out being contract killer herself have you got all that because there is more much much more and this is movie that without credits is little over minutes and feels only like an hour the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set far superior pictures how the cast most of are respectable actors got caught up in such cliched deficient remains mystery unless they thought it might aspire match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns comedy classic clue the movie going into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but the twentyminute mark when had chuckled once and laughed nary single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written mitchell kapner collapses every failing comedy bit the is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness become professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark few select actors do what they can the material while others make no impact at all on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis perry innocuously enjoyable on tvs friends plays the same exact sitcomstyle character in all of his movies from fools rush in three tango and it has become crushing bore meanwhile willis makes next no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background their three female counterparts fare noticeably better best of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion cynthia henstridge has the talent for sure break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent amanda peet has lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on career based solely on comedy it is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked disrobe in climactic scene the obvious sole purpose being show off her breasts finally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time also popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs when the whole nine yards eventually sputters its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such ever got greenlit great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but duplication of better films so what was the point without passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all now what does that tell you,0.0

once upon time jeanclaude van damme was decent action hero the muscles from brussels bursted into the market mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martialarts ability some of these excursions were fun but now it seems like watching van damme movie has become painful chore no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mindnumbing action and when the action goes sour what is there left enjoy will explain knock off is about pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong marcus ray van damme babemagnet and stylish dresser heads up the company an annoying weasel of partner rob schneider they become part of plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly mole in the business am going reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one am not quite sure who gives crap but will issue warning anyhow tommy is really working the cia his boss very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants cause carnage these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons he even stoops so low put them into childrens toys if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off if you think that this ridiculous setup could not even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea knock off sucks it stoops ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares it amazes me how far these producers will go sell something simply because van damme is the star the plot is pathetic garbage strung together inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them row canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe director tsui hark who teamed van damme in the superior but still lamebrained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt dazzle us fantastic camera angles than engage us the plot suppose enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired it all sounds very cool trust me it is not as much as it scars me say this har har van damme is terrible sure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates the greatest of ease he looks like he is doing bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired hate say it but perhaps it is time for mr van damme give up his day job it is really test of endurance watching knock off suppose there is some enjoyment derived from schneiders character who is extremely annoying but provides the films better moments and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter knock off does not even stand strong as mindless but entertaining action like handful of van dammes others no this movie is an embarrassment the entire action genre of modern filmmaking and considering how low has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much note self avoid universal soldier the return upon release in august,0.0

this is the worst movie have seen since the so bad walked out on it jingle all the way it is crap on toast made of crap baked in an oven fueled crap it is crap through and through nothing works in this as be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable in his entire career that being cousins heres man who admits he is medicore director rather charmingly selfeffacing statement but truth be told he is much worse than mediocre not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed write ever again there is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring they set up mr freeze as tragic figure trying cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character giving him the lamest oneliners it turns him into stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of brooding scientist who has spent much of his life bringing his wife from the brink of death but that is par for course nothing in this makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines as mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue spit out at once this is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass personally think that he has more pull the directors and does not retake scenes make him understandable compare his dialogue in the terminator series the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin apparently james cameron knows how get competent performance out of arnold uma thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either her poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right and her pamela isley scenes are marred subsnl standard acting as if she is reading off cue cards and is about laugh at any given moment given the script it is wonder it did not happen more frequently there is no redeeming feature in this not george clooney as batman chris odonnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted his cadaverous appearance in fact there was something unsettling about his appearance seems have been accomplished without any makeup tricks looking as if it were scenes from documentary about dying man unfortunately every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed impart the movie is rife poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of big battle you know there is bunch of people but instead of melee schumacher decided focus on foot or fist there is never moment of awe wonder or mayhem the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects are impressive and probably expensive even then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable the hockey team from hell not even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off nothing say or do blink and you will miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as why is she even in the vamp in freezes lair all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had and in what almost seems like an effort save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she is not even filmed well enough look good trust me she is quite attractive outside of this dreck and as if the were not bad enough limp along bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore know it is nitpicky ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the characters arms are not ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish onearmed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freezes weapon creates tons if ice that is all traditional comic book stuff but why does batman spring trap for freeze at public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of bystanders why is there big switch clearly marked heat in mr freezes lair why do countless bumbling police officers even try take on mr freeze hand hand why does alfred encourage silverstone become batgirl and even go so far as have suit made for her why do batman robin take minutes bicker before leaving the batcave in response an emergency and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why do not they wear masks filter it out could go on and on batman robin is braindead pointless garish loud that should still reign as the worst of the year the time rolls along note warner bros if you are going make another batman please replace schumacher nearly anyone because it could actually get worse than this what schumacher does not understand is that comic book does not automatically equal unbearable idiocy the true equation seems be schumacher batman unbearable idiocy,0.0

the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities the best tales of the genre deal mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge such popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in strange land robert heinlein childhoods end arthur clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep philip dick all deal mans need for identity and struggle for self worth has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since it is beginnings most films just created fancy pulp tales no more thought that the escapism they achieved it really was not until producer george pal took charge of robert heinleins novel rocketship galileo and crafted the destination moon that scifi as it is commonly referred came into it is own from there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman stanley kubrick have sought express ideas through the medium of the genre the release of touchstone pictures mission mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant scifi for those who read the national enquirer and the globe the opens on summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell woos young female his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son entering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney luc consoles jim woodys assistance the three men are friends and carry fine bond of trust and caring between them but jim still longs set foot on the red planet the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars they send out the rover investigate the area and discover what seems be water or ice under the surface going out investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars strange noise emanates from the rock as the team tries scan through the rock radar violent wind storm erupts creating vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc back on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing lucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men attempt second mission the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team the second journey the martian world is fraught danger meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way the planets surface the big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars and if so what is its relationship us now for the bad news the entire plot of mission mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the revealing some of the most harebrained scifi pabulum the screen has witnessed borrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars quatermass and the pit space odyssey and even mario bavas planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio mission mars is hodgepodge of ideas that do not add up satisfying whole while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the remains flat and uninvolving so much time is giving establishing the lead characters in the but no good use the performances are all workmen like only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation and the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful excuse and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better he is just having too much fun here give damn the script has few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage this of course leads our heroes having abandon their rescue ship also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on religious demeanor that is completely at odds the situation but the biggest offence in the is the horrid intrusive score ennio morricone subtlety is nonexistent here in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out the only sequence in the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower the pacing of the is very leisurely after the opening introduction of the characters lasts full minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface then there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity the could lose about minutes and actually gain some momentum there are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going happen that it drags the dead stop the good news is that the is absolutely sumptuous look at the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted level of realism that has not been seen since space odyssey the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences the visualization of evolution on earth the only fault come the martians themselves look more like something out of plastic model kit than something from another world director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the the opening sequence alone in seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost minutes an homage hitchcocks rope as we are introduced all of the characters scenes in the rescue ship its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution but the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang sadly it is not director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production the set design and visual effects are all arresting but it is the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been fine return good adventurous thought provoking science fiction disappointing but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the

the job of the critic is see movie and write review of it that tells you what it is about and why it is good or bad feel kind of embarrassed admit this but after having seen get carter really cannot tell you what it is about although could go on and on about how and why it is bad movie get carter falls into that category of movies that continue be made for reasons unknown anyone outside of executive board room you might call them the steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school of mediocre actioncrime thrillers you know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development they have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection one of the other characters who are all antagonists without reason for being in the movie other than give the protagonist someone fight chase or shoot at sylvester stallone stars as jack carter las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home for his brothers funeral he believes his brother richie was taken out and did not die from dwi accident carters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid his face alone is pretty intimidating and there is quite few scenes in he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply staring them down and speaking confidence in his ramboontestosteronetherapy voice stallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he does not realize he is mocking himself the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death he is in town that is not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well mickey rourke costars as one of these characters sort of crime boss who has something do running porno web site and blackmailing young internet tycoon played alan cummings looking and acting lot like pee wee herman there is also another plot involving richies mistress secret cdrom some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives am rolling my eyes just thinking about trying critique all this in way that could be remotely comprehendible could just rip the screenplay shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order explain it all do not like put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally yes get carter is just that complicated and complex and what is worse is that it is not this intricate make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably did not remember what had already happened and did not figure out how each scene would lead in the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax all you really need know is that most of the is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he was not complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything comes back haunt them in one violent way or another making movie entirely about criminals does not necessarily mean they have be unlikable and cliche cutout characters mel gibson starred in payback few years ago that had story not unlike this one but had such good screenplay you could not help but like him even though he was just as bad guy as jack carter so ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has carter is not likable character and you really do not care if he gets revenge or not the action sequences are not at all exciting or original the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all cmon you know who is going win every brawl and shootout and car chase in the end you do not feel nearly satisfied the results the filmmakers did good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible the city is never mentioned name but assume it is seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it is always raining,0.0
i have got admit it am huge jim carrey fan loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumberand even in batman forever was pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people come off looking reasonably good until saw ace ventura had no idea how people could find the guy annoying sadly ace ventura shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funnyit is just rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing save raccoon in reasonable cliffhanger spoof soon he is called out of retirement find bat was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes destroy each other once again it is up ace save the day using his uncanny detective skills those who have been disappointed carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad see him overacting the best of his ability but some may be disappointed the fact that this sequel does not capture the feel of the original the original benefited from what looked be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences were hysterically funny here however the tighter script is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance improvise instead his extremely funny manner has been reduced just walking around stupidly but one of the biggest problems had was the character of ventura himself in the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one elseperfect for carreys offthewall approach but here ventura is made look lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guya role is definitely not carreys style there are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber,0.0
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of post millennium james bond adventure strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing drop kick villains than out fox them sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins bear closer resemblance souped up twohour long episode of magyuver and not particularly good one at that what went wrong mi begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us believe that it will soon give way something of plot but it only gives way more flash then digresses further into presumably unintentional parody of itself much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool early on during car chase between soon be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoffhall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic in one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down languid semistall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close toppling over neighboring cliff prior this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation another why have not the foggiest doubt even john woo could provide you logical reply mi woo has become slave the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects it is possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means get off though of course this is never explored the scenes have described are really only included titillate not give any insight into character god forbid woo certainly knows how make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals still in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much cherish cruise and newton first meet during vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is between the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make some sensuous eye contact the scene is little over the top in bon jovi music video circa kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts bit of spell on us sure it is all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens be talented maestro behind this particular product thandie and cruise later meet in bathtub in scene that is about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres newton bats her eyes flirtatiously cruise grins little too slyly the cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first here cruise plays him more as hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part he is cool and dashing is precisely the kind of role we want see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the sadly as the progresses we see less of cruises initial am the man charm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug mi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act is essentially one hour long action sequence that just will not stop the whole thing commences an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the really should be unheard of in john woo but alas this particular battle could have been staged anyone from renny harlin joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem find their way into every john woo picture we have all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing gun in each hand it is not done any differently here the action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics nothing propel it but the apparent need see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind he is cool for sure but he is made be as empty as the movie the actor is not used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during gunfight before one or after one when he is not beaming away he is staring into the lens cold eyes trying look mad as hell but woos editing seriously undermines the effort he fetishizes cruises angular face such glee that it turns into naked gun style spoof half expected cruise peel off his facemask and reveal that he is really austin powers in classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like pinup boy angel of death the gunfight turns into daring escape turns into reckless mission turns into motorcycle attack in bad guys seem angle directly for cruise kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero shoot him in mid air he does the lead bad guy played the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles though instead of jumping off the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other mid air bear hug only fly about hundred feet still in bear hug position land on beach below and begin manoemano fist fight that ends the bad guy pulling so you thought was dead not worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking sweat what hero you may have noticed that opted not describe an iota of mis plot my reasoning is simple am not sure of any good it would do the itself has absolutely no concern story only hurtling forth the next special effect was not kidding when told friend of mine that mi has less plot than the average aerosmith video nobody will go this for the plot and if they do they will surely regret it as summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down nearly nothing in mi the plot seemed be built around brian de palmas that films director stylistic flourishes while in mi the plot only serves give us an intermittent breather from woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium it is irrelevant in every sense as is character all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors,0.0
every now and then reviewers are faced the films that are hard be properly reviewed most of the time it happens films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard express his thoughts or feelings but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons love trouble happened be one of such occasions for the author of this review the impression left the was not overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it surprise me this day because the movie theatre was full was close sound speakers the show was not late and did not lack sleep before the show such things happen very rarely me and after many years the closest thing solution this mystery is probably the quality of the itself the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts two of them are assigned cover the train collision as soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other the plot in this is rather secondary its real raison tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn movie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences turning the screwball spirit into modern setting father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte young julia roberts however although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops arouse any interest it probably happens due poorly executed genre mix that collides lighthearted romantic comedy rather uninteresting plot suitable pure action thrillers shyer as director fails make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable the end result is rather forgettable effort convinced me not watch movie again will give it the benefit of the doubt though,0.0
the only two really good things that can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under minutes in length if you have not already figured it out did not like this movie very much the plot was boring and contrived the extreme tarzan casper van dien has now left the jungle and living in civilized society he is just days away from his impending marriage jane played the aptly named jane march back in his former home of africa group of looters has found the key locating lost city mind you never really figured out why they actually wanted find this city anyway tarzans old jungle friend appears him in vision tarzan realizes that he must return africa help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city he leaves jane his first mistake in my opinion and travels africa of course jane is hot on her ape mans heals the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle the bad guys sound like dumb explanation of the plot it is actually an improvement over the real thing the acting is just plain awful am not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this but it was not acting jane march was not heck of lot better but at least she is easy on the eyes compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been rerecorded and have seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies added the sound problems was the cinematography this was filled beautiful african scenery but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed me quite frankly think you could probably do better job capturing the beauty of africa camcorder than this bunch did professional equipment then we have the special effects special effects in tarzan movie you are no doubt asking yourself yes friends the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story probably for the sake of using cgi since it did nothing but hurt the story in most parts they were not bad just nothing special but they were more than little on the hokey side except of course when we got the ridiculous climax of this movie the grand finales special effects went right into the toilet at that point it almost looked like they had run out of money these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the and looked like something in an amateur video production took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors do not mix stay far away from this version of tarzan,0.0
losing job is not an all too uncommon thing reacting such personal setback taking group of small children hostage is bit more rare while we all might feel the desire blow someones head off shotgun when they do not seem grasp our point of view actually threatening them one is usually something we avoid this is not the case sam baily john travoltas slightly askew averagejoe persona in mad city do not think people listen guys like me sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of museum just few days ago sam was guard at this same museum but when cutbacks led the elimination of his security position sams apprehension resulted in brash decision in an effort get his exboss museum director mrs banks blythe danner just listen he barges into the museum one day equipped fully loaded shotgun taking the uncooperative banks and group of school children hostage sams overall concern is valid enough if he loses his job his paycheck his benefits etc his wife and two children will not be provided for he is not lunatic or hottempered madman he is somewhat like child panicky compulsive and running on emotion and his naive intentions are not helped any the fact that banks was not overly compassionate the let go overall he is just like you and me except that he has the capacity view the line we would deem far enough as the starting mark of some crazy race meanwhile television reporter max brackett dustin hoffman is also on the scene covering fluff story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggestbreaking news story he ever could have hoped for having been demoted from network newsman smalltime affiliate reporting max is anxious turn this into his and only his story max immediately bonds sam max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him use the police over the phone at first maxs intentions do not stretch beyond high ratings and good boost the ole pride factor but as he gets know sam more personally he begins sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him the media however is creating frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as diesel truck moving downhill the accidental shooting of exco worker cliff bill nunn black security guard becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sams honest ambitions also involved in this are robert prosky as lou potts head of the news department of the station max falls directly under and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander who uses his network power try and outshine max alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities then there is mia kirshner who plays the young tv station intern laurie she falls under maxs wings only become student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting kirshners credits are relatively small for now including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel the crow still kirshners character transformation shows that she has shining ability play both good girl and kindabitchyinareservedway roles would not mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts where perhaps her talent will be able blossom more fully onscreen while the viewpoint of the media as greedy selfrighteous monster has indeed been tackled before mad city provides solid two hours of enjoyability hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors and seeing them together is real treat they both do great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters and they provide enough chemistry for us genuinely care for both there is quite bit of humor in this and without it it could have fallen into drab cliched social statement more likely garner sleep from the audience than applause this is not flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart but it will lightly touch both making for recommendable movie if for nothing more than the opportunity watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time urge you check this one out,1.0
as much as wanted like this as went into it the more pleased was when left first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream you will love wild things campbell gives stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love me now onto more serious stuff and this mean that in nearly sarcastic way wild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the rating from the mpaa am not saying that in bad way but when you see this you may be shocked what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased the films charming cast and tricky plot that they let the slide an rating being mormon am bound hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not see the trouble is have already seen it and like it wild things is noir of the filled sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of culture the style in it is filmed is rich in color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this sure it is all too good be true but as not it fun watch when movies like this come along sort of better version of basic instinct there is bound be people who either love it or hate it there will be people who do not want admit liking what they see but tell you most anyone who sees this will like it wild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love get into it is almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared the average person they are gorgeous immediately the finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time we can turn off our brains right wrong while you may be expecting one thing happen it certainly does not turn out that way the begins in classroom nearly all the main characters present there is sam lombardo matt dillon counselor for the students he is heading the class discussion there is also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen who has fallen in love sam teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega who want talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone of the we are about watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body and so wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam does not want anything do her advances kelly is stubborn and continues pursue him she even pleads him let her wash his jeep surprisingly that is really all can tell you about the plot any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists and what is more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way of scream wild things maintains that films surprises and then adds even more them there are more plot twists in this than probably any have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that it is rather pleasing going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief thankfully the convoluted plot does not give us much time think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off as for the critics who complain that the is trashywell it is this is pretty much just one trashy however it is the kind of trashy that is not hard watch it is good trash in sense one the screenplay knows that it is not be taken seriously and it includes lot of humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kellys mother theresa russell who is more of caricature of rich people all the way an ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray who wears neckbrace cover an insurance scam he is running bill murray also provides the best character in the and most of the genuine laughs and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things is supposed have sex in it what that title would not and this movie breaks the boundaries instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell do not worry it is not as graphic as you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene it is very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it and for as long as can remember do not think have seen an rrated show an erect one before it is not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too also during one scene late in the there seemed be relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had cut it in order for the rating or if the actors refused do it what first made me want see wild things was its cast neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays gothic pothead the closest role this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was nice girl campbell is probably the best in the and shows her wide range of talent you can tell she will be around for long time denise richards will also be around for long time although she may be limited the roles without much range here she gets express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers hopefully one day she will land very good role that can display her ability and then there is daphne rubinvega newcomer the movies she gives very good performance although her character is mostly left the background for the first hour and half towards the end she does get bigger part on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving subtle performance that surprises every twist kevin bacon has slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it you must have admiration though for what he did on screen and judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater that shot they have grown deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right and then there is bill murray his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the as whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage troi director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of serial killer has constructed wonderfully twisty plot that works his direction is smooth and stylish the visuals are striking filled rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air however he seems more at home when the actors are not talking his flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is highlight the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see like this and we should watch it just see how the camera can take pictures then there is the music this was probably the most obvious thing me as it set the perfect mood for the it is hard describe in words so just see the and listen it it is wonderfully composed and presented and be sure stick around during the closing credits mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits good use while most comedies use it for outtakes he has included some small scenes help explain the preceding events some may say that these are lame attempts explain the convoluted plot but it is an entertaining way finish the plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits just add the fun wild things is appropriately rated for strong sexuality nudity language and violence again the nudity is rather unnecessary but let us face itpeople want see it so why not give it them neve campbell admirably has nonudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way go neve the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands one almost wonders how they got away the rating the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo your average everyday profanity and cannot stress it enough do not allow kids under see this the target age for the movie is the range and that is who should see it it is definitely not for those under did mention that this is rated however for those that do get chance watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends see it the next time,1.0
the postman delivers but not first class the postman review michael redman copyright michael redman warning my opinion of this is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons postapocalypse stories hope in desperate situation grassroots uprisings and kevin costner even worse thought that waterworld was watchable read the following those particular grains of salt it is the year and things have fallen apart due world war in the late nineties the resulting threeyear winter and devastating plague life in the former united states has been reduced isolated primitive fiefdoms although this is the future it looks like western as the opens kevin costner his characters name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands only his mule bill for company giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in land of outsiders running into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton the ragtag retrofuturistic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan after brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming mile away escapes taking shelter in wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has use for either once he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends be representative from the restored congress of the united states of america this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby olivia williams who wants him father child because her husband is sterile shortly her husband is killed bethlehem and she and the postman as costner is referred for the rest of the become reluctant item although the postman knows he is running fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his secondincommand and they form new pony express dedicated getting the mail through the revived postal service doubles as an army fight the holnists tyranny the postman has become symbol for hope in rube goldberg manner although the movie appeals my sensibilities there are so many things wrong it that they can hardly be counted it is derivitive of costners own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns there is little here that we have not seen dozens of times before the is often downright corny scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs letter from the hands of brighteyed child is embarrassing in its slowmotion banality the films final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor despite the films excessive three hour length several things are never explained what was the war about how did civilization change so rapidly everyone has horses where did all they come from the law of eights that bethlehem lives seems have its origins somewhere beyond the but where are we believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and has not made their way west help or conquer there is some jumbled symbolism here that does not appear make sense the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities the evil army is called holnists sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why is it another coincidence that it takes place in just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict new world for mankind why is the general named bethlehem there seems be some reason for that but what sometimes the movie feels like joke an army of postal workers armed guns considering the headlines of recent years it takes tremendous leap of faith cheer for these guys it is even more difficult accept those repowering the federal government as the heroes given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government it is asking lot for the audience get behind the films nationalism even its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that have it is doubtful that the postman is going find much of an audience but few of us are going have good time besides we are all awaiting the fall of civilization caused the year millennium computer bug michael redman has written this column for over years and would like announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is the best of his knowledge not him perhaps this similarlynamed person should have used kevin costners postal service,1.0
there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not take advantage of this for some personal reason good will hunting is about one of those people the will hunting of the horrible title let us face it this would be bitch title played cowriter matt damon is mathematical genius he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes brew cup of irish cream cappuccino and he works at mit as the janitor one day the professor of one of the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves stellan skarsg rd puts big problem on the board for his students attempt complete the next day it is already done on the board but no one in his class claims have done it so lambeau puts another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years prove and duh it is done again of course they catch the guy who did it red handed will before lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will has gotten into fight bunch of punks on basketball court and struck police officer so lambeau gets him out on probation two agreements he work him on math and he get some therapy after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another for hypnotist he fakes being under his spell then launches into an impromptu performance of the classic afternoon delight finally lambeaus old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams psych professor agrees treat him and the two begin rocky relationship as sean tries get will open up turns out will had rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster homes and what not it also turns out that will does not want do simple mathematics all his life he wants challenge and that is hang out his buds including the other cowriter ben affleck and do honorable jobs like construction is it right make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky should this guy be forced do something he does not want do this appears be one of the million questions in this is jampacked greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should am not saying good will hunting is bad at all it is very enjoyable tons of great moments and lots of great things about it the acting is amazing two oscarnominationworthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together we also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays wills love interest skylar there are tons of individual moments that adored loved all the comedy in the especially scene where damon proves schmuck out of college student who is quoting historian impress some chicks his various attempts at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire the one where he delivers long exstensive rant some nsa agents about the downside of working for them liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends there are scenes between them are just amazing watch and there are even moments in the are so honest in their portrayal that felt rightfully uncomfortable like the breakup scene between will and skylar will and seans first meeting bar scene between sean and lambeau and scene where sean tells in detail how he does not regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter however the main flaw of the is there is too much of everything and not enough of it either the tries for deeper relations between the characters but they are sometimes either overwritten or underwritten take for example the relationship between sean and will the gets an interesting fatherson as well as doctorpatient relationship going out any problems but when it tries show them as equals it falls on its face we hear how they went the same town and there are even scenes where the shows how hypocritical both of them are at times but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do also wills relationship his best friend chuckie affleck has nice climax but not enough rising action we see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at decision between the two of them it seems more like superficial reasoning than more selected one their relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems be generalization of any two best friends instead of something more human maybe it was just me and it also goes for parallelism the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten and of course as in most films like this the girlboy relationship is pretty underwritten we never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she loves him it seems more like it is there for plot details that anything else minnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character the writing is bit at fault here but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the where it acheives true awesomeness sure it feels overstuffed but it is extremely enjoyable the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human think that they should get nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue is amazing while this is probably director gus van sants most conservative you would hardly know it is the same director of die for the only van sant have seen really it is still pretty remarkable albeit tad overrated what is this best picture deal and if puts smile on my face despite posessing lot of flaws have no problem reccomending it anyone,1.0
i guess it is credit jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour could not be ruined even the nauseating comedy of chris tucker am fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects this time around the evil smugglers are led ricky tan john lone who makes his fortune shipping counterfeit money into the united states am still not sure how you can make fortune doing that is there place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones the only way tell the phony money from the genuine article is set it on fire and see what color it burns of course it is up hong kong detective lee chan and trashtalking lapd detective james carter tucker take the bad guys out and the authorities the extent that they even exist stay out of their way rush hour turns the tables on the first in that here it is carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having get them out guarantee that my rating would have been at least half of grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan he refuses shut up not only did his voice feel like jackhammer on my head but his jokes just are not funny pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny realize that in movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates but did not anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was if this is all the comedian has offer then do not care see any more of his films fortunately chan makes for marvelous straight man and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely it is not often that one actor can so completely save movie but there is no other name for what he does whenever he is on screen rush hour comes nearly breathtaking often hilarious life much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is watch chan try be player but who cares can think of few high concepts that are funnier the movie ends outtakes that as usual show that chan is not perfect and that it does indeed take him few tries get some of his incredible stunts look seamless chris tucker botches some lines as well and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie lot of people have pointed out rush hour is not very different from its predecessor in tone or style but liked the original and like the sequel though certain sidekick seems have done his best ruin it director brett ratner the family man keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit miss ratio of the jokes guess sometimes the shotgun approach works it is not great jackie chan but it is jackie chan and that is enough up next jay and silent bob strike back,1.0
some critics including siskel ebert are on the record stating that martin scorseses raging bull the story of boxer jake la motta is the best of the since there are still number of films that have not seen do not feel qualified make such judgment but will say this without hesitation raging bull is great motion picture and would be surprised if more than handful of films released between january and december come close its level biopics often fall into one of two categories overblown hero worship or dry dull textbook account it is rare that movie the moniker based on the life of comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining raging bull is the perfect counterexample and brilliant argument for makers continue work in this genre the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta middleweight icon from the and and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever reach the big screen for all minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro in the title role have us mesmerized this individual who is turns sympathetic sad and horrifying historically raging bull is said be mostly accurately the lions share of the details culled from la mottas own autobiography was cowritten joseph carter and peter savage however although la motta is credited as the movies consultant he was reportedly unhappy the final result because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth insensitive lout the la motta of the movie is man of extreme appetites who is driven base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage sex and violence are inextricably linked the title is apt la motta is raging bull in the ring he is terror not just beating his opponents but destroying them outside of it he is no less vicious or more easily controlled the two people who spar him on lifes canvas are his wife vicki cathy moriarty and his brothermanager joey joe pesci these are the two who mean the most jake and who as result of his inability trust himself or others he loses he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity and when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him his lets loose an explosion of violence raging bull opens in when la motta an upandcoming fighter is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class over the years he wins several key bouts including one against his archrival sugar ray robinson johnny barnes but his unwillingness capitulate the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity participate in championship match meanwhile away from the ring la motta falls in love year old vicki who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife vicki becomes jakes greatest prize wife in his view is not companion but possession and the source of his most extreme pain his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful him hence he is constantly haunted belief that she is sleeping someone else perhaps even his brother this leads the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you king my wife in the late la motta gets his first shot at championship fight but one huge condition he must take fall he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing two years later he wins the championship only lose it in subsequent bout sugar ray the late and early when the ends jake has become pathetic figure broke overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of minor has lost his wife and children and is trying earn few bucks doing cheap standup routine raging bull is the other side of rocky sylvester stallones tale of boxing triumph was released great critical acclaim in it won the best picture oscar and sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production but where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring while scorseses primary aim is present riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside of sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters throw matches continue working rocky shows boxing at its noblest raging bull shows it at its most diseased there is little can say here that has not already said about de niros performance in career that has included many fine roles this is his most outstanding the level of intensity de niro brings la motta is unwavering and although there is lot of travis bickle de niros character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go great lengths make sure that if we never fully sympathize him at least we understand the forces that drive him this is complete characterization and perfect example of acting as the younger jake de niro is trim and fit as the fat older man de niro gained pounds and turned his body into grotesque parody of its normal form how many actors would go that far the best oscar statue is only one testimony the lasting power of the performance cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work although neither won their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niros pesci who has basically recreated the same personality in two other scorsese films goodfellas and casino presents joey as slightly more intelligent version of his brother the misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed but when joey snaps as he does in one scene where he pounds on mobster frank vincent it is startling behold moriarty on the other hand must play the temptress virginal qualities the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake later she is called upon portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected shoot the bulk of raging bull in blackandwhite few home movie segments are in color the choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull unique look in an era when blackandwhite approach is almost unheard of one important recent exception schindlers list eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did in blackandwhite especially considering scorseses choice of shots and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing there is no room for romanticism in the ring inky black blood staining the canvas during fight sequences the director also uses number of pointofview shots designed show the world however briefly from la mottas perspective scorsese could have chosen end the la mottas loss sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown after that his career was all downhill yet the director allows the run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than decade into la mottas future the reason is obvious scorsese is not as interested in boxing as he is in the character following his retirement la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever but he has lost the arena in he can legally unleash those tendencies we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him parody of his former self who cannot feel surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brandos speech from on the waterfront coulda been contenda perhaps raging bull is indeed the best of the and if not it is certainly perilously close the zenith,1.0
much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in time when one would think that faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it is important address it straightforwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this has been in limbo for number of years lying around in vaults san distributor and having critics waiting either hail it masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit when seeing this after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well you just have wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution what is even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you are familiar anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic this is real pity because when you really sit down watch this ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it it is really quite perhaps the best director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacobs ladder have seen this lolita twice the first time was not so blown away it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting the second time not really thinking about how have waited for what seems like forever see it and how am seeing it on tv set on premium cable channel and not giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally the story itself is surprisingly heartbreaking one is why it is such good novel and why this is such good the story of pedophile obsessed young year old girl named dolores k lolita is great because it is not trash for the perverted but because it is about human obsession things that are out of ones reach its protagonist the comicallynamed humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies the character of lolita is almost symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we cannot live without these ideas are all worked into this nicely but done in way that is not heavyhanded at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating the focus of this and the reason for making it it seems was really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes are blatantly overstylized the tone of the book is comical one but it is also tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective humbert exists in fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire has been designed we get sense that perhaps it is doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original yearold love and allows himself embody her as lolita he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and the end he has nothing but overlydramatic feelings for her the story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of test seeing if the readers will really sympathize someone who is socially deemed pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as means bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them peace the weirdest thing about this is that the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify him the opening and final images of the are the same and who has not done similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but deep sadness in us this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock stanley kubrick who could not possibly have brought the novel the screen as much faithfulness as lyne has been able do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up droll black comedy about obsession in general in that he used the traps of society as benefits the studio demanded the final scene that of heinous murder come first in the so portray humbert first as murderer and second as pedophile and when you see it it gives the depth of man trapped obsession the censors would not allow anymore than couple glances and subtle dialogue show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy seep through looking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we have read novel and see adaptation we are bound be angered any size differences it is really impossible compare them they both go for different things and one has lot more room be as sexually frank as the novel was and although it is true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it is unfair say one is better and one is worse have never been one for saying the level of greatness of adaptation of novel is deemed how faithful it is and will not say that here however this is pretty amazing mostly because hey loved the book and this nearly reminded me of it it does not have nearly as much wit couple comical scenes and even lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had some of that is in the casting of the two leads jeremy irons his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert he is droll in very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does he brings wonderful sympathy the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy identify the audience and when he looks at lolita love and she looks at him lust you know that he is her prisoner for as long as he lives and dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and selfcenteredness that marks the character it is easy see why she surrenders humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way him at any time when he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly scene involving rocking chair and little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert follow her there are two other minor characters in the one who is road block in the beginning and the other who is reappearing threat the relationship the former is charlotte lolitas mother played melanie griffith in the book charlotte is monster of woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overlyreligious and ultimately selfish and she is the one obstacle humbert has overcome obtain his goal at least in the beginning as played shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played griffith here she is about half of them it is annoying watch and play game where you try see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first and even though griffith is not really bad persay she is nothing more the other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying seduce lolita and succeeds but at price langella takes totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original quilty was comic character in the original threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk langella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness be unearthed and the result is character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him as you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of whole new look at the novel at least cinemawise this version is beautiful and perpetually saddening the camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich the acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita more importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it the end humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he does not regret we feel that we all lose something we can never have,1.0
capsule sidesplitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through the end but not without providing good deal of genuine laughs most comedies these days have one flaw they are not funny they think they are funny but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly occasionally good funny movie sneaks past the deadening preconceptions of humor and we get real gem ruthless people for instance established microcosm of setup and played it out the bitter end liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny this is one of the few movies have seen where was laughing consistently almost all the way through instead of couple of setpieces that inspired laugh think of the dismal fatal instinct the whole movie works like clockwork jim carrey playes highpowered lawyer whom lying is as natural as breathing there is one thing he takes seriously though his son and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away but his wife is divorced and seeing another man and now it looks like they may move away together the son goes them of course the movie sets up this early material good timing and remarkable balance of jim carreys overthetop persona reality then the plot springs into action after being snubbed not deliberately his father at his birthday the kid makes wish as he blows out the birthday candles that for just one day dad cannot lie he gets the wish what happens next is sidesplitting everything turns into confrontation when cornered bum for some change he shouts no am not giving you any money because know you will spend it on booze all want do is get the office without having step over the debris of our decaying society he cannot even get into an elevator without earning black eye and what is worse he is now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture carrey who used find unfunny has gotten better at his schtick even if it is limited one he uses it great effect in this movie there is scene where he tries test his ability lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process there is grin breaking out across my face right now just remembering the scene he cannot even write the lie his fingers twitch his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning and when he tries talk it is like he is speaking in tongues equally funny is scene where he beats himself pulp do not ask why tries drink water keep from having outbursts in the courtroom it fails semipredictable results and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom have everyone ask what they think of them this scene alone may force people stop the tape for minutes on end the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end shame too because the movie insists on having big ridiculous climax that involves carreys character flagging down plane using set of motorized stairs then breaking his leg etc simple reconciliation would do the trick why is this stupid pentup climax always obligatory it is not even part of the movies real agenda thankfully liar liar survives it and so does carrey maybe they were being merciful on reflection if would laughed any more might have needed an iron lung,1.0
maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it is not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month because it very well could have been manipulative tearjerker broadcasted on abc on monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively because it is not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it is so great underneath the todiefor cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction is of modesty not sure whether or not this story is totally great but the balls run it tell it in certain original way it does not merely go from plot point plot point it goes from character character it obsesses itself the depth and the style of it all and makes the story of worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters both musicians who have totally unique relationship it is that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this transcend any cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional and real in short this movie is just awesome it merely tells its story really well and that is something that just has be commended these days when most stories are botched because they are not told great storytellers director anand tucker tells this story well he overdramaticizes everything but still keeps it real the tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr rachel griffiths and emily watson respectively two sisters who are first seen in childhood played auriol evans and keely flanders respectively as the very best of friends they are also both musicians hilary flutist and jackie cellist and when it all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary is seen as the better of the two jackie bit jealous works and works at her playing skills and soon the tables are turned when they both hit adulthood hilary strives for comeback while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world but instead of fame captures the heart of hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey in semistarmaking turn they marry after short courtship and move lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes symbol of her current life when she plays she has the eyes of the world but when she stops she is alone she enters into shallow relationship an equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain in hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins lose it and runs away hilarys country home where she hopes gain admittance hilary sleep her husband since no one she sleeps gives her any pleasure it is all terribly melodramtic as you can see and the time jackie has contracted ms in brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar shine in technical and emotional devastation it would have been the time that could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it had not been handled in such way the key thing here is that it is not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it is about her tumultuous relationship her sister might add is perfectly realized their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world but they are also completely jealous of one another when young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries in vain make comeback but cannot and almost seems marry get back at jackie for her success when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry wonderful man she is jealous of her lifestyle the most extensive brinks that have ever seen in only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man and the whole time their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested another thing really liked is emily watsons performance usually make it note never overpraise an actor for playing either drunkard or lunatic or someone mortal disease or any combination of the three my reasoning for this is that it is fucking easy job the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in beloved sure she is good but what is so tough about playing woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like three year old inside year olds body hell could play that if had pair of breasts in that same exact movie though is performance kimberly elise where she has be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never be seen again and her mothers lover is scared off she has actually deal real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons if you do not believe me look at jack nicholsons performance in as good as it gets great performance but easy job this is not so for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just plot point and thanks the opening sequence where we see her and hilary as kids we understand the motives behind all her actions and the time she actually contracts ms and begins loose her sanity and her life we have already understood that this is the last straw for woman plagued terrible neuroses rachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy watsons protagonist actually matches watson stepforstep because as watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has deal what she is able give her sister who needs emotional help from her griffiths an otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer is absolutely brilliant just as absolutely brilliant as watson is and if the academy and all the other critics groups who have already deemed watsons performance the best of the year glance over hers because she is the one who does not get go insane read she gets the boring role then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me after all griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real the tom cruise role in rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman she does and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year it is griffiths together the two actresses work extremely well though and both have go through deep emotional hell the likes of have not been seen this year if it had not been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much jackie and not enough hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety would say this is one of the top ten best films of the year it is so close perfection in its structure its treatment of its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without shred of doubt in my mind and maybe editing that it is nearly shame that it is not the flawless gem that it should be but hey as it is can hardly complain,1.0
as write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy you have got mail am acutely aware that am typing it on computer and sending it billion miles away on the internet am also aware that have just spent the last hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online and wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as can watch tom hanks and meg ryan think will be okay paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia like him best when he is suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in romantic comedy when he is going get the girl the only question is how meg ryan americas high school sweetheart can act she is had handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally must not mention what she does due the well um you get the idea and if you do not get the movie fantastic but like her best when she is well perky she is so adorably perkycute that together hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back really old classic romantic couples but do not really know all know is that just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that is really hard resist and am not going even try they are just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is little different kathleen kelly ryan owns small childrens bookstore her mother founded years ago and passed down her she is successful beautiful and dates wellknown columnist very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny they have strictly undetailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny happens be joe fox hanks multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores run his father coleman fox books has decided open store on the west side right across from little childrens bookseller named shop around the corner run perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight the death it is charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in the romance she wants have it also has the great sense of being classic romance there is no let us have sex tonight mantra if you will excuse my bluntness this is solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know it is going happen the question is now thankfully ephron has wonderful supporting cast posey kinnear chappelle and host of others including great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids it is all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is believe americas greatest actor does he show it here nah but he is still tom hanks and she is still meg ryan is what this movie boils down it is pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script it is all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really does not work as well as would have liked and for romantic comedy it is slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow even looked at my watch couple times make sure ephron was going deliver the big onscreen kiss was waiting for so that could get home at reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up be really dated email when my kids are my age do not know what we will be using but hanks can do more one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves dive into pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and it is nice see it gives you well smile the script helps some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time keep the audience awake was arguing my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was have always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs survive the ability think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well would rather not think about that always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for night and was thinking about how incredible year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world he is also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie it is sweet lovely affair technology twist it may be long commercial but it gave me pretty big smile on my face,1.0
are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny directorwriter brad anderson seems be saying yes both questions in his witty next stop wonderland the two main characters alan and erin spend the entire movie in each others orbit catching glimpses of one another yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together does this predestination carry over all aspects of life as the starts erin castleton hope davis melancholy year old late shift nurse is ending her livein relationship her boyfriend hoffman rather he is ending it her arriving home from work erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment car packed his belongings in fumbling amusing and self deluding ramble he instructs erin watch videotape he is made detailing why their relationship is doomed fail and why he is leaving it is obvious he lacks the courage confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something his life and taking stand all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship he then flees the scene the grace of an inept thief erins mother holland taylor in surprisingly effective small role fearing that her daughter will be without man in her life takes out personal ad for erin erins embarrassed horror the ad describes her as frisky cultured carefree professional zest for life eventually erin responds the tidal wave of responses makes for some of the most humorous telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and poseurs alan plumber and aspiring marine biologist first spots erin as he is cleaning the inside glass of fish tank at the boston aquarium wearing wet suit and goggles he follows erin from window window separated the glass as erin oblivious his gaze enjoys the fish later we see him on train as she sits on platform outside mere feet away the movie spends it is entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing there are several subplots involving alan one concerns his attempts get on the job track at the boston aquarium thereby escaping his apparent fate carry on the family plumbing business another subplot involves his fathers desperate attempts force fates hand gambling away his life at the dog track distracting focus is put on alans debt loan shark and the manner in he pays it off the movie tries too hard make alan likable guy thankfully his dream guy persona is counterbalanced erins distant yet fundamentally hopeful personality the moves along at an unhurried pace albeit too much so in the latter third as we wait for the two meet cowriters anderson and lyn vaus throw couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships the films shifts into much slower gear as we wait for these romances blow over when alan and erin eventually do meet we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share lingering almost subliminally knowing gaze it is sweet measured moment the disappointment comes in the fact that we have come know the pair yet we do not get view their impending romance the films inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring ones life makes next stop wonderland quiet pleasure in cinematic landscape littered explosions shallow characters and overdone special effects,1.0
i am an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously tad biased at least admitted it of course that does not mean that am gonna be giving this fourstar review or something because alien resurrection the fourth in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing much like the first two were however it is very good never fails entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series in short had good time alien resurrection leaves off years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genres answer job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting pop out like it did john hurt in the first one of course the last one was not very great or anything liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it was not financially successful tawdry million bucks so back we are ripley back as clone means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that is bad thing but it is becoming cliche so she is cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called the auriga some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played e freeman as well as the littleseen dr gediman played none other than brad douriff mainly because they have version of her the alien still inside her once you get past the fact that you cannot figure out where they got her blood although think it might have been from the blood samples taken charles dance in the third one the films okay also on board are band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out have bit of secret will not state it but unless you have been shacking up salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although it is nicely covered up there is bit of nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it is never really deepened enough oh well well as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship and it pretty much does away most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who is death is comical yet sad since well he is dan hedaya and the remaining people about or are left try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth of course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun the real focus of the series seems be on style not really substance although there is always bit of it most notably in aliens the relationship between ripley and the little girl what is interesting about the series is that each is stylistically different in its approach alien is claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights aliens is wild tense thriller alien is bleak moody piece of seminoir alien is kind of like an offbeat french filled lots of humor and cool scares jeanpierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates ship filled the kind of scares films like das boot has echoes hinting at possible threat the chills in the are really cool especially the music is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there is the most tense surgery scene since faceoff towards the beginning and not every chill turns into bloody mess or anything like that this all combined some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others there are even couple scenes just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed one is the aforementioned surgery scene another one takes place between call and ripley is just awesome the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga small allusion jeunets earlier delicatessen and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool lovely allusion goldfinger but the best scene in the entire am sure am not the first mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has an tatooed on her arm it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga the screenplay joss whedon is not great piece of work as it never really deapens lot of the characters however it does make us care about most of them so that when there is very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do have fuck get off this boat johner well can get you off but not this ship the acting is good all around standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in seen who performed the lust sin as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him winona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well the of course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show playing variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable she is not going get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she is just awesome overall it is thrilling entertaining does not really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment the style is the best part of the is not really bad thing but it being the best part takes away from lot of the depth the occasionally tries apply but it is entertaining as hell and it is definitely fit for the alien series,1.0
it may seem weird begin about glam rock sequence that includes spaceship green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wilde but if one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off wildes philosophy was that everyone should be true their own human nature and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned loosing his family and his career the glam rock movement in the early in england had similar take and came similar demise the main difference was placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else and that is why the movement seemed end as soon as it began it is been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the that chronicles what it was like be part of the movement not only from those who experienced it but those who created it steals lot from citizen kane and that is true in the british journalist in the arthur stuart christian bale is asked go back and find out what happened glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star who faked his own death on stage bringing the end not only his career but the entire glam rock movement structurewise this totally steals from kane not only from the setup he interviews three people and the story is result of their flashbacks but in other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter exfriend in wheelchair and the bitter exwife as washedup lounge singer found in bar after hours this is no kane and it really does not aspire be it does not attempt be the deep outlook of something gone like kane did and it does not really uncover anything poignant about humanity instead it uses the flashbacks as form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants the scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped performance bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging but the scenes are engaging though not mention addictively campy they radiate gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era and feel that is so eerily lighthearted that when combined the thenfootage they become not only symbol of decadence but of times when everything seemed so simple instead of creating the world the way it was haynes paints their own world as if it were narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you have experienced it everything else seems so mundane there is no outside world speak of secluding these people inside protective globe that will eventually crack haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed it as merely that contributors blade played reserve the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played anarchic wildness ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete the creation of ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music but also partners in bed through discussions slades exmanager cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes british accent when slade and finally expartner wild journalist stuart begins remember his own experiences in the era like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality when he opens up his first slade record he finds naked and green slade lying on crimson blanket and finally running away from home be part of the london scene finally resulting in leading boring job in america haynes demonstrates that he is quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such as seemingly long sequence juxtaposing sladewild concert of them performing brian eno cover babys on fire scenes from decadent drug party and the films most wowinspiring sequence the first concert scene of wild his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggyesuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the captures that perfect moment when one discovers major talent and another slade discovers his idle even the brief music videos spoofs of bowies have rare visual flair that is pure camp and would cause ken russell drool the best sequence though may be the beginning following the prelude sequence acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the postmovement era in it stuart and his mates are going the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears be real assasination brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet brian enos famous needle in the camels eye playing in the background the scene has detached exhileration the song does not seem be played in quite the same way the other songs are it has distance that is hard put finger on and it seems represent that all this is coming quick and sad ending and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show docked in silver frock wings and blue hair depressingly staring into the mirror it comes off as nonetooobvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the this movies not so much about plot but more about the way it is presented making this one of those films is classified as being style over substance statement prompts many critics line up for attack however for the most part the engaging part of this is not the story but rather the way in haynes creates this world using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music play as characters in his the music is especially notable the soundtrack is wall wall consists of old school glam rock tunes the likes of brian eno trex and roxy music as well as covers slades band vocals thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music shudder think that sounds uncannily bowielike the cast is rather impressive but no one really walks away the and no performances are extremely good although eddie izzard as slades manager who challenges slades first manager an armwrestling match see who gets control of his career and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably subpar neither putting lot of effort into their respective roles some of it is at fault the actual construction of the haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor for the glam rock era dying when he turned into retrogarbo resorting life of salingerism and found in the mids be lying around sniffing coke off the ass of party girl in fact no one in this is really seen as person rather than just as symbol or composite of type who thrived during the era bales character is an especially tough sell bitter and depressed flashbacks his young adulthood he is not an extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded the record store guys for buying record put out poof never help us communicate him nevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them and others bitter part of helps the work since this is major piece of eye candy at the prime of the movie they at least look the role of fashionable leaders slade his perpetuallychanging androgonys persona and wild his topless and unpredictable image clash and fuse into an unstable union their story of how slade was so influenced wild that he adapted it into similar whocares attitude crossed camp is engaging without the personal background the story of stuart though is tougher sell because he is the everyman and when you cannot totally identify the everyman your storys in slight trouble as cultural rock piece velvet goldmine is rather good but it is merely good it never totally takes off although it has moments where it absolutely flies but then comes back down it is really nothing more than bunch of really great moments surrounded material that could really be much better the beginning is captivating but slow the middle is fantastic and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that it drags the final half hour not only does it not bring the story any real conclusion it could probably stop at any point and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than unearth the past is commendable but not totally so still it does what the oliver stone pic the doors did not do right becoming very insightful what happened using the visual style hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems halfassed suppose the message is live life but after you have lived it what else is the point when you will be forced live regretful memories the really superb achievement of this is that during its flashbacks it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like be in that era but the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes

first am not big fan of the xfiles tv series have nothing against it particularly just do not happen watch it having said that can now say that liked the xfiles pretty well for us nonfans there is nothing big going for it but there are lot of little things the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in c two protohumans enter the cave and find space alien cocooned inside the alien breaks free and kills one man in struggle while the other is seemingly captured the bloody ooze from the alien the movie jumps the same cave today where boy lucas black from sling blade is captured the same black ooze we then cut fbi agents scully and mulder gillian anderson and david duchovny who have been pulled off of their previous assignment investigations into the paranormal and put onto the bomb squad detail caller has threatened federal building in dallas texas on hunch mulder checks out the building across the street and would not you know it he turns out be right the fbi finds the bomb in time evacuate but not in time defuse five people die in the blast and when mulder learns who the victims were light bulb goes on over his head the two agents team up investigate against fbi orders the links mulder has made their search leads them back the north texas cave all across the country and even antarctica as they get closer and closer the truth the plot and the truth are uninspired got the feeling that what learned was supposed shock and amaze me it did not the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them but the point of the xfiles is not what the truth is but the extent it has been hidden it is slightly more interesting angle but it still raises expectations about that truth too high if this were the whole would say the movie was mediocre perhaps even boring but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough recommend it the pacing of the was brisk enough hold my interest before the audience can get tired of one location the agents follow hot tip another location and so on and so forth the locations are not all computergenerated sets either there are some artificial settings but the desert night of nevada the edge of suburbia in texas and the endless fields of snow in antarctica actually somewhere in north america make this fantastic feel more real ward russells cinematography is very good the overall look is dark and ominous appropriate the intended tone of the films plot russell is able make something as innocuous as cornfield look foreboding when the movie is set in darkness the picture quality is still rich and detailed finally and specifically there is an incredible shot at night in the camera crosses the tracks in front of fast oncoming train do not know if the shot is faked in any way but it looks dangerous and it looks great the movies soundtrack is also used convey the dark tone of the skip the next paragraph if you have yet see the movie there is spoiler in the following sentences during the opening prehistoric sequence howling wind dogs the soundtrack never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound in one of the movies most effective sequences metallic doors suddenly slam open release cloud of buzzing bees the visuals of the scene are good but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound there was no question as who the movies stars would be even so duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and good combination both are easy on the eyes and together they have some good timing banter and energy there is hint of chemistry between them but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship they are like couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street there might be some romantic interest but for now they are more interested in their environs than they are in each other no single element really makes this movie outstanding not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular but enough things were done right that the xfiles is one of the more interesting summer adventures come along,1.0
many people will not find much like in what dreams may come the new visionary director vincent ward most will come see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors but little do they know as so plainly found out that this has quite complex story tell walking out of the theater could see the audiences disgust one member even had be awakened after the ended do not believe the previews that you see this is definitely not for everyone this is quite possibly one of the most adultoriented films come out in recent years kids will get bored the slow plotting and the complex storyline the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents us it goes back and forth in time as if it has no boundaries think of the city of angels now add more complex screenplay and more unique vision both films deal the afterlife but doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office costing around million make the would have do extremely well in order make it is money back but due it is story doubt it will for everyone who thought titanics story was too simple and cliche here is proof that if james cameron had written more complex screenplay it may not have done nearly as well but do not get me wrong hope the does do well it is vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put the screen doubt most of us could have thought of this place even in our own mind what dreams may come is the second best of the year when it comes visuals the only that surpasses it is dark city full of rich shocking colors we get see heaven that most of us would probably die get but do not do that because you will end up going hell what dreams may come begins two boats colliding on lake chris christy nielsen robin williams is startled the sudden jolt but is even more startled the beauty of the woman in the other boat annie annabella sciorra spies chris as well and both eventually bond and get married annie is an artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic chris is doctor and loves annie more than life itself they also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock but one day the two children are killed in car crash and it almost destroys annie she tries commit suicide but fails and is then put in an institution chris copes the problem realizing they are not around anymore and nothing will change that just as annie gets her life back in order chris is killed while trying save the life of car crash victim chris goes heaven or his version of heaven rather guided albert cuba gooding jr chris explores his new surroundings pure delight and joy that is until he realizes how miserable he is without annie prior heaven he would try comfort annie but the more he was around the more pain she felt chris decides leave her alone little does he realize what will happen next am not about say because the plot point is crucial the rest of the story many critics however give it away certainly chris dying is crucial the plot but they tell you that he dies in the previews story is not necessarily important for this movie work because it deals the afterlife however strangely virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil couple of comments here and there but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life we are soul mates chris exclaims heaven in movies is almost always depicted as glowing city of white purity and love usually it also looks like it rests among the clouds but what dreams may come goes different route it shows us heaven that most of us have never seen before chris heaven is his memories brought life his thoughts can make anything real and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven have never seen anyone use real paint before albert says equally good as the depictions of hell cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone instead it is state of being in one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive at sea of faces thousands of heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else mostly dead silent some quips are made almost as if lighten the mood it is truly frightening sequence production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going be up for an oscar nomination using state of the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration sometimes some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact it is not necessary be there but we appreciate seeing it costume designer yvonne blake who also appears in the has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes cinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove has difficult job as most cinematographers do working special effects but serras entire universe is computer generated image and he does masterful job writer ron bass adapting from the novel richard matheson provides very fluid screenplay no real set plot the story is extremely vague in its details allowing viewers think for themselves about the meaning and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision what dreams may come is good example of german expressionism may just turn off good portion of the audience your average movie goer more than likely is not used expressionistic techniques the will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they should not take it too far it is after all just movie robin williams has continuously impressed his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff but when is confined screenplay he is not quite as effective but drama is really his strong point and you can see that here it is doubtful he will get another oscar nomination but would not really mind if he did the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year cop land this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention it is also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination however the academy does not like award performances for these types of films cuba gooding jr has been better but he is certainly not distracting max von sydow is underused as are jessica brooks and josh paddock treat for some movie goers is see werner herzog appear if they even recognize him as chris father lost in the sea of faces it is not hard see why herzog would be attracted this considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images overall it is williams and sciorras what dreams may come is rated pg for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity the is definitely aimed at more adult audience some will find the plot distracting some will find the visuals absolutely glorious and some will find both the only real problem the that could see was that it slows down considerably during the midsection just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins the way some controversy even surrounded the title was mistaken for sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand in actuality the title is from soliloquy in hamlet just thought should let you know,1.0
when was growing up in boys in my school used divide into two groups based on their action movies preferences the first one myself included liked movies that featured spectacular car chases lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks probably because they could or be more precise thought they could imitate its stunts in the real life decades later while refining my own cinematic taste began appreciate and actually like those movies probably because of overexposure shootemup idiocy of ramboids yes most of the kung fu and other martial arts flicks were cheap they had predictable and formulaic plot and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills but in the same time those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation the best of those movies one that passed the test of time and managed keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon made in in joint hong kong venture it was intended bring bruce lees skills and kung fu philosophy the western audience it succeeded but it is still debatable whether its own merit or the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor lee plays quiet shaolin monk who is martial arts expert he is approached interpol official who asks him join triannual martial arts tournament that is held on remote island owned and controlled han renegade shaolin monk interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics gunrunning and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities intervene lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons oharra hans brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lees sister years ago the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us williams played jim kelly is black activist running from the racist police and his friend roper wants make money in order pay gambling debts the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced james bond the franchise itself would return favour using kung fu elements in the man the golden gun two years later the main hero was faced against powerhungry megalomaniac on remote island alone against whole army of bad guys on the other hand lee was more believable hero than bond deprived of guns and supertech gadgets he had rely only on his personal skills in order survive in the same time the plot although extremely thin allowed him even some internal battles between the natural instinct avenge his sister and his own antiviolent philosophy the latter provided some opportunities evaluate lees acting skills and some new elements his impressive screen presence although two other main actors john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy were intended share top spot lee they served as nothing more than comic relief it is real shame see kelly definitely the worse actor than saxon steal the scenes from him only because his lines being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches sound so damn over the top other actors not including shih kien who turns han into typical although not very convincing bondian villain are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee among them is young jackie chan fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were years ago although they mostly lack gore associated that genre in many way they are also more realistic they were personally staged lee himself demanding only blow or two incapacitate or kill the opponent am not martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan but comparing those scenes typical scenes today simply cannot avoid appreciate the difference from todays movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage get up from the floor and win in the end so despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top of all times enter the dragon is incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even those who do not like that particular genre,1.0

nosferatu the vampyre germany review mike watson copyright mike watson this extraordinary retelling of bram stokers dracula german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore inspired w murnaus silent of the same name herzogs is work of exquisite bleakness an oddly touching tragedy beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards the original fulllength english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received video release s distributor anchor bay entertainment and in gorgeous widescreen prints until now only shortened english language version of the was available on video and only in europe both of these rereleases restore the its full length but viewers should still be wary of the english version due its often stilted dialogue apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent and some of the voices also seem be dubbed the german version english subtitles remains the definitive one everyone knows the story of dracula or do they his story has been so bastardised on over the years that brief reminder of the basic plot certainly will not hurt jonathan harker is young lawyer sent the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania do business creepy count played klaus kinski who wants buy house in harkers hometown upon seeing photo of harkers wife the radiant isabelle adjani he instantly falls in love her locking harker up in his castle he sets off on long journey meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him upon divining his identity as vampire adjani seduces the count and lures him his death one morning as the sun rises that is story familiar millions but herzog has elevated stokers tale into the realm of and use this term tad reluctantly cinematic art nosferatu is as much meditation as it is shot through blueish and white filters and peopled characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised the films surreal dreamlike quality is utterly mesmerising there is much enjoy but will limit my praise few key points holding the together is kinskis remarkable performance as count dracula past screen portrayals including bela lugosis famous turn have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp but kinski oh boy this is something far more compelling aided startling makeup job he portrays draculas vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease this man is dreadfully lonely he lives in utter solitude shunned the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust kinskis portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting when he dies you almost feel as if this mans tortured soul has been freed at last then there is the unforgettable soundtrack largely composed german group popul vuh it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it is quite impossible imagine the without it popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancientsounding kind of spacemusic using piano chants and exotic instruments when first saw this some years ago was so impressed tracked down and bought number of their albums the one still listen the most is tantric songs from most of the music in nosferatu is taken it is testament the musics depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is them the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies this is timely rerelease anchor bay after francis ford coppolas unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stokers tale in it is joy go back herzogs and see the amazing things he has done what is now centuryold story some aficionados nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire ever made without doubt it is an unmistakable classic of the genre do not miss it,1.0
even if did not know that director and cowriters james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the xfiles would have inevitably made connection the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot the mysterious characters the overall dark ominous settings it would have been perfectly fitting see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case they witness stuff like this on weekly basis in fact mulder and scully would have been much more welcome change the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie another more important similarity is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time this is great accomplishment for teen horror movie especially when compared some of the trash of the same genre released in the last couple of years urban legend and still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch what helps final destination is its unique premise unlike your average horror flick in some invincible psycho knife chases blonde cheerleaders the villain presented is unusual it is the grim reaper this being already has predestined when and how you will die according the brief history lesson given in this everyone was meant die at certain time some people at others at whatever death chooses what is unique about death is that it is already dead so you cannot really kill it the only way defeat death is cheat it the question is how do you do that this dilemma is what faces alex and group of teenagers alex has been having some dreams that the airplane will take his class on trip paris will crash leaving no survivors alex begins realize that his dreams are little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off shortly after the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal however death is not through them yet it gradually kills off the seven one one leaving those currently still alive frantically trying trick death again the plot allows for some of the most creative original death scenes have seen in while some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films sure it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ali larters character is particularly annoying but the shocks from the beginning the end are extremely entertaining also director wong has the sense not take the movie too seriously he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that will not win any academy awards not even golden globe the myriad of inside jokes and gags the characters are named after famous horror directors one character who plays jerk is named carter like xfiles creator chris carter and song john denver who died in plane crash plays whenever death is near show this movie is bunch of guys having good time making movie and from this had great time watching the movie,1.0
take number fill out form and wait your turn starring kati outinen kari n nen sakari kuosmanen elina salo written directed aki kaurism ki cinematography timo salminen it might be possible call drifting clouds satire or black comedy but that would imply sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone it is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward he loses his job as tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays within couple of months she loses her position as head waiter when her restaurant is bought out chain and the entire staff replaced conversation early in the reveals lot about their situation lauri has surprised ilona buying her tv she greets little enthusiasm she notes that they have not finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves it would pass as deadpan humour if it was not spoken such resigned weariness this sets the tone for the rest of the movie there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely their earning capacity there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed the personal the movie is about two people and what happens them and nothing else matters lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion they go the movies and walk out past old posters for latalante and largent but the movie they have just seen is pointless violent unfunny comedy their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes the background colour andor lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound something more complex and desperate than love their downward downsized downtrodden lives have momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of roulette wheel it must have been tempting play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the films great strength is the sober empathic manner in it observes lauri and ilonas misfortunes irony would be an injustice situations and settings are broad and exaggeratedthis is not realismbut they are not distorted the emotions are authentic if it is difficult laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour that is because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding the manifold indignities that are suffered he shows us how humiliating it must be for woman of thirtyeight who has worked long and hard win respectable position be forced accept job as dishwasher in twobit restaurant how humiliating it must be for man nearing confront his wifes former employer demanding the rest of her wages only have the crap beaten out of him unable land single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse give him the money all this is observed keenly great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious if most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of short story bear but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined the sense that the material barely accommodates the minute running length have seen many movies far less profound less humane less necessary than drifting clouds but they filled me an urge watch them again and this one did not it does not need be seen twice its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing it is not movie that will be seen large audience because it cannot be pitched one there is no selling point it is all understatement restraint melancholy the characters are unremarkable their best years behind them their dreams dissipated it takes all the effort they can muster just pay the bills this does not make them less fascinating merely less marketable is shame because this is movie should be seen precisely because it pays attention people and emotions that most movies prefer ignore it engages us and touches us and resolvessurprisingly and movinglyinto something resembling happy ending the only thing greater than the illluck that governs the characters lives is their refusal give in despair their persistence is rewarded what might be called feelgood ending elsewhere but not here because this ending differs in kind from most such endings this one has truly been earned,1.0

seen december at m at the crossgates mall cinema guilderland ny theater matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using prepaid passes if there is ever been an exception the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it and if there is ever been james bond that not only proves this but does so pushing it the extreme tomorrow never dies is it opening sequences almost always make or break action films when done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things come this starts off on the right foot establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but sense of the selfaware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in first there is hightech slightly complicated scene involving british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters there is definite tension as there seems be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides when the scene ends in tragedy it is clear there is some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else call on for such case but james bond the uses good judgment in the way it introduces us bond brosnon as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an outandout hero he singlehandedly takes out small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time flying away in fighter jet while the copilot tries strangle him and terrorist in another jet tries shoot him down this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the knows how get our attention quickly it is not about the payoff because it is obvious bond will escape instead it is the way it processes the action sequences going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe what the deserves kudos for is its ability create villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible jonathon pryce delivers perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver media mogul whose goal is take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons through some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as way create and accurately cover his own news not only is that an original idea for conflict but one could carry over into reality surprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot become the films hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out investigate carver and finds himself in jam or two along the way the story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot somehow chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond few too many times and they find themselves working together the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the manages balance the stunts and special effects its clever story although tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive in terms of its ability be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue,1.0
james jones one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century has written number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual veteran of world war ii and witness the pearl harbor bombings his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence trait lends itself razorsharp focus but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel the thin red line now cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick the books principal cast some thirty characters has been trimmed down for this rendition but it still retains its most endearing value each of the roles has an everyman quality emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier there is definitive chain of command present and this also plays on the motivations of the cast but most importantly and perhaps intrinsic the novel but not the movie dynamic and effective voiceover is used malick has several characters relating their thoughts giving the viewer greater perspective of the issues at stake the issues at stake are many and one told from limited thirdperson perspective as opposed topdown omniscient view the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company cforcharlie take hill during the conflict at guadalcanal the south pacific island is seen the top brass as the key position for american armed forces hold if they want win the war and want win the war they do in an excellent performance nick nolte plays cforcharlies commanding officer lt col gordon tall he is an aging soldier who embodies the winatallcosts mentality if only impress his superior john travolta in questionable cameo this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros elias koteas who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command at the front are the privates and corporals adrien brody james caviezel ben chaplin et al lead st sgt welsh sean penn who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down them the thin red line is filled intense visual poetry but it is nearly three hours long although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours the climax comes fortyfive minutes before the end of the movie it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end the thin red line will doubtless be compared other masterpiece of war saving private ryan countless number of times but do so is belittle both films for although similarities abound so do differences director malick has story tell and for those interested in listening this can be very outstanding movie,1.0
an energetic visually stunning but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne darc in history jeanne darc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors who can basically alter the story as they wish she came in time where people desperately needed saint hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness directorwriter luc besson nikita leon portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft besson tries recreate the person behind the legend he tries not show her as saint or villain he shows her as human being in time where blood was almost pouring from the sky and the air smelled of rotten flesh it is hard keep your sanity the only support and hope is in god at the age of jeanne milla jovovich watches her own sister murdered and raped the english soldiers this terrible event makes lasting impact on jeannes mind god is no longer her support he has become her obsession she starts seeing visions and signs that command her raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny the help of the wise yolande daragon faye dunaway and charles vii john malcovich whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls after this the stays mostly on the battlefield where besson demonstrates his ability direct amazing action sequences only occasionally resorting calmer tempo the movie is filled dreamy symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship that create surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere the is lost in time and space hysterically jumping back and forth in jeannes thoughts imagination and conscience bessons visual style permits the audience enter the medieval age feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle but the is far from being flawless the script needs lot of polishing except for jeanne there are no real characters and although grand star cast is assembled their characters are nothing more than props not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing as for the maiden of lorraine herself she is portrayed as simple girl too small for her divine task in the latter part of the we see her as hysterical confused and on the brink of madness her past purity and innocence for ever lost jovovich handles the part more panache than one might expect but though her screen time is incredible excessive both malcovich being john malcovich and dunaway titus surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance and even hoffman manages breathe some life into his dreadfully small part besides casting jovovich bessons only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder pillage and betray smile on their faces and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen represented the three musketeers of this story the brave gilles de rais vincent cassel the wise aulon desmond harrington and the strong la hire richard ridings though all those actor perform well their characters are nothing more than symbols banners that proclaim the glory of france and thus there is no sense of realism in this the messenger has muscles instead of brains there is some relief in the end where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking dustin hoffmans appearance helps and the ends elegantly and surprisingly effective climax worthy of praise jeannes character is unlocked but whether god was in the picture or not is never quite explained was she confused peasant girl driven her own hunger for revenge or was she truly messenger of god the poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious bess messenger is nothing more than fairly good it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater maybe the sound the dreamy sequences but certainly not the dialogue it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtvgeneration that although presents some interesting material works better when it is on the battlefield,1.0
i am not quite sure what say about mars attacks is obviously the work of deranged genius when tim burtons twisted alien invasion comedy really works it is breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure and when it does not work it is just dull am not even sure it works more often than it does not but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down the business of blasting us kingdom come mars attacks is brilliant mars attacks is based on rather unsavory series of trading cards released topps in the and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summers independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and bigbudget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day was painfully middleoftheroad appeal the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks has fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination danny elfmans thundering theremindriven score is absolutely jawdropping it is so overwhelming that swear you had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes we get glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in purplesequined cape when television message is broadcast the people of the world naturally the only way communicate earthlings is preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according tim burton it is good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs the aliens because burtons just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars anyone who comes mars attacks expecting see lot of one favorite actor is bound be disappointed few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the progresses jack nicholson is lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangeloves buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power the role of the first lady and martin short is presidential aide who meets the martians in the white houses kennedy room secluded nook where he unwittingly tries seduce an alien dressed up as bighaired pointybreasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene it is made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael fox is her newsman husband the octogenarian sylvia sidney has funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress and plays decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace jim brown and tom jones are the films vegasbased heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has funny cameo as the unfortunate french president also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allens everyone says love you the real stars of course are the computergenerated martians and they are fantastic bare brains glistening atop their grinning skullfaces round eggeyes red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dantes gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burtons little monsters are more inventive the films raison detre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged pay special attention the pg rating it is earned the special effects vary from charming astonishing deliciously cheesy and at least couple of shots of mass destruction seem have been engineered specifically in response independence day although mars attacks was in production long before that films release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomass wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenbergs movie will almost certainly be more somber it will not be released in the s until early next year but mars attacks is surely similarly elegant nightmare this is not nice movie and studio executive was duped into giving burton million make it setting the films final scenes in the nearly empty holocaustravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burtons invasion epic suggests that the world we have got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously selfabsorbed and good thing too since the movies wicked charm is dependent on our ability take this invasion partly as wishfulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible the kitschiest strains of american pop culture ultimately this messy masterpiece is the years funniest comedy and weird winking affirmation of the power of the people,1.0

getting it right is far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from summer movie about male virginity the was directed randal kleiser who brought us such bubblegum classics as grease and the blue lagoon but thanks kleisers surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script getting it right is pleasantly quiet moving and memorable filmone geared strictly toward sophisticated adult audience getting it right stars jesse birdsall emily lloyds boyfriend in wish you were here as gavin painfully shy yearold hairdresser who lives at home his parents and whogaspis still virgin gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon but expose him single yearold beauty and he is mess much gavins surprise the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan lynn redgrave rich married and lonely yearold getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts get it right that is find the right woman fulfill his life getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely indepth character development gavins selfconscious voiceover narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion assertive and selfconfident maturity birdsalls superb understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the he seems convincing and authentic throughout the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavins life despite her limited screen time redgrave makes quite splash in the movie as gavins middleaged seducer for supporting character joan is unusually and impressively complex thanks in large part redgraves magnificent performance gavin is also pursued or perhaps plagued minnie the totally neurotic daughter of rich aristocrat after minnie and gavin meet at party she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role and sir john gielgud his tongue in his cheek embodies the height of arrogance as her father gavins eventual loveinterest is jenny the adorable twentyyearold single mother who assists him at the beauty salon london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields touchingly sweet character peter cook the great british satirist appears briefly in the as gavins uptight employer the scenes of gavins home life his parents are also treat gavins overprotective mother pat heywood whom even woody allen would find overbearing almost steals the movie her life seems limited just two activities treating gavin like yearold and preparing exotic but inedible meals such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken chocolate sauce gavin and his fathers attempts avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing getting it right for the most part is very wellcrafted except for two minor shortcomings first the movie is about minutes too long and consequently it loses momentum at times second the includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavins best friend harry and his unfaithful lover winthrop overall however getting it right is quite memorable for its humor depth sophistication and outstanding acting director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard adapting her own highly acclaimed novel deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth maturation and selfdiscovery,1.0
no matter what you suspect this is not your usual action thriller the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer it is one of those movies that after everything is revealed rapidfire at the end you immediately want rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on new light plot twists agogo are what you get here gave up trying figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them reveal it me keyser soze is name you will hear at least hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason it is not only the name of the mysterious and possibly even mythical crime boss in the movie it also sums up the movie keyser soze in latin means an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer or maybe should not have bought foreignlanguage dictionary from the same company that makes those cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets at the movies opening group of known criminals are brought in for police lineup including mcmanus stephen baldwin keaton gabriel byrne fenster benicio del toro buckney kevin pollack and verbal kevin spacey winner of the best supporting actor academy awardsymbol times new roman for his performance in the movie verbal is sonamed because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing he also earns his name as the movies narrator spouting memorable lines like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist although obviously he does exist what else could explain kris kross having comeback in while being interrogated police detective chazz palminteri any actor multiple zs in their name is okay in my book we see the story unfold as spacey retells it the five felons upon being released from the lineup get their revenge on the police exposing corrupt taxi service whereby elite criminals pay be smuggled through town in cop cars and stealing all the money and drugs in the car it is definite case of male bonding for the five criminals who later find out they were brought together the unseen keyser soze who sends minion them an offer they cannot refuse namely they have destroy sozes main competitors in organized crime infiltrating ship shooting bunch of people burning all the drugs and stealing million cash spacey does terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent cripple character life and baldwin byrne palminteri and the rest make for good supporting cast the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions an underlying sense of mystery and suspense keeping the viewer guessing until the very end and then still leaving few details open for scrutiny and discussion suppose all that would be cleared up if really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv different mystery guess may turn into _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again,1.0
dangerous beauty is really nothing more than grandiose soap opera set in venice circa it is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and certainly nothing short of entertaining but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness dealing themes of forbidden love religious intolerance subordination of women sexual freedom and the roles of pleasure and sin in highcultured society it still feels like brightly lit fluff the director marshall herskovitz does not want follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down so he opts for more genial livelier and relatively shallow interpretation the takes place during the renaissance time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe at this time venice was its own republic and it thrived on being the central juncture of eastwest commerce the is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice so we rarely get see how the rest of the society lived however there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment the story centers on veronica franco catherine mccormack lower class woman who falls in love marco venier rufus sewell the son of wealthy aristocratic parents jeroen krabb and joanna cassidy unfortunately the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love rather it was more like business transaction where rich families married their sons and daughters each other in order secure power wealth and ensure that outsiders could not get in veronica despite her charm and good looks is certainly an outsider after short love affair marco breaks her heart the news that he cannot marry her however because she is beautiful and intelligent veronica has chance enter marcos world albeit not as his wife she decides become courtesan class of women who were as welleducated as they were ravishing and sold their sexuality wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining the elite courtesan was not mere prostitute they were afforded special place in society and they were greatly revered respected and often envied at one point character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants veronica goes through the transformation the help of her mother paola jacqueline bisset who was once famed courtesan herself once she enters the lifestyle veronica finds that it suits her quite well she is allowed read all the books she wants she is given the opportunity publish her poetry and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet including the awestruck marco their relationship develops into playful bantering veronica utilizing her newfound power constantly rejecting marcos advances in many ways their relationship is sad because marco is married women he is unable love and veronica is consumed multiple relationships men she is unwilling love love the love not the man as her mother told her dangerous beauty was based on factual book margaret rosenthal flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice it has multiple plot lines including veronicas adversarial relationship court poet oliver platt her role in obtaining frances military assistance in venices battle against the turks and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition yet it is never confusing or overbearing much of the films success is due the glowing performance catherine mccormack in the lead role known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibsons ire in braveheart mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of leading lady she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in courtesan her character is intelligent witty and both sensual and vulnerable all of mccormack easily transmits single flash of her eyes the rest of the roles are also filled well including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in dark city have assured him solid place in he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas oliver platt plays variation of the comic relief role that he has come inhabit like second skin although the deals his character cheap blow at the end having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy platt is good actor but he is just too hard hate jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was and even fred ward turns up in small but moving performance as marcos uncle dangerous beauty is marshall herskovitzs sophomore directorial effort after the overlooked jack the bear partnered edward zwick herskovitz has spent most of his time as producer on television thirtysomething my socalled life and in the movies legends of the fall his directing style can be best described as transparent it never gets in the way of the story yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions he could have approached the in any number of ways including overdosing on the sexual aspect he wisely avoids dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex make it appropriately erotic but not so much that it seems exploitative herskovitz is also aided strong supporting crew including the luscious photography bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include the highlystylized thriller kalifornia and abel ferraras dark scifi body snatchers bazelli captures the in strong bold colors and be brings sixteenthcentury venice life in wide panoramic shots that are often enhanced digital imagery however the real details are found in the production design norman garwood brazil the princess bride and the costumes gabriella pescucci the age of innocence the only problem dangerous beauty is that it does not stick you it is good story welltold interesting characters but it is easy shrug off once you have left the theater the only sequence that has the chance be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened the death penalty for her transgressions but it never quite comes off because it is simply too melodramatic and conventional herskovitz tries all his might make it nailbiter but somehow its outcome is foregone conclusion and like the rest of the it carries no real weight despite the potential severity of the subject matter,1.0

steve soderberghs sex lies and videotape won the grand prize at the cannes festival in arguably began the resurgence of independent films made on shoestring budget of million then relatively unknown actors it is provocative thoroughly original drama the mostly focuses on the four central characters all in their late searly ann andie macdowell an unfulfilled housewife is married john peter gallagher an insensitive lawyer who unbeknownst her is having an affair her younger sister cynthia laura san giacomo complicating matters even worse is graham james spader who won best actor at cannes johns old college buddy who comes stay at their house ann is absolutely won over him even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex that is the setup for the last hour of the picture and since the is entitled sex lies and videotape it is best keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as genuine surprise director steven soderbergh has proven be wildly offbeat filmmaker ranging from the independent the mainstream out of sight the downright kafkaesque schizopolis he is the type of director who obviously takes lot of chances and believes in the work that he does and sex lies and videotape is probably his most confident and maybe even best date the performances are superb from all four leads but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character she is always very winning actress but this is probably her most threedimensional role that she has had close second being altmans mosaic short cuts the other parts are perfectly cast as well from spaders ominous graham gallaghers selfinvolved john giacomos outspoken cynthia the final act of the especially comes right out of left field and turns out be both shocking and oddly touching and it would be criminal give away the films secrets suffice say that through one powerful sequence ann is able somewhat come out of her shell and john learns valuable lesson about honesty as well as deception the has one fault however the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another and often unlikable if there had been few extra scenes gallagher it probably would have helped since his relationship macdowell is not quite as explored as would have liked sex lies and videotape although minorly flawed is still easily brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it and the final product certainly proves this,1.0

me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in martin scorsese despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains gifted and versatile screen presence ever since the big success of the actionthriller faceoff in the road has been rocky one for mr cage the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of worst films mm was disappointing lost cause but who better than scorsese match cages wit and intensity he does in miraculous fashion bringing out the dead cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from daytoday after five years of the stressinducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely young girl named rose who stares back at him pale features at every street corner in new york frank desperately wants be fired but his boss needs him scour the city and help those in need i will fire you tomorrow he promises frank is accompanied fresh face every night in the ambulance the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain the second is marcus ving rhames deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into regular rescue operation and finally tom tom sizemore is deranged sociopath hungry for blood found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for single shift frank but they never figured into the actual plot each is merely colorful presence help develop franks character because bringing out the dead is predominantly study of his mind and detailed personality the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of newly admitted patient who suffered from severe heart attack arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around reallife husband cage it is unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during mishandled ineffective finale the movie belongs the onetwo punch of cage and scorsese who were born collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar bringing out the dead although it certainly lacks the grit and hardedge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages hit nerve his latest picture the incredible camerawork and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration fans will be pleased find the director has returned his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of departure kundun does bringing out the dead rival scorseses finest work only occasionally some of the feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in it is interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance suffice those expecting grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straightarrow approach but it is still solid admirable effort bringing out the dead was written the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull schraders script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay the exceptional aspects of the are it is astounding technical credits and the amazing cast goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but it is the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves second look watch the actors deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects gothic band member and you will understand why he won golden globe bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough mask it is certain flaws scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable,1.0
at first glance daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie on second glance it looks that way too although as typical disaster movies go daylight is not that bad admittedly it seems rip off great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone think poseidon adventure but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the have not seen this scene somewhere before feeling that creeps up all too often during the sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new yorks emergency response team sheer luck he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little what disaster is that you ask as you inch ever closer the edge of your seat glad you asked through whole sequence of entirely probable events about as probable as hitting the lottery large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends causes not only massive loss of life but traps dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel good old sly who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses offers his services the rescuers who gladly accept it sly then enters the tunnel through vent shaft think judge dredd he can only go in and not out off and proceeds try rescue those trapped inside so begins the fun but the fun has be quick because this tunnel has started spring leak the acting is about what you would expect of stallone movie not superb any means but far above some of his other films think judge dredd again daylights acting is probably average or little above in terms of this sort of genre starring this particular star amy brenneman is the only actor of any note and she does pretty good job as stallones reluctant helper oh yeah stallones real life son sage is in this too sage nice name guess it could be worse he could have been named nutmeg or parsley note sage you are still young go school and get good education you do not have future in acting the plot runs along the same lines as the acting interesting but predictable mostly due the fact that it was pretty well recycled from dozen other action flicks the biggest problem of this nature is that they try cram too many things into the movie as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle another one seems pop right up even worse than the last one realize that it would not be much of movie otherwise but it does make the movie bit predictable adding the predictability is the cast of characters of course has include at least one or two difficult people who want do things their own way and think the qualified guy in this case stallone does not know what he is doing why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree each other and all work together would this be too much ask cannot we all just get along special effects were not bad but have certainly seen better some of the scenes while fun watch were such blatant ripoffs that you had wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater the tunnel of course starts flood really expected gene hackman roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine appear at any minute was not sure if was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure suppose if you have rip off movie for good ideas the poseidon adventure is good one use the underwater sequences aside from the deja vu were very well shot and worked fairly well they were the best part of the movie long shot better than average stallone flick realize that is not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume but certainly not up the standards of cliffhanger daylight is fun movie and as long as you are not expecting whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised,1.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned like its own opening shot from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the scene stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as bonafide major talent sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of troupe in the adult industry boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking the follows softspoken young man eddie adams mark wahlberg from torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business stardom and later harrowingly precipitous drop as boogie nights opens he is toiling as dishwasher in trendy san fernando valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity recruited fatherly jack horner rejuvenated burt reynolds successful porn filmmaker eddie abandons his old life in favour of new one as dirk diggler pornstar wholeheartedly embraced jacks troupe including the maternal amber waves julianne moore reed rothchild john reilly buck swope don cheadle rollergirl heather graham dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being big bright shining star his lack of discipline however incites chain of circumstances sees dirk and his friends unravel as new decade is ushered in the element of boogie nights literally commands attention is the bravura direction mr anderson whose fascination and prowess the camera is obvious from the terrific tracking shot throughout nightclub opens the and introduces the players through the showy sequence in the camera follows female partygoer diving into pool mr andersons accomplished command of the camera is without question while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork ultimately proves be aggravating impertinent and selfcongratulatory case in point marc roccos unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first in boogie nights every zoom or pan mr anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent it is rarity and delight discover such confidently assured work so early in filmmakers career boogie nights is only his second feature following up his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although it is somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman while in terms of visuals he is clearly influenced martin scorsese at least he is borrowing from some of the best and it is entirely effective within the context of this while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value it is also rollicking good fun wickedly deadpan sense of humour the perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably impeccable production design bob ziembicki and costume design mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back this recent preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited freewheeling lifestyles abounded while much of the films humour pertains the characters obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society prime example is parttime salesman buck swopes demo of stereo system an eighttrack tape and inviting prospective customer get freaky deaky the music it is elicited an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the are strangely wondrous giant ensemble disco dance production number in nightclub is funny be sure but oddly magical and the sequence lovingly explores eddiedirks bedroom completely adorned posters and elements of iconic figures farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee is breathtaking ably supported wellselected collection of period music all of purportedly came straight from mr andersons personal collection there is clear affection for the era in boogie nights it is the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the films promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference the adult industry unites its characters after the debacle milos forman the people vs larry flynt another finelycrafted work was knocked off the market prematurely due controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline the new line marketing team faced unique challenge boogie nights in terms of attempting deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order increase salability the general public however while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult industry of two decades ago it is hardly lurid or seamy given the subject matter there is very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as hotbed of carnality but simply as business the glimpses on the sets of jack horners shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended titillate there is candid matteroffactness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing job and it is refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided if anything boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves jack horners dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires make great and some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood albeit lacking certain wistful innocence in both films the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored and both jack horner and the version of ed wood tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jacks retort of there are shadows in light baby his cinematographers complaint about poor set lighting echoes back ed woods it is not about the little details it is about the big picture rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan from outer space appears patently false in boogie nights and ed wood the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove be bemusing not in their intentions there is nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark much like the humour lacing ed wood the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged after viewing hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this is the best work have ever done it is genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses tinge of sadness mr anderson is at this point clearly greater talent as director than screenwriter while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging there really is not any clever dialogue in the though valid point certainly can be made that none of the films characters particularly lend themselves thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the films protagonist literally does not say single insightful thing throughout the entire minute running time it is no wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the films finest exchanges and while mr anderson creates rich collection of fascinating characters it is problematic that some of the the threads given the films characters are simply stale material julianne moores child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her characters story and far less interesting than the thread dealing her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions still even if he does not always know what do his characters mr anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive selfdestructive insufferable loved them just the same in any case it is hard pick nits screenplay contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately bestexecuted scenes of the year scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along their loosecannon compadre the home of drug baron rahad jackson mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance even if it is small one in suicidal drug deal scam only find that the millionaire is crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal listen the crescendo of night rangers sister christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked an armed bodyguard if this scene already was not tense enough these elements mr anderson introduces chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene new surreal level of delightful giddiness there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights mr anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences depict the prostration of various characters frightening effect similarly painful scene where crew member scotty philip seymour hoffman breaks down in tears in the drivers seat sobbing am so stupid after being rebuffed dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as later scene dirk in the drivers seat after particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening boogie nights is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go mr wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and mr reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the ringing true in every respect handful of other performances might otherwise be overlooked deem mention mr reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbards georgia genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the am not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character tee mr reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and it is wickedly funny watch his reed join in dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during macho altercation worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down numbingly bad and deadon period it sure sounds like bad early me demo track you got the touch in vain attempt at musical career mr reilly plays his vacant character utter conviction is convincing and effective ms graham her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like disney animated heroine come life or in this case disney animated heroine who came life made wrong turn and ended up on the new line lot in focused on the late early adult industry consequently it is bit incongruous see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in scene where she is lounging in limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera hilariously pouty comehither look all one can do is gulp her role in the sadly needs more fleshing out err in figurative sense she is essentially glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity if only mr anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though and cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as teen ms grahams parents forbade her take part in the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been as junkie gus van sants drugstore cowboy and now porn starlet draw your own conclusions perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr cheadle who lends dignity his role as character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested series of changes in his sense of fashion his relationship his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st vincent an interesting melora walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible it is no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application open stereo store is rejected due his background in the porn industry while the scenario is familiar the wounded look in cheadles eyes makes the scene unforgettable luis guzmans most famous work is possibly in brian de palmas carlitos way and here he plays variation on the same character maurice rodriguez is hapless but goodnatured nightclub owner who is hangeron jacks group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack little disguise made of his desperation for part in one of his erotic pictures jacks eventual acquiescence maurices request leads one of boogie nights biggest comic payoffs boogie nights is stunning achievement due the virtuoso direction mr anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the industry as presence of note this work striking fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally wellcrafted there is no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year,1.0
bruce willis and sixth sense director night shyamalan reteam tell the story of david dunne willis stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship his wife and child on return trip from new york where he was trying get job dunne is in horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel jackson who was born degenerative bone disease that causes his bones be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life price felt that there had be someone exactly the opposite of him someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break price contacts dunne and convinces him come down his gallery for talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin superhero from the comic books price used read when he was child dunne does not believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is writerdirector night shyamalan had tough act follow his sleeper hit the sixth sense how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years for shyamalan the answer must have come as easy him as nuclear physics does kindergartners does this new measure up his breakthrough box office smash though the answer that question is not very easy one either as far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable it was not until the surprise ending was revealed that realized the was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order give the audience ample time reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached for unbreakable shyamalan gave the much more satisfying pace in many ways blows away the that had come before the story moves along at steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent the camera almost constantly moving there are tons of great shots in the not least of is conversation that opens the between willis character and another train passenger the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak also very impressive is the films score james newton howard who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar stir of echoes as well as this years dinosaur several of the scenes are driven very catchy beat and help increase the tempo of the one of the best examples of this is scene in dunne goes into train station exercise his powers the music in combination the stellar visuals really go long way towards making this an incredible movie if there was any one soundtrack would make must purchase this year this one would be it the also boasts some great performances including precocious child actor trying vie for the oscar throne left vacant haley joel osment willis turns in great performance as the sad sack dunne who just cannot seem figure out why he is been depressed for the last few years his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage jackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah though his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems infuse such great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked robin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire make things work again spencer treat clark as the dunnes young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the out of all the characters jeremys is perhaps the most emotional and clark does great job the role where the does lose points though is during its surprise ending shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going do an ending that blew away the one presented the sixth sense but found myself saying that was it when unbreakable revealed its own ending it is not that the ending is bad it is just that the ending does not quite have the emotional punch that the other films did plus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and will not reveal the ending here but you will understand what mean when you see it essentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good unbreakable the only real problem is that the ending does not quite fill the shadow left its predecessor as long as it is not held the standard that sixth sense set it ultimately will be it should be remarkably well liked one thing seems clear though shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like share the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this,1.0

steven spielberg is now considered as one of the deities because of the rare capability deliver both huge commercial hits like jurassic park and oscar awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list however in the spielberg built his reputation creating works of art that could slip in both categories one of them is close encounters of the third kind extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle unfortunately it had bad luck be released in the same year as star wars although both films have lot in common groundbreaking special effects brilliant score john williams their future was different one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow when spielberg began work on that project he was already established as bright new star due his previous commercial hit jaws together other young directors of his new generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius he exploited the great creative freedom of when even the mainstream producers dared experiment ironically it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of blockubuster philosophy but in the mid many things were different spielberg was young and eager use resources for his very personal and artistic movie although very personal spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book ufo experience dr allen hynek and in many ways inspired the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors earth that began grow in the world after ww spielberg was not only inspired the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot the story begins one of such incidents team of international scientists come the sonorra desert in mexico find the s navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight such events coincide the ufo incident witnessed roy neary richard dreyfuss power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed his experience because of his obsession he loses his job family and sanity but his loss is nothing compared the experience of jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction in the meantime the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and s government in cooperation the french led lacombe francois truffaut begin the preparation for ultrasecret project when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area there he is joined jillian who shared the similar visions two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination find whatever is there spielberg here shows great mastery using the very same techniques of jaws make completely different effects the slow gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents close encounters is set in order bring the viewer the great revelation in the finale but instead of the fear and horror we had endure during the jaws we are now overwhelmed the sense of boyish wonder throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big magnificent and wonderful is about happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end the last sequence its even in this age impressive special effects the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouths open one of the great virtues of this is its optimism aliens who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is beginning of something wonderful it is very ironic when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat the mankind spielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast the pessimistic mood of its era the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public but even such government is much more harmless compared the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions there lies the main and probably the only flaw of this great picture lack of conflict and consequently lack of drama the movie has few excitements or even action scenes especially the last that may be an interesting homage hitchcocks north northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government aliens are the good guys despite such shortcomings the actors were good and manage bring multidimensionality their simple roles richard dreyfuss is very convincing as ordinary yet nice guy who sinks into insanity only rediscover himself in grand finale melinda dillon was on the other hand nominated for oscar as struggling mother yet she was overshadowed teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie apart from visual wonders of this spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both as the element of plot and as the basis for his score the aliens who are the main subject of this were visually very convincing too convincing one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said according him the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people big eyes was so accurate that it managed freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos so they later approached spielberg and ordered him make another movie alien this time designed be anything but the real life the result was t for many years the

the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the noir genre in crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo millers crossing blood simple and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric scatterbrained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even touch of satire be found in this the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but did not quite have the brains get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like fairly intelligent guy who is wise the world but he does not really want do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced the films rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county the dude is unemployed needless say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley his two best friends walter john goodman borderlinepsychotic who is in the habit of pulling gun when he thinks somebodys cheating in bowling match has the whole world gone crazy he shouts at suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi who is always few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here these three seem more or less live for bowling tournaments and as the begins they are anticipating an important match rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing dance in the bowling lane accompany spanish version of hotel california and if it is possible seems be even more of head case than walter if that does not give you good idea of this films absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario drives the story is set in motion two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dudes rug they have mistaken him for millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he does not have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him deliver the million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff and before they can try again get the money the supposed kidnappers the dudes car gets stolen along the briefcase containing the money soon the dude is being harassed not only the big lebowski himself but also treehorn and group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order extort money from her husband repay her debts treehorn meanwhile the big lebowskis daughter maude julianne moore feminist avantgarde artist who likes make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants recover the money for her family the plot however is really just vehicle for all these bizarre characters run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases the sometimes bewildered dude left run through it and try avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the does not feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dudes dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact the sometimes seems little disjointed as result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out be somewhat anticlimactic resolution there is also noticeable but not too heavyhanded thread of social commentary in the big lebowski incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim at just about every elite a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on the end we really start admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in overflowing quirky characters he also turns out have pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head even if he does not like use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he is getting run around and he does manage unravel the kidnapping mystery the end the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they do not just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski standout comedy it manages approach characters like the dude and some extent walter genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first it is good knowin he is out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken,1.0

oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated in perfect world civil action would be breath of fresh air it is cynical about lawyers in way that grisham is not it is romantic in the exact opposite way grisham bookfilm is not and the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in films is that above all else you must have an ending even if it is based on true story true story has not yet ended you must supply an ending false one but an ending nevertheless hell civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as classic yet it is also oddly and slightly unsatisfying weird this is in fact steve zallian not just the work of hack and zallian is the director of the muchadmired search for bobby fischer did not see it and writer of none other than schindlers list in short like this guy and am sucker for the way he tells his stories after all apart from the obvious it isaholocaustfilm and it isaspielbergfilm is not schindlers list just damn brilliant not so much holocaust as it is wonderful character study civil action is the same way it is narrative is split between being lawyer and being character study and it is here that the seems go bit wrong the main complaint of this is that while yes it is an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and that is not necessarily the problem the it is that it is just kind of unsatisfying if this were great it would feel complete and still end basically the same way but this just seems end and do not want be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the is about looking forward this and then discovered the truth has been through surrealistic and unpleasant filter just so the many will not bitch about what is essentially genuine but the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong it it is rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who is shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because he is manipulative and he always wins it wishes make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full we see him suffering from personal crisis and travolta does do pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we do not fully believe it and think that the problem is when he has made his decision the choses an odd angle go at noble one but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness in the opening of the we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases in short he is full of bullshit and we know it in the he takes case that is hardly desired town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems be from local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river point one it is not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children are not nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success point two it has been through several lawyers after turning them down jan changes his mind muddled scene he stops his car on bridge looks out is he feeling sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william macy head out the town do battle the towns company they spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant they also find themselves clashing brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played robert duvall more on him later on as we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is bit james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins have personal crisis things begin go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only strickler but pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or loyal testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent find it and they are quickly running out of money as macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin feel real loss of hope for our protagonist in fact the last half hour is such change from the rest of the and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up par owen gleiberman especially criticized the for not being overlydramatic suppose like grisham novel this would not be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having change of heart and automatically being perceived as good he is seen as being still full of bullshit because he does not take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how bring that out the final half tries redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind but what follows is series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he is seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that he is not rich and esteemed anymore the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow the fault is not that there is no closure the court case it is still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has we need feel like the character has really made big change in his life and that the story is how story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such whopping change in his personal life it only feels like half of that maybe even less and it is not travolta who does great job here though never be truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite up then though it is an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period the reason is because it recognizes that court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather it is about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother we learn that the company is almost positively blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it cannot be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find and duvalls facher is such brilliant character and he does such magnificent job at portraying that man that it is almost easy overlook how subtley great he is facher is seen as an elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making point take time out of his day listen the radio and scold anyone who interupts him but look deeper and you see master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and it is difficult as hell clearly generalize him in any way that is why liked this it is hard put pointer on you can never see exactly where this will land and even when the credits roll you still are not sure what make of it call it the zallian effect same thing happened schindlers list not that am comparing oskar schindler jan schlictman each is so greatly crafted that you cannot help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along it if only it felt totally complete like say schindlers list though at this point it may be unfair make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along that full breath of fresh air,1.0

in the opening shot of midnight cowboy we see closeup of blank movie screen at drivein we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves without an image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen images of old westerns in our minds eye even without having seen cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images of them seem have found their way into our mental schema but do cowboys really exist or are they merely images personified john wayne and gary cooper exploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as metaphor for the american dream an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept is the ease at salvation and success can be attained in america hallmark of its experience or an urban legend midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image of the cowboy is merely myth as joe buck migrates from place place he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt create life for himself only further degeneration during the opening credits joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne the alamo as joe is on the bus listening radio talk show lady on the air describes her ideal man as gary cooper but he is dead troubled expression comes across joes face as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone having adopted the image of cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted the persona he tried embody joes persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue his american dream he romanticizes about making it in the big city but his dreams will desert him as he is forced compromise his ideals for sustenance the end of midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on blank screen we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success but how realistic are these ideals joe had raped and been raped in texas the scars of his troubled past prompt him migrate new york but he does not know that his aspirations be cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation the ability pack up ones belongings and start anew seems be an exclusive american convention schlesinger provides us strong hints as joes abusive and abused past flashbacks of improper relationships crazy anne and granny we understand that joe adopts the fa ade of cowboy symbol of virility and gallantry as an attempt neutralize his shame he runs from his past only be sexually defiled this time his homosexual experiences in new york in the scene at the diner foreshadows joes encounter the gay student joe buck spills ketchup on himself standing up we see the ketchup has made red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joes virility eliciting an image of bleeding genitals signifying emasculation beyond the symbol of castration the scene may also connote the bleeding of virgins first sexual encounter reference joes first homosexual liaison the fact that the idea of bleeding virgin is relegated only females furthers the imagery of joes emasculation it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and faggot stuff there are two predominant images of new york the first is that new york is the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty the other new york is travis bickles new york seedy corruptive hell on earth joe envisions new york as the former but is presented the latter mirroring the irony in joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled lonely women neglected gay men joe thinks he is performing great service for new york but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions the people steal joes money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity what has become of joes american dream schlesinger responds this question the scene at the party joe gets invited shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed dizzying array of food drugs and sex at the party all of joe and ratzos desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully women and ratzo loads up on free salami contrasting joes daily struggles shots of warhols crew display wanton indulgence there is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude we see shot of woman kowtowing nothing in particular orgies breaking out in the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors the party makes mockery of joe ideals joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america scenes of the party and his rendezvous shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joes toils the american dream schlesinger suggests is merely proletarian fantasy for those who are content no longer dream but become indolent as joe heads miami all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished for joe nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately he surrenders the identity tossing his boots into the garbage he returns the bus for the last leg of his journey miami the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only few glances outside the window instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way new york schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window joe hardly taking notice the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before the world seems smaller joe now the termination of his journey coincides the termination of his american dream no longer does joe aspire be the enterprising gigolo he resolves return normal job and resign basic means midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough repel few indians you can set up ranch out west and raise beautiful family then there is the jay gatsby dream that man of humble stock perseverance can make fortune in the big city joes attempt realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york during his search for an intangible paradise joe ends up raping girl and killing man an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream joe bucks progressive moral atrophy is warning against the pursuit of illusory icons,1.0

eric rohmers pauline at the beach is one of those small deliberately paced but charming foreign films in not much happens plot wise but lot happens the characters emotionally the takes place during few weeks of august at the normandy coast and centers on six different characters primarily pauline amanda langlet wise beyond her years yearold who has come stay for the summer her older cousin marion arielle dombasle on the first day at the beach marion runs into an old high school flame fedoore atkine and although he wants rekindle their relationship she is more interested in an older more seductive womanizer pascal greggory who is also secretly having an affair candy vendor rosette while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults she forms relationship of her own young teenage boy simon de la brosse pauline at the beach is not in big dramatic things occur and there is not clearcut tidy conclusion the story instead it is picture that simply observes its characters in every day life and the surprises come from little character details the is quite talky and slow moving and so it is pretty safe say it is not for those who are only fan of action movies but is treat for those viewers who often like venture outside of the bigbudget genre and see good art this is the first acclaimed director eric rohmer my night at mauds and claires knee that have seen but his direction is assured and intelligent as is the screenplay he also wrote pauline at the beach is worth seeing,1.0
after rather disappointing mary railly stephen frears is now officially back in business comeback worthy of praise this is one of the best surprises of this season sweet small budget comedy big heart in fact it is not even comedy it is drama or even more precise clever satire on human relationships and needs based on critically acclaimed novel british author nick hornby high fidelity is wry and likable story about mans quest for fulfillment and happiness rob gordon was dj it seems that he could make everything spin except his own life now he owns championship vinyl little musical store somewhere in new york when he suddenly gets dumped his girlfriend gorgeous blond attorney life suddenly looses every purpose decimated humiliated and on the verge of mental and emotional breakdown he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been about what is right and what is important he starts categorizing life dividing it into top lists and the most important is the top list over the most painful breakups of his life starting th grade when he found his young girlfriend another boy though you might think that people change grow more mature age it just does not seem that way and all robs relationships were different versions of that first where did he go wrong was it he that screwed up or maybe life just stinks while he is lost in his own selfpity he must think of the top list over his needs for the future find the right elements and mix his life together clever parallels the cult of celebrity music and incredibly direct narration it addresses the average audience member in other words people like you and me although lot of this honor should be addressed the screenwriter ______ and frears the director the acting is equally important as the written word and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned he is simply superb it is as much his movie as it is frears the would not be the same without him cusack whose character is sadder wiser and brings intelligence and warmth post mod irony most of his dialogue is delivered directly the camera not an easy task but cusack pulls it off his interpretation feels so emotionally right so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply cannot be ignored or overseen the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job both ______ and jack black are fabulous even catherine zeta jones appears in role where she actually acts not just looks beautiful however the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided todd louiso who delivers spectacular comic performance as robs coworker and friend dick this is such an impressive achievement that it is almost worth oscarnomination he is simply joy behold otherwise everyone are in their place and at the right time all part of frears colorful blend pretty much like edward nortons keeping the faith this does not follow any formula or belong any genre it is dramatic tragic sarcastic comic and even cynical but never bitter or angry it is little bit of everything pretty much like life itself nothing seems unreal or staged it reflects reality as mirror as you watch it you go through the same emotional problems as the main character you feel and think and reflect this effect has become rarity nowadays although it is primarily about the perils of love high fidelity is secondarily about pop music rob owns championship vinyl and his employees timid dick todd louiso and overbearing barry jack black are fellow music snobs music is the language in their lives the measure they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives and so does the movie it is as much musical as anything else as robs journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments in the end you have gained something while watching it it is not the of the century or even of the year it is not an special effects extravaganza it does not require big explosions or digital creatures succeed it is small movie about the big things and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy you feel as if you have experienced something of significance and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time,1.0
plot group of asbestos cleaners get job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum as each day passes the crew members begin discover things about the place and themselves set other things in motion saying anything else about the plot would be crime have fun critique feel like shooting myself in the head are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie good indication as what kind of expect here this as not your average happy go lucky kind of picture this is deliberately slowpaced mysteryhorror drenched in atmosphere very creepy insane asylum in most of the takes place very few clues upfront and lots talk about afterwards will it bore some people sleep you bet it will is it made for the scream audiences of the day absolutely not guess you can describe this as horror movie for the cerebral crowd that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame giving away very little each step and each sound unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up world of revelations and plenty more discuss later have always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this fits right into that group in fact guess can pussyfoot around the actual word all want but the best way describe this kind of movie is mindfuck if you feel like watching movie that moves very slowly gives you handful of characters divergent backgrounds tosses few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together well then this movie is definitely for you it is the kind of that you actually have see twice fully appreciate damn missed that whole peanut butter thing and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark brrrrrrrrr now what was that sound in the basement honey can you go check and one thing this does not have unlike its hollywoodian counterparts like the haunting is special effects in fact that is one of the greater things about this movie it feels real because it looks like it is actually taped on video very credible actors in very credible circumstances did some research and it was in fact shot on digital video ahha another great thing about it is that it is actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen it is mostly implied kids and as clich as it might be say it is usually much scarier when stuff is left our imagination or implied in movies as such other films that this one reminded me of include henry portrait of serial killer and the blair witch project that same real sense of dread brooding and terror the does however move awfully slow and if you really do not get into it completely you really need concentrate here you will lose the motion of the story and the pentup tension might be released but overall this is yet another great example of the horror genre making very cool comeback this year no tight tanktops in sight and david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can how can you go wrong definitely not for everyone but mustsee for anyone looking throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed count me in stanley kubrick would be proud oh yeah so where is that gun again where is joblo coming from the blair witch project blair witch the haunting the house on haunted hill lost highway the pledge the shining the sixth sense unbreakable,1.0

as fairy tales go cinderella has be one of the most famous almost everyone knows it well at least in north america so it is natural that someone will try make movie out of it it has been done before varying results this version of the story is both similar the original and different at the same time the basic story remains unchanged but one thing that seems vanish this version and that is all the fantastical elements of the story there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least unlike in the fairy tale the prince plays much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end the prince who happens be the crown prince the throne of france meets cinderella known as danielle on few occasions most coincidentally and he becomes smitten her although this seems be far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot proceed enough room for some imaginative story telling the story takes place in renaissance setting in france leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion this addition of leonardo da vinci was quite successful in that it added some color the movie since some of the roles are bit stereotypical for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves few things be desired for instance the character seems be bit too unstable and fickle crown prince should not be anything remotely like that especially since he is portrayed be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready take the throne the characters of danielle cinderella played drew barrymore and that of the evil step mother played anjelica huston are well developed and well played the two women although the part of danielle is bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable the nuances of the character are brought out well drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie as contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique but anjelica huston seems add certain flair the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told make it interesting and enjoyable the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise all in all this movie takes you back into history into seemingly magical fairy land but do not get me wrong there is nothing but reality it is just refreshing watch movie that is not based in familiar setting everyday familiar things happening so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not and that adds dimension the in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing,1.0

ogre whose green color not only serves as skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings murphy succeeds his donkey through recreating the highstrung persona that so many know the actor have off screen cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princessogre sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack while the direction and voice work certainly

in an insiders look at scandalridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clintons campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship now the book primary colors has been made into movie directed mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems be more relevant than ever but the is more than diatribe against or paean in praise of the president it is fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics jack stanton john travolta is the governor of small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination he is charismatic but has several flaws threaten doom his campaign and strains his relationship his wife susan emma thompson the is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of civil rights leader who is swept away stantons ideals and helps organize the campaign he joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney governor stantons past repeatedly pops up haunt him fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses his advantage help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates the acting throughout primary colors is superb it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone she enlivens the atmosphere energy in truly boisterous performance travolta does fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray little emma thompson delivers strong performance as his suffering wife who cannot let anything show that might hurt the presidential run the problem political movies is that they tend alienate over half of their audience promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague the point of boredom primary colors treads lightly on this issue though stanton is clearly portrayed as democrat and there are few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues in fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road the white house rather than issues the is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control although the strays into some obviously nonclinton territory it is difficult completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem highlight the presidents current troubles primary colors chief problem is its length it runs about minutes too long there are some scenes could have easily been cut for example midway through the the candidate gives speech an assembly of laid off machinists the scenes only apparent purpose is establish stantons character has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the the extra length is not long enough nor tiring enough be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent republicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able find something like in primary colors it is funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process,1.0
this movie was one of the first american films done director paul verhoeven he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers all of his movies have one main thing in common they do not skimp on the violence in verhoeven movie guy does not get shot once in the chest he gets shot many times all over the body robocop takes place in detroit in the future things are pretty bleak the company ocp rules the city an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force peter weller plays cop who goes on mission his partner nancy allen peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed meanwhile ocp has failed demonstration of ed model robot crime fighter someone comes up the idea of having cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after the plot of this movie generally runs at decent pace it drags bit towards the end robocop wanting finish everybody off but plot twists keep it exciting the acting is bad from weller when he is human but very good when he is robocop nancy allen does decent job this movie does not leave itself open for sequel exactly but they made one anyway enter robocop starring peter weller and nancy allen directed irvin kershner detroit is in more bleak state than it was in the first ocp is trying develop an improved robocop that will be more than match for criminals most of the police force is on strike due ocp taking it over leaving robocop be the police force in the city this is pretty bizaare it has yearold druglord who curses as much as eddie murphy even more violence than the original and some more humor the plot of this movie is pretty large almost too much so there are three or four plot lines weaving around that do not really match up the effects are still decent though this sequel is not more of the same really just darker version robocop dealing more drugs than armed criminals if you liked the first one watch this but be dissapointed so later comes robocop starring nancy allen and robert john burke ocp is now owned large japanese company robocop joins band of rebels counterattack the evil empire mean ocp the japanese send cyborgninja deal robocop among other things this movie is easier follow than the last one means the plot is not quite as crowded this movie is not anything special though just more of robocop blasting things up in more kidfriendly way really not reccomended,1.0

note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned milos formans first since the illfated valmont columbias the people vs larry flynt is vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and selfmade millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late and early the unweaves its tale in chronological order we open young and dirtpoor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky cut forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler gogo clubs in cincinnati the strip clubs are in dire financial state and in lastditch effort salvage the operations flynt decides go print shop and churn out promotional newsletter this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine creating larry flynt vast financial empire and the rest is history what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed an assassination attempt and his driven singleminded insistence buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost the people vs larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynts true love althea leasure whom he meets as dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations considering the serious nature of the films theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully lighthearted and humourous much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynts outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing the subjectivity of obscenity the films focus is on the flynts many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive his friends and colleagues but althea we see his loving affectionate side there is scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking ultimately the emotional power that the hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and altheas love for each other woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly careertopping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt harrelson plays flynt the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness make him endearing and entirely sympathetic the audience and very compelling protagonist for the courtney love plays althea leasure in startling turn completely raw and impulsive it is very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling it is difficult take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry harrelson is deadon edward norton as flynts straight levelheaded lawyer is often upstaged his flashier costars in the people vs larry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the one can sense the frustration that nortons character feels when harrelsons freetalking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him openly speaking his mind and this results in heightened emotional punch when nortons isaacman has the opportunity sway the supreme court judges milos forman keeps the moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the is very effective eliciting great deal of empathy for subject could be construed some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic there is also great visual technique forman uses indicate the passing of time in one shot is both clever and extremely entertaining two minor quibbles the it certainly seems like the people vs larry flynt is in rush get its main theme flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech consequently the first thirty minutes of the introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due the fact that these characters are so interesting but felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in more leisurely fashion it also felt like there was distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on deeper level for example why larry flynt was compelled ruth carter stapleton president carters sister be bornagain is mystery me then again perhaps it was him as well these two points do not detract greatly from the the people vs larry flynt is certainly among the very best studioreleased films of and works both as ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths larry flynt would go advance the cause of free expression and as touching love story,1.0

denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season give very impressive milestone performances this perhaps may be washingtons very best date he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent this season become his character copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting the hurricane much better than it actually is when his rubin hurricane carter feels pain and is tormented racism he creates for the audience great sense of sympathy disgust and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws support silly prejudices the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place few decades ago the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone as his tortured carter sum up the troubles of racism in americas history he is that amazing the problem the hurricane is that when compared washington all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles mainly because the script focuses so much on carter that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors this is without doubt washingtons movie but in order for any be completely satisfying it must utilize everyone in the cast their highest potential not just the stars denzel washington is the only reason see this for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance as rubin carter we see black man whose existence has been punching bag for the white american court system from the age of eleven twenty one he was sent juvenile prison for crime he did not commit then after successful marriage and boxing career he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for triple murder carters second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous powerful white men who refused let him succeed from these past experiences in jail carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america after several court appeals an autobiography and many public marches for his freedom carter remained locked in prison it was not until young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carters book in the that serious battle for freedom took place the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide dedicate all of their time the case until carter is released the greatest scenes in the are when carter begins lose his mind after spending three months in isolation washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go jail again he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career the devastation in washingtons eyes show man who has struggled do the right thing his whole life only be punished for it in the hole carter attempts maintain emotional balance but he cannot his anger is heightened point of no control we see multiple carters violent angry one silent passive one and mediator we see an emotional boxing match inside carters head from this point in the hole the end of the this fight continues it is very apparent at times side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is direct switch from angry caring or the opposite when carter sees that white canadians want help him get out of prison the angry carter at first erupts white people have been trying hurt him his whole life this reminder leads anger in his head however as the continues and the canadians continue help carter we see the calm side him he realizes that society is changing that racism is decreasing and now carter wants leave jail immediately and become part of this world very rarely have seen such determination perfect his role as washington has done here if only the other actors had this same determination dan hedaya ridiculously plays the man who sends carter prison twice forcing witnesses lie and switching evidence around it felt like his character was taken straight out of scooby doo episode he would have gotten away it if it was not for those annoying little kids the kids in this are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship carter underdeveloped and unbelievable the lawyers who help release carter also are underused as is clancy brown as kind prison guard the complete opposite of his character in shawshank redemption there is great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears hedaya was superb in clueless same for david paymer in get shorty harris yulin in ghostbusters and liev schreiber in the daytrippers it is mystery how this many actors signed on such shallow roles on the other hand it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed play rubin hurricane carter this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get,1.0
note after claiming otherwise my appetite was indeed whetted kenneth branaghs hamlet search out other attempts translate shakespeare in hopes of finding better mousetrap as it happens it did not take long is there more romantic director than franco zeffirelli known mainly american audiences as the man behind romeo and juliet required viewing for many high schoolers and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare he is also favorite at the metropolitan opera where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many puccini aria last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre one of the twin peaks wuthering heights of romantic literature it might seem peculiar then that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen at first blush hamlet is far removed from romance the hero though prince is depressed conflicted and confused the ostensible love interest gets little screen time and her scenes her prince are usually as an object of mockery the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus it is zeffirellis genius however that he is able expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace in this italian masters hands romance is everywhere in sons worship of his father in the bonds of deepest friendship in the private thoughts of young lovers even in the mystery of castles the sea after all the story hinges on ghost and what could be more romantic than that what seemed like cheap way sell tickets at the time turned out be one of the most romantic gestures of all namely hiring thenreigning hunk mel gibson play the lead who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and lethal weapon in the series of the same name would have the skill succeed in the most famous role in the english language franco zeffirelli that is who and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money what gibson brings the role is naturalness and ease makes the whole story meaningful not mention comprehensible his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed his movements and gestures excepting his sometimes too active eyes are totally in keeping the character this is hamlet whose pain we feel whose struggle we empathize and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at films end glenn close the other big name in the production also does well the script and satisfies as hamlet us mother gertrude though must confess am still trying understand the character as written zeffirellis incestuous interpretation of hamlet us relationship his mother does not help alan bates makes believably evil claudius without resorting the mannerisms of heavy and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably of special note are the cinematography david watkin and the score ennio morricone both support the realistic mood marvelously as do the sets and costumes without any overstated effects that declare this is important this is shakespeare particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all the melody of wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due perhaps it is difficult call edited shakespeare definitive and there are certainly quite few other filmed versions of hamlet that have not seen but if you have ever felt the urge overcome your fear of the bard this hamlet is an excellent place start,1.0

whenever writerdirector robert altman works in specific genre he has the tendency rewrite it on his own terms he made the west dirty in mccabe and mrs miller he parodied hardboiled detective stories in the long goodbye and he transformed cartoon into flesh and blood popeye the same holds true for his most recent the gingerbread man reinvents genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years the john grisham movie the time the gingerbread man was completed there was very little evidence that it was ever based on story grisham there is no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise matthew mcconaughey chris odonnell or matt damon and it does not feature great showdown in courtroom instead of being grand ode the powers of the legal profession the gingerbread man is rainsoaked southern gothic noir thriller wildly eccentric characters twisting plot line black humor somewhat bleak ending and even altmans trademark fullfrontal female nudity the central character of the is rick magruder who is unlike any of grishams other lawyer heroes he is older experienced and rich he drives cherryred mercedes that never gets dirty even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah georgia where the story unfolds rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce his wife leeanne famke janssen and he rarely gets see his two children jeff jesse james and libby mae whitman reason is never given for the divorce but it is not hard surmise that ricks womanizing had large part in it whenever he is late pick up the kids on his visitation days leeanne always assumes it is because he is been screwing around after an office party celebrating another of his court victories he has not lost in eight years rick becomes involved mallory doss embeth davidtz one of the catering waitresses he drives her home because her car has been stolen and they end up in bed together rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked her slightly psychotic father dixon doss robert duvall grungy stringy barefooted old man who leads commune of other greasy old codgers it was actually dixon who stole her car that night and when rick asks why mallory replies that he always does weird stuff like that as another character puts it dixon is few beers short of sixpack rick ends up convincing mallory have dixon brought court and tried for competency he succeeds information dug up clyde pell private investigator friend robert downey jr and testimony from mallorys begrudging exhusband pete randle tom berenger dixon is put in mental hospital but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out from there the story delves into kidnapping murder doublecrossing and even hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence the action altmans cinematographer changwei gu gives the dark soaked look if it is not nighttime at least it is raining gu shoots the interiors are almost all dark wood paneling minimum of light great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods altman uses create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability in the city there is danger enough but when rick has venture into the woods you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre from westerns epic dramas comedies but no matter what the genre he is always sure give it the altman stamp usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings the gingerbread man is no different although his style is much more restrained here however without those little touches the could have easily slumped into routine actionthriller great deal of the credit for the films success can be given the actors especially branagh who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction here the british actor consistently maintains serviceable southern drawl while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic rick is an extremely flawed man but branaugh brings real humanity his character without it the entire would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling ricks pain and frustration the supporting actors also put in fine performances including embeth davidtz who is probably best known for her heartbreaking role as the jewish maid in schindlers list tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief and robert duvall spends most of his onscreen time just looking weird it does not seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue but watch him closely during the films one courtroom scene his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing while the gingerbread man is not in league altmans greatest works like nashville or the player it is nonetheless solid piece of genre filmmaking may prove successful vehicle restart his somewhat lagging career some critics love stamp films like this as commercial as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at tiny audience and do not make money altman has done something much better he took what could have been generic movie and investing artistry and effort he made it into something more,1.0

say any of you know how madison brad asshole majors barry bostwick shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend in the early stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted make musical homage the crazy bmovies he had grown up as child set bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design the result was the stage play the rocky horror show opened fairly decent reviews in london in and was even hailed the best musical of prominent drama critics in england the play was so successful that the rights were immediately snapped up and production on the began mere year later in october of the version now titled the rocky horror picture show was released in and immediately tanked at the box office whether it was because fox was not quite sure how market it audiences or that audiences did not quite know what make of it themselves has never really been determined but the one common bit of knowledge about the was that it was huge flop it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about the stage version had not been infused into the version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters year later something entirely strange and magical happened prints of the started be distributed theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country and it was then that whole new audience found the this new audience was prone dressing up like the characters from the acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played yelling rude comments at the screen and just generally having good time word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive and the rocky horror picture show is life as the ultimate cult was born for the virgins out there who are unaware the plot centers around loving couple brad majors barry bostwick and janet weiss susan sarandon who come from small town called denton brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want be wed they plan trip see the man who led their meeting dr everett scott jonathan adams who played the narrator in the original stage version but their car gets flat on the way his home remembering castle they had seen back few miles down the road they decide walk there and see if the residents have phone they might be able use call for assistance the castle is actually the home of race of aliens from the planet transsexual in the galaxy of transylvania who are lead the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr franknfurter tim curry franknfurter has masterminded the secret creating life and has done so in the form of rocky peter hinwood as rocky becomes accustomed his new environment brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of franknfurters mad schemes little do any of them know that the doctors handyman riffraff original author richard obrien and domestic magenta patricia quinn are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth going back and revisiting this after ten years being the first time had ever seen it it is amazing me that this ever got made or has had the staying power that it has if had been fox executive around the time of its release do not think would have known what make of it either for all intents and purposes it is bad movie though bad in really good sort of way but sumptuous production design and great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help increase the likability of the the time the credits role it is fairly easy have gotten wrapped up in the and its characters and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was fan of the old cheesy bmovies his is based on when say that the walltowall songs are catchy what really mean say is that once you hear them they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity it goes without saying that the time warp is the most popular song in the even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song what those who have not seen the movie do not know though is that there are even more songs in the that are just as worthy of acknowledgment my personal favorite is over at the frankenstein place but dammit janet is also maddeningly catchy tim currys vocals on the rocking tune sweet transvestite need be heard be believed the finale of the big floor show staged franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets including barry bostwick frightening features no less than four songs rose tint my world do not dream it wild and untamed thing and am going home all of are immensely singable the films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though despite the catchiness of the songs this movie would have been long forgotten about if it had not have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night rush out and be part of their own little floor show watching this at home is nothing compared actually experiencing this in theater hundreds of rabid fans unless you do not mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place note director jim sharman brought back the central characters of the in the form of sequel resulting in the very much forgotten shock treatment picks up brad and janet this time played cliff de young and jessica harper as contestants on game show in their home town of denton the two are menaced the evil tv station manager also played de young who wishes claim janet as his own obrien returned as writerperformer on the project as did quinn campbell and gray in performance capacity only but the had nowhere near the spirit of the original years later this is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at

kevin smith is like big kid his humor is that of sophisticated juveniles he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books having also written few he also has cult following mostly composed of teenagers college students and smiths own fellow adolescentminded grownups smith is hilarious in person and in writing but when he tries be earnest and moralize that is when he goes wrong kevin smith is better writer than director and he will be the first tell you that that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavyhanded great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them this was true in the overrated chasing amy and it is true for dogma as well that is not say smiths message is bad one in dogma smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior anyone elses basically dogmatism is bad changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight they also know what is best for you whether you like it or not this is not exactly new message in movies see inherit the wind but have no problems recycling old ones particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point smiths own problem delivering this message is that he beats us over the head it like we are reading dogma for dummies book but this is smiths personality and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible or koran etc correctly or if there even is correctly and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany linda fiorentino being chosen voice of god metatron alan rickman prevent the destruction of the universe two fallen angels bartleby ben affleck and angel of death loki matt damon along the way forgotten thirteenth apostle rufus chris rock stripper muse serendipity salma hayek and slacker duo jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith himself come bethanys aid fallen muse azrael jason lee proves be the behindthescenes manipulator for all the chicanery the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and make smiths points and in itself has little dramatic momentum among the supposedly outrageous claims made the is that god is woman jesus was black and the bible was written bunch of racist misogynistic white men of course kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe these ideas himself they are metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie when harvey weinstein asked smith put it into the before cannes smith thought it might give validation protesters claims that the was sacrilegious but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into joke the films humor is uneven some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for fire extinguisher when metatron makes burningbush kind of entrance but many of the films jokes just bomb as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity also some of the jokes can be seen coming from mile away still smith keeps the zingers coming at sufficiently rapid pace among the actors fiorentino and rickman stand out far fiorentino virtually herself gives the emotional weight damon and affleck are fairly lackluster rock and hayek exist in the pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob who recur in all of smiths movies are much more in line smiths brand of humor bud cort george carlin janeane garofalo guinevere turner and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances,1.0
