star wars episode phantom menace director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime min us distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright nathaniel atcheson fellow critic once stated belief reviewer should speak himself own review attempted obey rule recent months do so would impossible case fact nearly every person goes see phantom menace brings baggage them original star wars trilogy means so much so many people me they calibrated my creativity child they masterful original works art mix moving stories what were astonishing special effects time they still hold up pretty darn well am too young seen star wars theater during its original release does make me any less dedicated contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular three items very short list why love movies when heard george lucas would making first trilogy ninefilm series got exited when first saw screenshots well over year ago embarked yearlong drool anticipation when first previews were released last thanksgiving ready see then there hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilms secretive snobbery over picture last weeks before picture opened while multitudes fans waited outside theaters stood boiling sun days advance just first ones theater tired hearing about tired seeing cardboard cutouts characters whenever went kfc or taco bell just wanted see reader do misunderstand did antihype reaction hype unavoidable understand accept hype just what happens when prequel most widely beloved films all time get released five minutes into phantom menace knew there problem these jedi knights asked why they churning out stale dialogue machinegun rapidity why these characters being developed before their adventures why there special effects shot nearly every frame entire these were just some my questions early later asked where magic first three films why am looking my watch every fifteen minutes end tired maddened depressed george lucas has funneled own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster phantom menace no star wars take away title jedi talk force left what easily most vacuous special effects movies all time embarrassment looked desperately scene which character explored or new theme examined or special effects shot used there few each they all token attempts fact george lucas has created what simultaneously abysmally bad excuse pretty good showcase digital effects what wanted see did want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste my mouth did story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor scarcely has line their attempts liberate people planet naboo naboo victim bureaucratic war trade federation their contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman teenage ruler truly cares her people after picking up jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best they head tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd mother pernilla august quigon knows force strong young anakin so jedi knights take boy them their journeys bad guys darth maul darth sidious neither whom enough lines register characters there anything particularly wrong story when looking synopsis form way lucas has handled however unsatisfactory first all we do learn single thing about quigon jinn thing what life like before well imagine did why feels like plot device probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless role why recently retired do blame him honestly obiwan character really looking forward learning more about even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines so anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere since these two men focus phantom menace lucas has served us big emotional void centerpiece things start pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps only truly fleshedout character lloyd does thoughtful job role also hugely impressed sand speeder scene rarely action sequence so fast so exciting when anakin says goodbye mother found moving also fairly good portman she manages give little depth character where no depth has been written jar jar binks most annoying characters ever had endure more interesting than most humans soon relativelybrief segment tatooine over back mindnumbing special effects depthless action scenes seen many movies qualify special effects extravaganzas phantom menace first seen had me sick special effects fifteen minutes into reason obvious george lucas has no restraint cannot say did find effects original because did final battle between darth maul obiwan quigon visually exceptional most also found effects deadening tiresome my breaking point near end picture anakin getting questioned yoda other jedi masters background we see hundreds digital spaceships flying around through digital sky wanted go away cannot we stinking scene bursting seems special effects shot got so sick looking cgi characters spaceships planets backgrounds really just wanted go outside look physical landscape few hours then there question magic what lost sixteen years between phantom menace return jedi feeling lucas so focused how looked forgot entirely way should feel john williams familiar score no help nor lucas direction think comes right down characters there none here longed magnetic presence han luke leia got no such thing what about ridiculous expectations mine were high simply wanted showed me roots films grew up loving story had few characters few great special effects instead got two hours fifteen minutes lifeless imaginative computer graphics show do hate phantom menace much resent would like forget exists yet cannot here stay can only hope episodes ii iii something substance them because if they do then lucas will pulled off impossible task destroying own indestructible series,0.0,1.0

pageturner spillane probably most infamous often reviled all mystery writers starts off bang howler opening credits sequence cheap steal james bond series complete cheesy graphics overbearing jazz score bill conti rocky after book begin same murder jack williams frederick downs onearmed detective hammers best friend hammer declares will seek vengeance jacks death help devoted secretary blond shapely velda laurene landon alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino immediately killers trail here splits completely book dives into convoluted improbable tale government conspiracy mind control tactics involving mafia cia hammers vietnam vet buddies kinky sex clinic many same characters book appear they take slightly different roles instance charles kalecki alan king numbers runner narcotics dealer book turns into suave mob boss more importantly hammers suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs runofthemill psychiatrist into coordinator founder sex clinic jury several cinematic renditions spillanes books including version which made differs those earlier versions major way includes all sex violence spillane wrote about could never given screen treatment due hollywoods production code although takes version jury closer core original subject matter aspect received most criticism because took new license extremes many argued surpassed what book rest assured only includes great deal nudity thoroughly violent especially toward women features woman having her neck slashed set twins forced strip before being stabbed death psychotic sexual deviant programmed cia judson scott another woman shot pointblank belly hammer himself no would deny spillanes writing has definite misogynistic nature seems take step further giving such glorious screen treatment its constant equation sex violence much which played intention being erotic quite unsettling no surprise like book fades black dead woman floor jury had troubled production wellsupported studio made which explanation why did do well theaters many people forgotten ever made script written larry cohen best known creatively cheesy nonetheless effective monster movies like alive its two sequels stuff cohen wrote script thinking going helm project well yanked directors chair after only weeks worth shooting because already over budget quickly replaced richard heffron has worked last three decades handful undistinguished movies dozens television projects heffron obviously brought talent because could make rapidly efficiently shows final product cohen had personal interest updated version hammer heffron has none shot quickly clumsily although some scenes ring true most them flat trite invariably dull features numerous car chases shootouts stunts heffrons background television dominant tone despite graphic violence fullfrontal nudity jury takes air madefortv quickie no real punch or depth problems jury run deeper than technical central fault updating mike hammer whose character lost shuffle while updating fifties eighties because spillane wrote all hammer mysteries first person hammers character central tale because all events filtered through persona we never really get impression there no firstperson voiceover narration some scenes do hammer them all consequently great deal texture spillanes storytelling lost period updating turns out detrimentally bad idea because much hammers moral code thrown wind despite characterization hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently own moral code title itself jury refers antiestablishment notion being own law unlike private eyes seek out bad guys then turn them over police hammer both pursues criminal exacts punishment way can seen above law still adheres strictly her own personal code conduct own morality forgoes aspect character hammer comes off only amoral societys terms any terms especially own if anything hammer always had professionalism does away first three minutes showing him rolling sack wife client had paid him find out if wife being unfaithful maybe scene intended laughs only cheapens hammers character all accounts lousy way start blame hammers character cannot laid assantes shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling delivers fine performance spillane never once described hammers physical attributes any dozen books which appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him course because lack written description those read spillanes books will strong personal notion what hammer looks like therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short expectations spillane played character himself girl hunters generally considered best hammers rest actors most unnoteworthy exceptions alan king paul sorvino everyone appeared jury were upandcomers basically went nowhere many them ended up working television like carrera had short stint dallas mideighties which only adds madefortv atmosphere maybe someday someone will manage get right elements together make effective rendition spillane book certainly,0.0,1.0
