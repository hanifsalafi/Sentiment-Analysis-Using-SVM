biggest cliches any serial killer also most believable know where detective looks wall pictures other police information suddenly spots clue which reveals killer sure been used over over some reason always fun watch cliche pretty much describes level kiss girls works overused always fun my personal rules about watching how original how goes around giving its story rule applies highly kiss girls there something psychologically stimulating wellcrafted serial killer kiss girls certainly well made however whole screams unoriginality so relies power its actors technical detail pull through well only actors capable pulling through they add so much nearly every flaw covered up unfortunately most revealing rather insulting choices filmmakers seven lot like knew make put name killer opening credits may give actor credit role throughout hidden my mind waiting him appear screen which spoiled mystery however credit must given director suspending knowledge through most plotwise kiss girls shows almost no originality we introduced detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist immediately we given cliched scene establishing him hero gets call about woman has shot her husband now threatening kill herself obviously cross succeeds getting gun scene quickly forgotten during next scene house cross told neice naomi gina ravera has been missing four days provides motivation cross find killer we never given chance establish relationship between two result we cannot sympathize detective cross however what makes kiss girls slightly original introduction abductees before she abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd actress judd family smart athletic woman because these traits becomes target casanovawhat serial killer likes call himself because these characterdeveloping scenes we care mctiernan making abduction scene all more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes up finds herself cell somewhere woods remembering killer gave her certain rules she decides break them calling out when casanova comes punish her she breaks out escapes jumping over waterfall after she found she begins help cross find neice moment kiss girls takes form every other serial killer two leads search rest victims held captive many people will compare seven another killer starring morgan freeman presume similarities intentional screenplay david klass adapted novel written james patterson yet do quite see how story could worked novel form what makes kiss girls so good acting technical visual impressiveness cinematography aaron schneider reminiscient seven sometimes felt many shots were trying too hard impress us sometimes simple shot best however many shots stunning unlike seven most them take place during day sunlight scene when ashley judd running through forest extremely well done more than way camera work terrific editing makes scene work so well chaotic mtvtype cutting gives audience sense confusion unawareness exactly what judds character experiencing however best aspect kiss girls its actors morgan freeman todays most powerful believable actors detective cross very good character him although just similar character seven because freemans powerful presence carries half himself other half carried ashley judd todays most promising dramatic actresses fact her performance better than freemans if even possible her character more original than freemans she handles wonderfully we finally female character like does more than just scream supporting cast highly underdeveloped cast members do much they can cary elwes portrays cop north carolina unfortunately has scraps character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better we do really get know character either gina ravera gives good performance again she many scenes so result all these small supporting parts weight lies two leads they do phenomenal job some best acting genre some best acting year two other essential aspects quite good director gary fleder does good job controlling actors second half loses believability especially during revelation killer also does handle suspenseful scenes better director would losing lot tension during many scenes however credit does manage terrific first half part blame falls david klass am sure book developed many lesser characters more klass focuses two main parts while may give two leads more screentime many small characters onedimensional killer when revealed extremely implausible thanks smart dialogue adapted novel kiss girls always seems intelligent none conversations laughable all move plot forward without seeming forced biggest problems had motive killer blame mainly casting director because killers motive because rejection women or so assume opening monologue killer himself very attractive my friends shall we say big admirer killer kiss girls rated terror violence language suggested sex all implausibilities mediocre second half kiss girls somehow manages thoroughly entertain fact had urge see again just performances cinematography adds lot mood already creepy tone script usually smart clearly those movies which rely acting pull through morgan freeman possibly todays most convincing actor ashley judd adds another notch her acting belt must also say loved ending showdown between good evil quite tense resolution scene makes almost anyone cheer perhaps may possible most anyway,1.0,0.0

let me open confession love cop movies adore them such unwavering near foolish passion actually first line see tough cop starring smirkiest baldwin brothers steven any good well just about good baldwins steven seagal impression those confused answer resounding no now let me clarify do love just any cop am too keen smug buddy cop flicks were so vogue now slowly gulp returning thanks jackie chan chris tucker am partial those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco french connection problem these films come along just about often george bush makes cogent point so whenever true cop does hit multiplexes come running towards like eager puppy inevitably leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what about cop movies transform me into moron willing shell out called tough cop which actually sounds lot like wiseguy spinoff no truth am sucker those barren streets gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk cops like modern day knights must shield us their iniquitous clutches yes all very corny awfully boys clubish which am guessing precisely where these feelings come little tots us boys brought up create our own wars gi joes enact cops robbers or cowboy indian fantasies etc best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies heighten them turning all into existential nightmare thin moral lines psychological chaos adult my tastes changed all drastically sure can get cerebral high emotional complexities krzysztof kieslowski still delight promise guy could potentially bring now what if cops whore corrupt ones ooh really gets me going these protectors using all their service taking advantage others their own gain throw courtroom drama yech into pot tremendously absorbing sidney lumet prince city how absorbing prince city ask so damn absorbing when shifts gritty undercover cop drama courtroom drama subgenre loath way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar remained completely utterly involved stars treat williams gives kind performance should skyrocketed career up level brad pitt currently resides since hatched mere two years prior release prince city cannot provide answer why did though judging recent roles tripe like deep rising dead heat would guess probably has something do quite few bad career moves like mickey rourke eric roberts both whom currently doing time direct video purgatory williams talented leading man did make where should if there any justice dog gone world keanu reeves would banished direct video hell here actor given role all dissimilar al pacinos serpico also directed lumet williams plays danny ciello member elite squad police officers take down drug dealers gritty prejuliani streets new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes analogy more than apt seeing how bunch kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means get job done squad relies entirely informants low level junkies gain access big wigs order obtain info they seek they sometimes provide junkies junk their choice danny has done though fairly honorable guy took job order do good intentions gotten bit skewed along way seeks redemption concludes best way go about getting talking internal affairs then convince him go undercover double agent does so condition will rat partners right away we know exactly what will do watching build thrilling way any great character driven story can undercover cop films almost innately exciting even kind pull out all cliches like too deep how can moved issues betrayal ambiguity danger putting oneself such risky position prince city takes all charges perceptive hard boiled script taut unintrusive direction old pro sidney lumet well handful intense performances most notably treat lumets greatest contribution how lays back lets camera soak up action scenes transition rapidly next building layers tension rarely holds reaction shots instead clicks away precisely moment character stops yakking lumets worst tendency many makers especially oliver stone tend overuse relies little too heavily actors shouting their lines each other presumably order ratchet up tension much problem here night falls manhattan lumets most recent cop lawyer endeavor nearly gave me ulcer just watching though late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe treat should get together drink or something most recent completely unnecessary remake gloria here sustaining tension runs minutes dull spot some formula pictures like best most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy make these kinds pictures even tolerable course cop movies popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks popular those more like extended sitcoms gunfire amid punch lines just look average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated full unnecessary fat like boring love interest serves no purpose other than stall action demonstrate our hero gay lame comic relief character never funny all its moral ambiguities prince city back basics cop courtroom drama leaves out all crap really thrills focuses completely its story its characters all whom completely believable cops lawyers junkies there great scene early where irate williams shouts ia officer looks if about go into those corny braveheart inspirational speeches instead breaks down front cop begins sobbing scene would never make into michael bay even though bruce willis sacrifices life end armageddon damn tear would cut out because director would say oh makes him too human excuse me weak very next scene danny speaks hushed raspiness straining get words out lost voice does little itty bitty detail matter maybe most sure made my night sprawling epic corruption greed betrayal violence nice see someone paying attention little things,1.0,0.0
