there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early two of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween the same god am scared there is some guy in mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenters classic jamie lee copies here none of the urgency or suspense terror train takes place on where else train charted some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education most of them will not make it med school though and it is obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains wish hell they would put radio on that train the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee from the beginning he is talking his head off he tells one of his coworkers think on this when is the last time someone built shopping mall next train station as if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles of course the loudmouth conductor is the first person find bloody body is then gone when he brings skeptical trainman back view it forgot mention the prologue it is party three years earlier the same group of students two of them play trick on geeky frat pledge promising him he is going get laid they send jamie lee up stand behind the bed and talk the geek as he comes in noticing form on the bed she says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed happens be cadaver oh my god they killed kenny you bastards it is sick trick and one jamie lee was not let in on she still has not forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you cannot have good time without hurting somebody the killing starts before the train even leaves the station since it is new years everyones wearing disguises convenient plot device we have seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking at least one of the characters says it is groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who the way would make great killer in slasher movie speaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard illusions set disco music then there is his greatest trick getting laid hair that looks like that for all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching only diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt watch it and it makes me wonder if horror movie set in an rv could be much worse mean when was the last time someone built shopping mall next train station anyway terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of sleeper car,0.0
according hitchcock and various other filmmakers isolated motels diners gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers at the beginning of eye of the storm german american thriller directed yuri zeltser one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up ten years later their son steven played bradley gregg who was blinded during the incident still runs motel together his older brother ray played craig sheffer hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone played dennis hopper gets stranded there his attractive wife sandra played lara flynn boyle their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed yuri zeltser author of this was obviously inspired hitchcocks psycho but he chose add some new and potentially interesting elements the original plot instead of norman bates we have two brothers one of them traumatised physically another mentally sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened the presence of alcoholic husband eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense photography karl walter lindenlaub providing lot of claustrophobic atmosphere the acting is fine hopper gregg and boyle are comfortable their roles but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine unfortunately eye of the storm was supposed be intense psychological drama deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale in the end this reminds us that original approach cannot prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities special note the profiler fans ally walker appears in the beginning of the in the small role of killers girlfriend,0.0
if you have been following william fichtners career and there is absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that he is played some rather similar roles over the years like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and little bit scary or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of dannyhere is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hardhitting roles is why his performance in what is the worst that could happen is such shock such delight in the fichtner plays blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dogloving detective as alex tardio fichtners performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it it borders on offensive but does not really manage it and it borders on clich stereotype but does not quite succumb that definition either in role so diametrically opposed what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner is not perfectyou can see him struggling little at times concentrating little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles coiffed canine up close and personalbut he is pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the in fact had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter would have walked out for what is the worst that could happen is mesmerizing in its awfulness poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible moviegoing experience fichtners performance does not exactly save the and it is not like am recommending what is the worst that could happen solely on the strength of the actors dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the films rating from no stars oneandahalf thumbs up fichtner then and thumbs downway way downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it does not even warrant discussion,0.0
note some may consider portions of the following text be spoilers be forewarned it is rather easy start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature dream the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie is rarely as funny as it aspires be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives be in the films latter half the films central characters are terry david arquette depressed lonely voyeur who claims be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt carefree young street tough later revealed be terminally ill nick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terrys wristwatch and eventually cons terry into trade the watch for bottle of pills of course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out find nick in order retrieve his watch learning of nicks condition he only has handful of weeks left terrys compassion kicks in and the two eventually come distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terrys death wish killing him this is promising premise and mr taylors could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is repessed mournful character who wants die while nick is free spirit joie de vivre who is dying but wants live and takes the easy route out turning dream the fishes into typical lark where the two characters engage in series of generally dull exploits and where the straightlaced character learns enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up quirky character this is bythenumbers plotting buddy movieroad movie redux however dream the fishes is most hampered not its uninspired storyline but the characters carry the story it helps in such have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little sympathise their respective plights and even less reason want follow their onscreen exploits far from romp this fatal flaw makes dream fishes more like chore endure than playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the as the two men begin bond mr taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream the fishes while attempting capture quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that is provocative leaves room for further questions the enjoys few inspired moments the urn scene session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes this occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital am realising that this is intended be funny although nary smile crept upon my lips is probably due the obvious fact that it is painfully clear the audience from the outset that terry is going be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him this is not has the wherewithal kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition attempts at humour terribly diminished utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering freshfaced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming sharks who gets apply his adeptness for timidity as terry mr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the set in an urban environment have been processed appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes the charge of dream the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is bit of an odd one coming from me seem have predilection for films unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have been in the minority supporting films have been condemned as interminable due the difficult audienceunfriendly nature of their characters for dream the fishes though did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die,0.0
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose highly personal family drama about violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing raymond then proceed beat and bite him bloody wreck but these are the least of billys problems billy is heroin addict on the downturn and it does not seem that he will last much longer billy and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak have not told the half of it this is not cheery movie and most of the time it is downright depressing while at times it is interesting watch see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end it is not quite worth it there are too many scenes randomly dot the picture little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends stray puppy the is filled these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the but their expression seems be more of catharsis for the creator than us the actors do fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how write good scenes and the actors in nil mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there is no one restrain oldman from making poor choices good character drama should mean something those involved in making the and the audience oldman got it about half right,0.0
my first exposure the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first gain national theatrical release did not see the first until much later so looking back the original did not hold lot of great memories for me since did not think too much of it when initially saw it watching it now for second time confirmed that it is an overrated horror that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever you all know the story now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before this first installment does an adequate job it is low budget but there is some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems the story plus the movies ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the have hook for sequel renders the rest of the pointless and does anyone understand what happens nancys mother at the end of this do not get me wrong though it is not as if new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics most horror movies released today are just as inane as this is horror is difficult genre pull off credibly and nightmare on elm street just does not cut it nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video it is available both as single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set the is presented in both pan and scan and it is original theatrical aspect ratio of although on the disc that comes in the box set only widescreen transfer is provided the has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio mono mix and new dolby digital mix also included on the dvd is fulllength audio commentary track writerdirector wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the films director of photography other extras include the jump nightmare feature am sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios are from the films original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the films original theatrical trailer some dvdrom features are also included but since do not have dvdrom capabilities cannot really get into that the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular the first thing of note is that it is the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from few years ago am not saying that is negative thing just pointing it out everyone seems enthusiastic about being there the possible exception of john saxon who just does not say much at all most of the time you will forget he is even there everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because they are commenting on scary movie that they need stay as quiet as possible the bonus disc the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about minutes worth of interviews relating the first of the series also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings the however you can only access one easily the other is hidden in what is called the labyrinth might possibly be the most annoying feature of dvd ever created basically it is an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects give you access extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending the finding it though is both chore and bore r,0.0
in tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into huge box office hit an atmospheric little that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between noir and the godfather was it deep nope however it was perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures was true if what you were looking for was the tale of heroic mans escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it and wrote that this is batman as batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year the praise was deserved from start finish the was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there was no doubt that there would be sequel directed burton the result was batman returns forgets that it wants be fun within the first five minutes the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin bite off batmans nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman slither over batmans body she gets pushed off building admire mr burton for trying do more then entertain but the result is mess nothing works out as planned it fails both entertain and enlighten hints are made the audience that this could be blast alas these are only hints there are do not misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped the penguin within giant cage small basket is dropped into large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable make the work on any regular basis weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but often dissapointing,0.0
and thought stigmata would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year turns out was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and selfimportant end of days is completely inept on all fronts it is silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it is extremely disconcerting see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin does not count is no fun at all end of days is major stinker the movie opens in vatican city some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy says that girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought be killed in new york that very night girl is born fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal excop drinking problem now working as security guard for hire he is protecting local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman crazed former priest leads him the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking kill her there are so many problems this it is hard know where begin but how about starting the concept casting arnold in role like this was mistake begin schwarzenegger is persona not an actor so putting him in role that contradicts his usual strong personality is bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability pull off character tormented conflicting emotions in other words trying give him dimension was mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they have all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt establish jerichos character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in the devil tries tempt him into revealing christines location offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie is not up the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one is not at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness he is suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as powerful villain byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrnes speech about the bible being overrated actually starts make sense mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries liven things up some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney is not given much do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting do performances aside it would be really hard enjoy this no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it is no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it is utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new years eve because it is exactly years after the year of the devil is not it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add the beginning and you have got if you do not buy this explanation you are not alone it is convoluted and silly at the same time the method jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she is christine see and she lives in new york see and if that were not bad enough there is plenty of bothersome stuff in this that is not explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes snuffing out one drunk excop he is powerless is he impervious only one kind of bullet how come he cannot control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal time zones in their prophecies clumsy attempt at joke is made about this but it is never actually explained usually this sort of thing would not matter in schwarzenegger flick mean do not get me started on the time paradoxes offered up the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror clich present in end of days complete the old black cat hiding in cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that it is possible for those uninterested in being scared close their eyes at the precise moment boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we do not care about these characters due the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too do not make any sense there is scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady it is good for few chuckles but not much else supposedly we are believe she now has super strength virtue of being controlled satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it is often hard tell why it is happening in the first place not mention that they are edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but it is also distinctly unpleasant watch the devil apparently does not operate in the more subtle willconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this does not only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not single scene in end of days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed be shocking it is not good idea throw so much of it into movie that the audience goes numb scenes are not connected through any reasonable means so lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and had no idea why reasons hell reasons let us just blow stuff up is not it cool nope not long shot this is thoroughly unwatchable it is dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs make some movies james cameron revive his career because it is not happening hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it did not top itself off an overly pious ending that nobodys going buy if the movie is going be serious the filmmakers should have come up decent script if it is going be campy arnold should not be taking himself so damn seriously did not actually see him put up on cross did and his character should not be such sad sack as it stands end of days is just bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that,0.0
stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime is not funny business homer yen on particular night when found myself having some free time had chance either go sleep early or see mafia spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino at minutes in length thought that could enjoy few laughs before getting good nights sleep but my account think that my laffometer only registered few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle suppose that you could justify your time as homage the venerable star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this mafia chronicles vincenzo cortinos lloyd bridges life separated from his family when he was young he escapes america and tries live an honest life but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up be powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women mafia is cowritten jim abrahams who also contributed some gutbusting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of manic silliness at work as write this also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on this spoof is based crime movies in general contain lot of profanity and violence it is tough genre parody was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide sector take over but this opportunity was never explored there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing his newly wed daughterinlaw gunman shoots him several times the impact of the bullets cause him make these wild contortions that force the wedding band change music styles keep up him from the samba disco the macarena think that just gave away the best part of the oh well that just means that you can go sleep little earlier,0.0
die hard is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the films pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving dozen planes stranded in the air waiting land the has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cutouts so much for the script how about the action well let us put it this way director renny harlin could learn few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for red october and predatorall standouts for their hairraising suspense contrast harlin does not have clue when it comes choreographing action and consequently die hard never picks up steam die harder is impossible take seriously even for minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it is good you do laugh but you laugh at the not it die hard should have never been cleared for takeoff,0.0
i admit it thought arnold schwarzenegger had knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies watching him in jingle all the way wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such lame movie targeted at susceptible kids it was one thing scare the crap out of kids the pg kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation and you know they will burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santas elves he later decks reindeer hey man why do not you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you are at it jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought arnold sinbad and phil hartman crash the ground more times in this movie than special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability each successive scene what can you expect from movie whose entire premise is that two parents cannot find rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything get one arnold is of course one of the parents crack salesman who is never there for his son he races from the office his sons karate game only find out he missed it and his kid distrusts him because he is never around gee we have not seen that in movie before arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way buy back his sons affection is get him turboman doll his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him get weeks ago so arnold sets out find turboman turns out be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out let me back up for minute here arnolds kid is totally obsessed this turboman character is unhealthy beyond belief watches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets would try discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think it is wonderful thing con your dad into racing out buy you any toy you want but nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who do not recognize him until the last minute this is sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through store racing off the mall and hooking up santa jim belushi who runs bootleg toy factory most painful watch is scene at radio station where sinbad holds off the cops letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away turboman doll capitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful never mind the subplot perfect neighbor phil hartman trying seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible it is the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it is okay do whatever it takes get your hands on what you want maybe that is what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine,0.0
when the haunting arrived in theaters all kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in horror are far scarier than those that you can put face courtesy of special effects while agree that this remake of the haunting goes bit overboard in the visual effects department do not think that they are completely blame for this movies failure it appears that some people have failed take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as dust bunny so special effects or not if the story is not the least bit scary you are not going end up very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie as sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects kept wishing that this movie was about derns caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never good sign when bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson plays scientist who is conducting experiments on fear he decides the best way get results is trick group of fairly unstable individuals spend few days in haunted mansion he tricks them into participating letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails mention that the mansion has reputation for strange goingson catherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylors character is the star of the movie but since she does not quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zetajones their parts did seem be big larger than in the original and let us face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones will admit that would have never seen this thing if she were not in it but the real stars here is the special effects combined the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start interact our hapless insomnia patients there really is not much of story here just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got play and the special effects are great in many cases they are as good as you are likely see anywhere in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when first saw the house was very impressed the very cool gothic look about it but it only took short tour the characters around the place see that the set designers obviously had as much money burn as the visual effects people did and decided take the idiotically overdone route this included flooded hallway books as stepping stones and mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play in the story absolutely none they were just there take our minds off the fact that there was neither descent story nor single scare in the entire movie then we have the actors lili taylor has never been one of my favorites and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him have no doubt that liam will want lock all prints of this movie in very secure vault along all copies of darkman zetajones was cast because she is too hot for words the fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake all catherine has do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she does very well while she does have fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eyecandy it is too bad someone of her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant horror if the story sucks it is all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars if it is scares you want rent halloween either way it is probably in your best interests skip the haunting,0.0

i am steven seagal fan only say this now because mufti splenetik is not my real name and because probably need explain why went into this expecting great things any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies extemely crunchable bones we will always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing rarely female colead in sight unless it is reallife modelwife who has not worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine not mention very straightforward plots generally allround bad dialogue and mr implacable leatherface himself in that same black outfit he is been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull in the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets sidekick attempts banter and puts on new vest he is also put on quite lot of weight small potatoes you may say man should be able accessorize and banter if he wants but damnit if it as not broke why fix it more on this disappointed persons dashed expectations later as jack cole seagal is homicide detective questionable past while he and his partner played keenen ivory wayans are investigating series of ritual killings cole himself becomes suspect especially when background check run campbell reveals practically nothing on cole it turns out that cole is former trained government assassin you just cannot trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used catch just glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads the gradual uncovering of larger more threatening conspiracy that involves crooked businessman bob gunton coles former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg seen it is the other changes that disappoint for example although there is fair amount of violence in this movie there is also the disastrous pairing of seagal keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from televisions in living colour wayans plays whiney straightman seagals beadadorned and brocadedraped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue wasted zest as campbell wayans confines himself bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching cook in under seige seagal is now buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble he chants refuses fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell powdered deer penis cure his allergies again benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal speak more than usual heck he has deliver punchlines and carry steady conversation someone other than himself for large part of the is that lot ask of the seague too much seagals best characteristic used be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and do it silently and alone not for seagal the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts show that he can act much less think no kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows that is really how it must have started likeminded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have see him do anything else we trusted him we got know him now betrayal do not know if can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he is going try be funny again will try but it will not be easy if you have not watched the glimmer man yet you might want wait for the video come out it is easier just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences after all if we cannot depend on our fantasies what can we depend on the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice mufti spelenetik is still steven seagal fan everybody makes mistakes once in awhile,0.0
the th warrior comes at the end of as summer where we have already experienced man eating sharks deep blue sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even man hunting witch the blair witch project now the th warrior presents tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears the story if that is what you want call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love his kings wife and is banished from his home land he then travels the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador them eventually the vikings are called upon protect the people of the village who are being hunted the flesh eating men thirteen warriors are chosen go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth he is not warrior and at first not well accepted the vikings but as the movie advances he will have prove himself both on and off the battlefield that is basically the entire plot there is also romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin wonder why the filmmakers did not just edit out all of the scenes attaining that part of the story instead they chose leave just enough of those scenes in annoy the viewer the is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries develop story it becomes laughing stock the battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting we do not get know any of the characters and so we do not care who lives and who dies the wants be beowolf comes across more as failed actionadventure story aspiring epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels it was directed john mctiernan who is the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently and it is not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long the studio just waiting for time dump it on audiences it belongs back on the shelf,0.0
when watch movie like mike nichols what planet are you from cannot help but feel like everyone is looking at me it is as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness eyes shooting daggers quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money spend their time watching this this thing shift uncomfortably in my seat am reminded of how feel when see pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in teleprompted funny conversation introduce the next blockbuster award it is not my fault know it is not my fault but dammit someones gotta be embarrassed because it does not look like anyone on the screen is ready take the blame am about give you list of names of people who are gonna make movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these names make you instantly shudder the answer would have come up before today is no this is quite list of talented individuals we have got here granted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like smile like yours but even so they have got proven power as excellent supporting players garry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little it is garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show and for gods sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purports be comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon but what this movie winds up being is collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled uninsightful cringeinducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringeinducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling plays an alien from planet populated technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course his leaders put select group of males through series of tests designed determine one is most fit fly off earth find female of the species and impregnate her they are taught how pretend that they are listening nodding and saying uhhuh and how compliment shoes imagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out fail miserably producing comedic results the lucky winner is fitted penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such scenario since the population has stopped evolving due the fact that they are all just clones whoops too late the penis when aroused tends make humming noise the writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend turn this as source of comedy it is not funny the first time it is not funny the eighth time it is not funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely selfconscious garry meets up coworker at bank played greg kinnear who turns out be generic unlikable scumbag he is meant fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character but he is so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside kinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own worm his way into vice presidents position and goes aa meetings pick up chicks wow what magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball when kinnears wife walks into the office there is not single guy who does not trip bump into wall or otherwise pratfall as if they would never seen woman before the few guys that are not particularly slimeballs such as john goodmans detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics shandling meets up annette bening who will inevitably prove be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnears aa meetings shandlings mission is have baby and when he reveals his desires her bening instantly falls for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turns out she wants baby too benings character perhaps was the most difficult watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed be representing the female of the species as whole then woe say the species she is unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic there is point where after thinking she may not be able bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song deliver the news and then says him now you cannot leave me we are supposed empathize shandlings discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead wanted weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of great big nothing and eventually shandling falls in love her for real suppose though am not sure exactly what prompted it what is the message derive from all this men are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha am thankful such broad cynicism is not frequently allowed run so rampant let us all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one there is also subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity goodman through series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is being from another world magic vibrating penis it has all the makings for subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for while withers and falls away further proof that goodman should just stick doing coen brothers movies but let us not dwell on this any longer have already wasted plenty of your time and my own let us move on forget about what we have seen here and get on our lives and help us out let us end things on happy note congratuations go out annette bening winner of this weeks title award for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies

bats is this years camp flick the worlds worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well would say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and you will spare yourself minutes of your life and bucks boot love alfred hitchcocks the birds almost as much as love the short story on it is based it saddens me even more then see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly wannabe horrorschlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in small texas town the authorities call in batologist dina meyer investigate it turns out that creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently scientists job make things little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have kill all the bats and save the world of course that cannot happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in professionally produced motion picture consider for example scene where two people are in bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for while transfixed the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we do not even get see what is going on the screen becomes mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains mystery little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries liven things up some intentional humor but it is so conventional it does not really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologists wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity sputter ingenious lines like hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on double quality they may inspire smirk their very nature and roaring laugh because they are so inept hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oneliners playing such characters does not help actors careers still suppose that if you are looking for movie that is so bad it is good you could do worse than bats it does have tremendous amount of camp value am not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and know that this might convince some people go out and see it more power them,0.0
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the classic term that use very loosely define the original about really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects give it kind of nostalgic campy feel the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the does not exactly hurt it either fast forward the late steve mcqueen is not in the remake this might have something do the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years nor is there any heavy hitters in the lead role that is unless you count matt dillons brother kevin as heavy hitter the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original the only things you need now have great special effects in movie are deep pockets it looks as if the produces of the new blob had couple of holes in their pockets the special effects in this movie are cheesy like the originals unlike the original they do not look campy they just look cheap one bright spot in the movie from purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith she is very attractive and can actually act is more than can say about some of her costars in terms of plot little ball of pink goop falls from the sky seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on satellite anyway the pink stuff has taste for humans the more people it absorbs the bigger it gets and it is not the friendliest goop on the block either anyway it attacks this little town and it is up the attractive local teenage population stop it not really but that is how it seems this version attempts recapture the camp of the original as have already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy in the years since this was made none of the cast have gone on greatness although star shawnee smith had very tiny role in armageddon the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud although some of the films smaller roles are filled some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows it also appears that the producers of the blob tried compensate for the lack of special effects budget making the scenes in the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible sadly it does not work very well if you want see big ball of goop terrorize town then would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original although that is not so hot either this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities,0.0

written alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed terry gilliam have always preferred mushrooms blotter acid dropping acid is like riding roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then there is the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come ingesting strychninelaced dose mushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of leisurely ride on ferris wheel steady reassuring assent short period of thrilling motion and color and then smooth landing acid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when wish he would have made mushroom movie full of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the certainly offers something for those fans of hunter thompsons book who want experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out but for those of us who just want enjoy wellmade gilliam has produced mixed bag fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed gonzo journalist hunter thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came las vegas cover motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available man of means in operating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in hotel suite binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked horrifying lizards in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke throw the tape player into the bathtub him just as jefferson airplanes white rabbit reaches its climax and these guys do not just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompsons book besides being hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came die pontificate all you want about how the illustrates thompsons message but the truth is that stripped its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is drug comedy it is cheech and chong movie you are there watch depp and del toro ingest lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down there is nothing wrong this concept but gilliam tries too hard this is frantic movie all sweaty closeups wideangle lenses dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes there are times when gilliam really does put convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but what end much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book and there are some priceless comic observations but you are hard pressed hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings us the performances strike me as all wrong depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george scott in patton gimmicky performance works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue in between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something see it is interesting note that alex cox credited as cowriter on the screenplay was originally slated direct before gilliam took over as much of fan as am of gilliams work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy coxs best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen carry the gilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie was he trying make anyway it does not try be cautionary tale and it does not work as broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been much more interesting but do not want be too hard on it there are some truly funny moments and if you are in good enough mood you might get kick out of it do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance guarantee it will enhance the effect,0.0
the best thing about lake placid is that it is only minutes long and when it is over you are glad that you did not waste more than an hour and half of your time it is nothing more than bad ripoff of jaws and think that is being kind it was written david kelly ally mcbeal as horrorcomedy but fails at both miserably was never scared and think that only laughed once the crocodile even fails in comparison the snake in anaconda the plot begins when man is eaten in half the giant crocodile in black lake in maine that brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and fishandgame warden bill pulman investigate also paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent look at tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants swim beside the beast soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want kill the croc and the other half want save it there is also an eccentric old lady betty white who lives the lake and has few secrets as mentioned before kelley and director steve minor do not go for serious approach towards the material but they also do not have anything sly or satirical or witty say either the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting they are all basically idiots if they had any brains the croc would not have been that much of challenge catch and they would not have put themselves in half of the situations that they did but then again if they were smart there would not be movie basically lake placid is best undiscovered,0.0
that is unless you are one of those people who have seen the preview thousand times on tv or in the theaters can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away why someone would want base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me however if they had not given it away the would have still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter obviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and couple of cliches and call it an action drama double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he did not see be on screen half as much as judd did it also offers some genuinely funny clever or fulloftension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the from its insanely predictable plot half the time am wondering whether am watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries always turn out be less exciting than advertised judging the beginning end and huge chunk of the middle might have been watching special hallmark presentation too the movies stretching for an almost two hour long only minutes worth of material implausible material no less loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie thought that is not possible that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries pass itself off as serious drama everything seems dragged out overplayed when they should have kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early,0.0
i had an epiphany today it occurred me while was watching house on haunted hill it is as follows if trailer makes the it is advertising look like trashy stupid movie well guess what chances are there is truth in advertising too bad did not trust my own instincts when somethingortheother possessed me see this movie blame it on my sudden craving for scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow that and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule an hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face wish would seen it when it was halloween at least would have been forgiving hey tis the season the movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the obviously was not going anywhere now truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic that is what spooks people out the fact that it could happen them or someone they know there has be logical precedent for the situations they want scare us sure utterly unpredictable is good too but that is different from utterly nonsensical hohh house on haunted hill on the other hand well let us just say about fell off my chair laughing when they ohsocleverly revealed that everyone who got invited the party was related the psycho doctors who died in the house couple of decades ago riiiiight yknow that just sends chills down my spine yeah just like wet my pants when they told me the house is evil ooooooo hint blood and guts only work few times sooner or later people start tell themselves that it is just ketchup and props and you have got come up something better than that there were just too many things in this movie that we have all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for last scare each was more predictable than the last why did not these fools just stay together in one place anyways sheesh was grossed out yes did get spooked few times yes but why get really disturbed when there is no why when there were not random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect was not that good either trust me and the scare the was filled drab laughable dialogue the characters were incredibly flat and cliched not mention downright annoying you have got bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course they are dumb enough go party some stranger invited them provided they win million dollars if they survive the night jeez thought no one fell for those you may already be winner things anymore and of course all three gals are babes wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie keep that up geoff and you will qualify for the next batman venture the only single person enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up and famke jansen sp because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan pierce brosnan hey willingly endured dantes peak three times for him all right concede there were couple of things enjoyed that perverted little amusement park at the beginning probably will not ride rollercoaster for while and the machine they used drive geoffreys character mad see do not even remember their names the machine not that stupid fishtank naked wimmin in it kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie it would not have redeemed the but at least it would have made me feel better but no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending thank god they did not add kiss at the end or would have puked god there is no hope,0.0

one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets gloria remake of the john cassavetes had absolutely no effect on me occurred when was driving home from the theatre suddenly realized that since had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before had not thought once about the had just invested nearly two hours of my life in when movie is over are not we supposed think about it for while and have conversation about it the acquaintances we have just watched it thought so but for one saw this particular picture myself and even if had been someone there would not have been anything talk about in the first place be sure gloria begins stirring rather poignant prologue in sevenyearold boys family is brutally gunned down mobsters in search of disc his father had incriminating evidence on it right before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc escape eventually the boy named nicky nunez jeanluke figueroa is caught the mobsters and taken back their apartment meanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for crime she did not commit and returns her exboyfriend jeremy northam recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime when he refuses give it her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves him in order save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them strip nude gloria is the type of fasttalking smartmouthed new yorker who always seems get involved the wrong people and she never expected be stuck kid but she has heart of gold do not they always in this type of movie and is only trying protect the boy whom she quickly begins form close bond the previous incarnation of gloria cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen me but was no doubt superior even though cannot really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely the original but the itself is simply lifeless only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it is not completely unbearable watch liked for example very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again these bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the deals the budding relationship between nicky and gloria is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers throughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares as gloria sharon stone has adopted an overthetop brooklyn accent that honestly does not sound realistic at all in the beginning in fact was amazed at how amateurish stones performance was but as the progressed she got better although not one of her better turns stone does have comic flare that refuses be ignored jeanluke figeroa was fine as nicky and little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want gag all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as glorias friend whom she turns for help sony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the and do not blame them they declined screen the picture for critics is never good sign particularly the highprofile people involved although how much money movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams failed even make the top last week have suspicion gloria is going vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night m showing saw it at where there were about ten fifteen people present counting myself although stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in casino or last dance if you do not believe me and sidney lumet can be respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed finance it when they could have been making picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of chance be successful,0.0
prereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex will be forced refer that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review because of this will try vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens be word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not it is most likely just another way of referring sex think we would all agree that any word used incessantly becomes bit monotonous so hope you appreciate my attempt liven up what could potentially be very boring review though not as boring as the movie makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what body shots is so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you would normally expect see violent attack it is about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are things we all do sometimes the characters in this spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it is as if fucking is all they have look forward after busy workweek at its core body shots is message movie the kind of thing could picture really progressive church groups showing middle schoolers in order turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is moralist nothing new say his characters do not communicate anything of interest each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity let out their inner thoughts speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitudes like like come or sex without love equals violence huh and yes that is as complex as this movies observations get the characters are stupid and shallow not one registering as anything more the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events we meet the characters as they speak directly us confiding in us their idiotic ruminations on intimacy would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this cannot am not trying be clever or witty but honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others the exception of trent played ron livingston as bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like headache commercial blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won pulitzer prize completely baffles me this is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims be defining if body shots is meant say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and kobsessed fine do not have any problem that tries persuade me think certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side additionally that one side is not even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter takes place outside club on chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters they suddenly have vigorous intercourse each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen be standing next each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only is not it erotic it is not real it does not feel like an authentic sexual encounter every k scene in this and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along it and most of all it fails show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us several tedious plot lines follow the main concern is much ado over rape that may or may not have occurred the shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off this is topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me cannot think of one that has done so and yes saw the accused may be one of the most overrated movies of the next wall street unfortunately nobody gives us reason care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem have wandered off the set of noxious spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in manner similar what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such decision the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed care about them he gave them heart cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones he preaches us using his characters preach us this is not the way get any message across why not just direct public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and helping of leering exploitation,0.0

meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood screams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they do not actually come together until the final ten fifteen minutes and we are supposed believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while almost bust gut at that truly delusional notion eve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and husband adam arkin and preteen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what assume is alzheimers even though the never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong him while eves relationship her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of ups and downs lou who used be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the selftitled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest soap opera actress interestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them drift apart but they do manage consistently talk on the phone one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long if you are able get through the opening halfhour in phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking sledgehammer them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want subject themselves this resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback how could comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the is not mature enough deal such thing in thoughtful manner and since we learn next nothing about their childhood it is lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced repulsively annoying threeminute scene in they argue like little children you can see the impending death coming mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come terms themselves and each other you think yourself the only thing left for them do is have playful foodfight and like clockwork it also occurs the end credits meg ryan is versatile actress look no further than hurlyburly or when man loves woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies hanging up the only thing she needs do is completely sever her filmmaking ties nora ephron writerdirectorhack who should not be allowed work in again after this bigbudget highprofile debacle even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks christmas when she had heartbreaking runin her mother and halloween when lou crashed her sons birthday party in drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings the situations diane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than director here but that is wildly feeble compliment what is more than little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryans senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in bigscreen venture after her even more thin role in analyze this kudrow is not given enough time create full personality maddy so it is not her fault she does not register until few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is real talent and anxiously await the next time she is given role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work in the opposite of sex if you are fan of kudrows and who is not do yourself favor and rent this gem that puts more good use kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety as eves hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered role that gives him next nothing do until subplot reveals itself midway through only never be mentioned again cloris leachman as ryan and matthau makes small but noticeable impression her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as rosycheeked woman lou had an affair in the christmas flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer care about the characters aside from eve why would you want when they are all spoiled brats if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in movie theater showing this my suggestion would be hang up on it before the opening credits are over saying it is waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions,0.0
under any other circumstances would not be discussing the ending of the extent that will in this particular review however in order fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful minute dissection of the ending is necessary even though will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk the movie opens quite poorly might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon one of malcolms past patients distraught the suicidal man cameo new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself cut the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in while did not want bludgeoned over the head blunt instrument after about minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able communicate the dead and this as they say is where the healing begins the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon twist ending that knew going into the one of roger eberts colleges was kind enough give it away on recent segment of siskel and ebert although was at first enraged that an established critic could so callously ruin for thousands of patrons soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been blessing in disguise have always been sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike that sports one here since knew the major plot twist that was coming at the films conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving bad movie solely because of its ending something have fallen victim in the past was eliminated and indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove be quite an enlightening experiment stripped of the element of surprise the was put the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind shocking conclusion after seeing its true colors came the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power it is neat concept but not one that justifies being made into featurelength movie in fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the develops as sort of prelude the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet come and when the final moments do come it is huge letdown the end makes no sense at all it stupefied me the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on fundamental and very rare level will not go into any details but suffice say that as far as can tell it negates rest of the movie such an extent that anyone who buys it even for second must be suffering from very acute case of attention deficit disorder now in all fairness cannot say for sure that would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed me before hand however feel very confident that as well as anyone who had seen few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming mile away the fact that moviegoers nation wide are surprised the ending still has me stumped ironically fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending little girls funeral the viewer is required be aware of very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome proxy would not have even known about this mental disease if had not pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did feature story on it despite being blessed some really amazing cinematography and brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalkfull of contradictions and just is not plausible enough warrant even slight recommendation,0.0

a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous th century french poets the managed remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it could not build on show them as the poets they were on paper this should not have been so terrible it had talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and capable cast but the was done in its inept script the unappealing way the was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud found his performance be the most risible one in the him acting more like teenage brat than young genius spouting obsenities without giving hint that true poet lies behind that facade he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin character he was forced be but when the two of them were together it looked like mismatch leonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring the opens in postrevolutionary france in the yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine letter his poems he accepts verlaines praises and invitation be house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict verlaines busty yearold wife mathilde romane and finds his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common her when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in haughty tone only if they are bad poets he will continue treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship verlaine proves be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable character as rimbaud when mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in rooming house and the two become lovers it is real downer watch this story unfold into series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets leads them traveling together and mathilde asking for divorce in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes he instead goes north africa and becomes an adventurer and gunrunner and after ten years there comes home tumor on his knee and dies changed man at the age of the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying the ends on whimper verlaine talking rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses the sister wants destroyed so as not embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published this was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this as the only manages skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry have no idea what the filmmaker was trying say in this but whatever it was it just did not work it certainly did not bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry,0.0
in our time in our modern world where the cool rule it is hard imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man and yet after after is based on his everlasting magic in warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeares romeo and juliet its title sequence frightening rap song and black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard associate shakespeares poetry the takes place during silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese the youngest son of chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered the afroamericans are immediately suspected but peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers it is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brothers death escaping from prison in china he returns united states avenge his brothers fate but before he can restore justice his kung fu kicks he falls in love mysterious beauty the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy there is only weak echo of shakespeares talent in this disappointing production and there are more problems besides its title of course we do not call it deformation of great masterpiece we call it modernization it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond lyrics without any car chases and gun fights this lack of respect for the audience find very disturbing kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare does not need be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature and as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare must admit that found rome must die very confusing can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing he manages create an incredible atmosphere and directs firm precision unfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments his latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow the love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified jet li is one of the most amazing fighters ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has magical voice their achievement save this from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act they are nothing more than two celebrities put together the other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances delroy lindo is the only one that projects coherent image of reality but there is more than acting worry about even lis incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing make long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough be thriller not sensual enough be love story and too serious be fun action it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel romeo and juliet so the is completely stuck not sure of what be and in the end it is nothing there are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises so again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement this can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre it is mostly provided aalyahs enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs various artists that create kind of ghetto feel it but when think back it is not much remember from this production as in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that remember are associated massive special effects it is not that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it does not have any for someone who has never read shakespeare it is another popcorn for those of us who has it is waste of money time and brain cells,0.0

idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative if an original thought found its way into this horrorcomedy it would die of loneliness plus you have question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of movie dealing the slaughter of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo the movie is insulting horror fans and teenagers the plot what little there is deals anton devon sawa highschool slacker who is hand goes on murderous rampage after becoming possessed along the way the hand kills antons parents and his two best friends the friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them that is the level of thiss atrocitys humor the movie treats death as joke idle hands is gruesome and morbid the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish realize this is supposed pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life and can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying make some statement about todays young people and their values in satiric vein however it is hard laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people the real horrors of the world put before us on television stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for few weeks or months give us time catch our collective breaths idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings the time is not right for this type of movie and as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right this is movie that shoud be consigned the trash bin of cinema,0.0

what contrast in the space of two days saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly am not sure you could get two more different movies while the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it this is one interesting movie it is very much in similar vein one of my favourite movies of in the company of men although not quite so nasty there is lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men hurlyburly doenst contain much plot we just follow eddie sean penn around as he tries make sense of his life and the people around him his big question is does it all pertain him and if it does how is he supposed feel about it all it means everything television friends events that happen guess it could be summed up more crudely as what is it all about this is not movie for answers donna anna paquin gives some but they are not really satisfying they just lead more questions that is what makes this movie stay on your mind these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time even when we push them the background however we resolve these questions influences everything we do the performances are all superb in hurlyburly have not seen sean penn in much before in fact cannot remember seeing him in anything but he is brilliant in this eddie is not likeable character but sean penn makes him understandable do not want be his friend but would like help him chazz palminteri is also great as phil making him an awful person would never want know phil but still understand why eddie wants be his friend everyone in this nails their performances making this world real it is nasty world it is sexist world unlike shakespeare in love is unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly is mans world seen unapologetically through the eyes of men find this fascinating and on two counts depressing first it is depressing that such world exists large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in that there are large number of men out there who believe women be completely peripheral their world toys playthings sure everyone is background everyone else but in this world women are long way in the background second these are the movies that are being made stories about mens world where are the stories about womens world not the soap operas and the chick flicks that are meant satisfy women but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men hurlyburly is based on stage play and that is evident from the moment the starts it is very talkative intelligent and static while this can make the drag bit and people sometimes sound like they are quoting textbooks mostly this is good thing not all films have be filled special effects and sweeping panoramas not all films have underestimate the intelligence of their audience all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen it also means that you have pay attention,0.0
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie the gags are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes the plot is weak and the leads are not particularly funny comic team the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the sadly for me they were just not funny enough make the worth watching this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low needs plot it needs characters for empathy value it needs story and an emotional center if is just chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy dogma he tried make philosophical religious comedy and mixed madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully their bedazzled but getting the combination work is very hard do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way do it his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes pastiches and injokes how funny the jokes are will be subjective call for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny there was not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice accuse someone of being gay penis jokes work only so many times showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith jay and silent bob were clever pair of human running gags they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation stoners as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads jay and silent bob played jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks this leaves them at loose ends they are not sure what would be worthwhile do their lives when they hear that comic book characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into movie they decide devote their lives wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way the is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get the problem this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight make the funny silent bob being silent can only contribute the comedy reacting that very expressive face of his this makes his piece of the comedy even less than straight man like dean martin or bud abbott would have jay has be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are long way from being successful comic team their starring roles and the low humor make this comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this feels more like an amateurish skit than real movie certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving they are excuses for gags many of still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the does not offer much an adult audience rate it on the scale and low on the scale,0.0
the previews for the movie are pretty good they show little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together give general impression of the script unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but minutes the residents of mystery love hockey mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit player who is guilty of shooting another man yes that is one of the movies jokes every saturday the best players pair off for game and the whole town comes watch the towns prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated mysterys national fame has the town abuzz week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings him an offer from the nhl the new york rangers will come mystery play the locals the mysterians see this as both good and bad on the one hand they would love have the fame and the money of such an exhibition on the other hand they do not want turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes the movie follows handful of lives that are affected the proposition biebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked coach the boys including his new replacement he is already resentful and top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife crowe is not given lot of room act in this so he is just kind of stuck constantly brooding charlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in town where hockey is the only measure of mans worth his gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being better skater he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons continue disliking him burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled moronic jury of hockey fans walter actually has some experience collegiate hockey but he actively tries put it behind him he wants his son take the game more seriously but he wants his community just get over it reynolds could have been good but sloppy writing andor editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets pull his performance all together one character actually was interesting biebes wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more life than hockey but unlike him she has come accept the skewed view of the community she chose the town and her husband her eyes wide open her unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom mysterty alaska follows handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning the biggest problem this movie is that there is no real heart the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about instead roach and screenwriters david kelley and sean obyrne try cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy they try make you laugh and cry feel outrage and pride they present the framing and cadence for jokes but there is nothing truly funny they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing be really sad about as columnist molly ivins would say it is all hat no cattle the perfect opportunity arises for roach say what this movie is really about there is funeral scene played appropriate gravity and somber music it is chance for the characters reflect on their lives and decide what is truly important russell crowe steps forward speak about spell out the movies metaphor for us he says that what really matters in life is community then adds and hockey guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear only mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves stars even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places but docked it an extra half star when mike myers friend of roach turned up in role that did not suit him myers is comic character actor he puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny he is great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters nobody else in mysterty alaska is comic caricature all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semiserious roles for roach bring in myers for few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the itself it is an acknowledgment the director that the is not worth taking seriously,0.0
a suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche clumsy criminal oaf add the laughs cliche bad guy who owns wild animal cliche crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche at an intense moment our main character tries get away but the car has trouble starting cliche complaining about cliches cliche ok ok so we always hear about cliches but if there was ever be prime example the real mccoy is it not one uttered word not one frame of not one character in this whole movie is not cut and paste example of everything we have ever seen they might as well use this as training how make bank robbery in the karen mccoy kim basinger is bank robber who just got out on parole after sixyear stay at the state prison she wants make things right and go straight especially the fact that she has sixyear old son out there who does not even know she is alive aware of mccoys bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same sixyear old coerce mccoy into returning her past he wants mccoy pull off an elaborate heist of million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying rob six years earlier the way is somehow due schmidt and if she refuses who knows what he will do the kid cue sinister laughter this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it is hard know where begin the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant cannot stress enough how every single element whether it be character the dialogue plot twist etc is so damn generic that you will wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera basinger is absolutely vacant and where do they get off trying make us emotionally attached her heres someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street we are supposed feel sorry for her as she confronts her son who does not even know who she is are we supposed break into tears especially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotionalradiance whatsoever suppose should mention val kilmer yeah that is right he is in it quite sadly too seeing as how can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name and he got second billing be fair will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe t barker unfortunately the script does not allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the we have no time appreciate what he might have brought this project the real mccoy just cannot keep it is head above water and soon very soon sinks into cliched mess of movie the actors are like dummies being moved about an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidts trite dialogue falls like the niagra this is definitely one avoid folks the real mccoy is anything but,0.0
ironically one of the themes of cigarettes is that you should try make the best of every moment in life unfortunately will no longer be able say that lived every moment of my life the fullest because spent otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for movie actually smoking cigarettes in the same minutes could not be any worse for you than it is watch the movie not only is it pathetically bad overall but cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of making resembles home video it is december and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept monica and some are total strangers but they all are face their own personal neuroses before nights end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up those who are not help them come terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone handle their desires on new years eve and tag along the party them they stumble across nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored the substandard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls fake identification and very different thoughts val is monicas cousin and true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cannot find paradoxically it is punks that they meet at bar actually they attempt flee from their presence but are not successful who guide them through their fears and force level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting come terms his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity these two characters is that they seem want be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before while she attempts play this down and be her usual self he is predictably self loathing male as he attempts deal string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when is as putrid as this production there will at least be decent quality of making reveal an occasional moment of glory however this has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory be highlighted instead what you get is collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the goes from one subplot another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened unnecessarily edgy edits from scene scene and shot shot at other times objects seem get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot shot there are also at least scenes in taxi cab that go from start finish not in single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was ray of hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even decent plot payoff at the end but it did not happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball drop at midnight,0.0
s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in two movies dealing the same subject or be precise same high concept in summer that high concept was mad bomber action thriller in few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title the thriller in nicole eggert did few nude scenes the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist the great talent make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison he comes boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police few people except gaerity know the doves violent past when he used be ira terrorist before becoming sick violence betraying gaerity and emigrating america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at doves colleagues friends and relatives dove who is just going retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber while speed does not even try bother plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries be more conventional and provide the action some back story and that is the main reason why it is inferior speed badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all screenplay john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama the plot is of course full of implausibilities the main one is the fact that movie fails explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay those questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background the characters because of them movie seems little bit too long and boring at times the most annoying element of the however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber his acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself this role is in painful contrast the strong performance given that same actor in fugitive the have few bright points though some of the action scenes are fine should be credited director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague but all in all blown away is that was justifiably shadowed its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor,0.0

the haunting so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of horror scare us if you have ever seen movie you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before movie they have things like illustrations and you have guess the movie or facts about the but the one always like are the quot other namequot joke that try and rename particular for instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the small soldiers they had titles like little infantry and can get those fatigues in smaller size well after seeing the haunting had few particular names for it as well unfortunately can only post one of them otherwise would be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers that title would be the confusing ok that is pretty bad title but it fits this perfectly it basically serves up no purpose and combined dry dialogue and boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for cinematic bomb liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth the haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make boatload of money before rant and rave about how bad this is let me point out the few and stress the word few bright spots in this first the house is great looking it looks beautiful but this is also dark spot it looks so great that it is hard be frightened it this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the things look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight haunted house films have contain one element even be slightly successful and that is being eerie the hill house is not eerie it is beautiful but not the least bit frightening ever heard of lili taylor before this did not but am glad that do now she gives the only satisfactory performance in the despite the dry dialogue and boringconfusing concept she manages light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her costars are usually following right behind owen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close giving an admirable performance other then taylor he is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped wilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him add few laughs liam neeson and catherine zetajones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless compassionate scared brave and whatnot they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin the plot is terrible the opening scene of the is very important but the director makes it too obvious getting closeups of all the things that will play major role in the end of the as sat through the kept wondering what this was trying accomplish nell lili taylors character goes from the hunted the savior it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the he forces the viewer make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information for instance the beginning of the gives us sense of why nell is getting involved in the program but we get zilch for the other four plus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes and the worst part most horror films have killings for some reason they kill off luke at the end of the no reason whatsoever just off his head literally overall the haunting is the epitome of bad movie bad plot confusing storyline and waste of good talent hopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into good and be used his full potential hopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such great job in such bad and hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one,0.0
in director edward zwick began his career the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments me at least legends of the fall and courage under fire those two films were not bad just not very good but zwicks latest the siege he has finally made one the siege is modernday actionthriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit the ordeal when city bus explodes several innocent people on it later bomb goes off in broadway theater killing even more they soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key the identity of the arab terrorist there are some movies that simply do not need be made and the siege may very well be one of them oh sure zwick thinks he is making meaningful action since he has added lots of exposition scenes in the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard also starred bruce willis this time willis is horribly wasted as general of the s army who puts state of martial law over nyc during the climax whatever points the siege earnestly tried make were obviously lost in the translation from page screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious say in the first place the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenters vampires placing them all in the category of bad guys the siege contains three fine actorswashington bening and shalhoubbut washington is stuck character that contains not an ounce of even remote development bening has slightly more do and has an intriguing character work while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character the climax of the siege washington giving sermon willis on the socalled message of the story felt like had wandered into sequel on deadly ground in steven seagal gave minute speech at the end about preserving the environment the siege is constantly heavyhanded not entertaining or insightful and just goes prove that not even the best actors can save that lacks satisfactory screenplay,0.0
i guess that if very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and dead prostitute in the bathroom guess that if movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present coincidence poor kyle meek looking jon favreau he is about marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz but before he exchanges his vows he embarks las vegas his friends for one last blowout but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get the prostitute has met horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them jail for very long time surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for few minutes before deciding that the best thing do is bury the body in the desert where she will never be found although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins set in slowly consumes some of the five friends one is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated whenever people look at his van or whenever cop glances his way his blood pressure increases or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family another is michael who was actually responsible for her death he tries bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins affect his judgment as well boyd is the doer of the group seemingly suffering from long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about be exposed he is apt take extreme measures cover up his tracks kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up lauras demanding expectations then there is moore leland orser who speaks lines and walks around puzzled look on his face the problem this reprehensible movie is that it wants be cruel comedy but it presents things in manner that just are not funny drugs mutilation and killing your own friends is not something be laughed at as straight psychological drama could see how it might have worked as each one tried maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways but this movie insults us assuming that we could simply discard our values for hours if you do like this movie do not think that want know you did find slater convincing leader who sways his friends choose not the right thing but the smart play and diaz adds some brightness this as weddingneeding fiancee but her talents are essentially wasted here it is obvious that the maker is trying strike certain tone but the way that he chooses do it is tasteless do not make very bad decision seeing this,0.0
i had been looking forward this since heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on am big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor and in addition think chris farleys onedge extreme acting was riot so naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters almost jumped up and down soda in hand the lights dimming was ready be blown away farleys final starring role and what was supposed be matthew perrys big breakthrough was ready be just amazed for this be among farleys best in spite of david spades absence was ready be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran sadly none of this came pass the humor is spotty at best good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between perry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for it is his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated and the movie tries be smart subject best left alone when it is farley flick the movie is major dissapointment only few scenes worth first look let alone second perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised farley and farleys classic humor is widespread too almost heroes almost works but misses the wagontrain quite longshot guys let us leave the exploring lewis and clark huh stick tommy boy and we will all be friends,0.0
the original babe gets my vote as the best family since the princess bride and it is sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than month ago as one of the years finest films so naturally when entered the screening room that was be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer be found this notion left me puzzled it is rare thing for childrens movie be praised this highly so would not you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking their kids see this supposedly magical piece of work tad bewildered but pleased not have worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along family films sat back for minutes and watched intently and very open mind having great expectations for the looking back should have taken the hint and left right when entered the theater believe me wanted like babe pig in the city the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheeppig has become legitimate national phenomenon but after fateful encounter water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bedridden for number of weeks and the farm begins go under financially the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming downright annoying can come up is make an appearance their new celebrity pet at national fair think and use the money they earn pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known the public problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city completely foreign place both the pig and his companion setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel the unnamed city and shack up sweet lady who just happens love help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led steven wright here is where the took wrong turn up until this point had being having rather enjoyable experience the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even onetenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is dark and disturbing for small children and believe it is at one point dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts drown at other times we are treated surrealistic flashbacks mrs hoggets full cavity search at the airport in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough sustain my interest for an hour and half let alone entertain child another problem found the was it is sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story if you are going make darker and more sinister sequel fine it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is noble ambition but go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of sudden have slapstick finale mrs hogget swinging from walltowall of ballroom in elastic overalls it just did not feel right and was more painful watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie,0.0

i wonder if budget is at all criterion for whether or not movie can be considered an exploitation flick take the professional for example it boasts extremely glossy cinematography couple of recognizable name actors and couple of fairly impressive explosions it is also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features central relationship between middleaged man and twelveyearold girl decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant the professional of the title is new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated one day he is forced let someone into his life when girl from his apartment building knocks on his door her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed crooked and very wired e agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matildas father tried rip him off leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins teach her his profession when she says that she wants avenge the murder of her young brother the two become closer makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out eliminate them both writerdirector luc besson has gone this route before his popular french import la femme nikita slick potboiler about female assassin there is no question that besson can make great looking the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting but beneath the shiny wrapper there is not nearly as much going on as besson would like us believe the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given character develop leon is mostly collection of quirky traits all intended show us that for hired killer he is really not so bad guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies jean reno succeeds at giving leon haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection matilda natalie portman is all wrong for part that called for much grittier quality but she does not have too much work either besson would have been better served spending more time trying bring his characters life and less on feeble attempts at humor are often embarrassing silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is scene where matilda shocks hotel manager announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for cheap gag gary oldmans entire part is something of cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting watch there is not real person be found anywhere in the professional is not always problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying pass itself off as something more more disconcerting problem the professional is that it plays around the sexuality of twelveyearold in really distasteful way there were only two real choices for dealing that component of leon and matildas relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely but besson flirts and teases the audience the idea that he is going show them forbidden love story while choosing simply focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing this is say nothing of the questionable decision make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching child load mm pistol or the blood is spilled aplenty great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world cannot disguise that fact,0.0

making your first feature as not easy assemble decent if not strong cast as writerdirector robert moresco has done one eyed king and you are already ahead of the game but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich and wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at second feature how many more movies do we need about rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned crime or worse the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it again five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop teary music and slow motion in the films first scene the kids grow up be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling make their way out of the heat of the kitchen leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight local mob head armand assante would like say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem get are little tastes of possible plot points he is concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister he looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made genuinely funny touch but none of this ever really amounts anything it seems that morescos greater concern is provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying evoke since scorseses early work so we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar prove us that they really love each other do people actually do this we get lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and whole lot of the fword whether it sounds like it fits or not we also get handful of good actors in small roles that seem lack purpose bruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys you have seen in movies just like this one before assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwins performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it is almost funny moresco theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might first child but the content is probably too personal as result the movies style is heavyhanded in need of considerable amount of toning down nearly every time an action the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us slow dissolves the earlier scene running in slow motion complete dialogue from the present just in case we do not comprehend the link the past moresco needs either trust his audiences intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head it his next project should have little more personal distance and lot more subtlety if he actually gets that chance reviewed as part of our boston festival coverage feature story coming soon,0.0
whenever s government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready use mantra that says look who is talking what have you done the indians however even the americans themselves are ready use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes is just another example its revisionist westerns made in early those movies tried exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding the th anniversary of columbus discovery of america one of such examples is geronimo an american legend western directed walter hill that deals one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers the hero of the is geronimo played wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used give hard time white settlers during the second half of th century when the movie begins in geronimo and his apaches made peace s government and try live peacefully in arizona reservation however broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless not more or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign general crook gene hackman commander of s army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his force is not enough catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest instead he turns people who are more experienced apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall together young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo geronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors so the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies almost all of them happen be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity express how sorry they feel for having fight him and his people although such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo be honest walter hill does try make geronimo the real hero of the but the movie segments that deal the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time instead they turn out be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band make even worse hill has some real problems pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers the movie should have been better if it turned geronimos life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting wes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces lot of passion in his role contrary him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies while this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall even hills directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers ask what had happened the great action director of even his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints the score that shifts between indian motives and classic on the other hand photography lloyd ahern ii the use of red lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed be melancholic epic all in all compared some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness this is not so bad but we are left the unpleasant impression that it could have been better,0.0

easely one of the worst films of the year the millenium just around the corner is playing our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil the result is somewhat predictable did not have high hopes about arnolds much anticipated return the big screen schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers will not be bored and the catholic league will be angry everyone else will see end of days for what it is deliciously bad motion picture think of it as hollywoods own yk bug did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers you will get as in yes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun behold he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc the way it works is he smirks and something explodes before the stroke of the new millennium he is got find and impregnate certain woman in order climb out from under heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations only schwarzeneggers cop attached an antiterrorist unit can stop him films like this has one serious weakness logic no matter how you twist the plot you will find it incredibly stupid even for schwartzenegger movie the incredible fact is that such directors never learn after thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich here the devil looks more like sex addicted maniac that has just got out of mental institution he is walking around y blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in meter radius all he wants is the girl that is somehow special but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in church where satan dare not enter so the evil one is forced seduce the good cop in order get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back can give you happiness that you can only dream of just give me the address indeed script like that you could make wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting create provoking an dramatic thriller and for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will not be very satisfied we have not seen him in while that is because he did not have worthy opponent he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop so after all those fights what is left for arnold schwarzenegger how about satan in my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons terminator and that is schwartzeneggers strength muscles and no emotions here he tries achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar this is called an adult turn if successful and flop if unsuccessful make wild guess his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems this requires at least some acting skills regrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles the rest of the cast are struggling their so called characters the movie is otherwise technically impressive solid cinematography and fine lighting but the movie does not serve neither as serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone the only real comic relief in this is when swartzenegger tries cry the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular so really have hard time recommending this somebody unless you are diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away as for schwarzenegger he will be back,0.0
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in few years in the future early are going be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia however doubt that people are going be very nostalgic about the products of that period one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american industry lack of originality and ideas being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this pairs two a policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement two of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going flood the market cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this borrows its female lead from basic instinct the best gags are same as many other similar movies shown in the trailers the rest simply does not work only those who used watch lot of products in that period would laugh others would probably wince at the lameness of humour some would be entertained celebrity cameos that pop up every once in while but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of movie is simply not worth the effort the was sometimes criticised for being the parody of series that already had strong comic overtones the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour using the loaded weapon joke in their fourth sequel,0.0
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american has never been what would consider thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of maker who is managed no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on he toils starship troopers was essentially bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war soldier of orange great that is nearly impossible find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set monotonous scenes of graphic carnage it is not completely successful but as failure it is certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming of age set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange have not yet gotten around seeing the th man or turkish delight believe his best be robocop bleak superhero satire robotic hero that is as touching as schwarzeneggers in that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics its violence seemed be there for purpose namely create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not simply titillate an attention deprived audience there is jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys cop before snuffing him he tortures the officer taking glee in his victims every fearful tic it is startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the that could be designated as splatter punknoir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just will not shut up he impales coworker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced as smug genius the kind who is always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world hear sort of like scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this has him pull shift into psychotic movie monster the kind who just will not die hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk of beef scientist played josh brolin who is saddled the films worst lines have lost cohesion again they are typical aaron spelling couple goodlooking but as vacant as george bushs republican national convention speech e bush referring clinton so much promise but what end what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty does not look so absurd the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other series of strained oneliners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique ahh what cynical time we

hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough test this out on human begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear each new release that it is verhoevens films that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days it is an affront anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping spend saturday night fun thrillaminute ride verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick nobody root for and no reason care the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have good time at that utilizes state of the art fx illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty his bad self couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friends and got into long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first do so and whoa in serious manner boot but oh yeah it is directed paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background it is plainly obvious that verhoeven is not exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it is funny that all the technology million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying figure out how show womans naked breast manipulated an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks in fact it is largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since the end most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat as in every mad slasher we get the killers pov scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked the only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy it happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted it is little moment in big nothing offer but ground breaking special effects set plot that should have run its course the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or still know what you did last summer and they are the only reason check out hollow man preferably as midweek bargain rental you have been warned but you probably will not listen will you tis pity,0.0
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less quality of his work in movies but the quantity most of those movies were produced cannon group company led israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman movie mentors of future legends unfortunately that did not happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal sadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in that capable character actor and action hero of the tried raise their worth simply being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process on the other hand bronson could take comfort in fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience or times younger than bronson himself one of such movies that seriously marred bronsons reputation is death wish third sequel in the series began death wish in in the original movie bronson played paul kersey mildmannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim urban violence that movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry unfortunately six years later cannon group got rights the character of paul kersey and began destroying it pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director did not stop the rapid decline of the quality death wish begins when kersey comes visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated young criminals and people too old or too poor move out before the reunion kerseys friend falls victim the street gang led evil fraker played gavan oherlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the kersey decides avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants use him as secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime bronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine although bronsons charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his and armed single pistol manages wipe out dozens of opponents superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronsons own commitment could be seen in very few lines spoken in the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order give some more motives for kerseys crusade on the other hand emotions are much better played confronting lawabiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough be killed in droves kersey unfortunately michael winner does not know how work out the plot and after torturing the viewers mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie bang the big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevolike battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget in short this movie could be recommended only the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for nostalgia special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in small role of portorican wife,0.0
overblown remake of the robert wise of the same name based on shirley jacksons novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in supposed insomnia study being initiated liam neeson he is actually conducting study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected it he drags the test subjects out foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies the original was great psychological horror this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary in fact feel it is downright impossible make modern day pg horror movie that is scary unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then there is nothing in this that will raise hackles nearly fell asleep twice during the and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me did not seem have such personal relationship the characters that he felt he needed discuss every decision they made them as the progressed it is sad see such an amazing cast wasted so badly owen wilson spends most of the wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice his wonderful comic ability catherine zetajones always nice look at is given the woefully underwritten role of bisexual insomniac that gets run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs liam neeson pops in from time time talk into his tape recorder and attempt convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what is going on as the rest of them do finally poor lili taylor the center of the gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets scream and try rescue her apparently subplot involving tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed that is too bad because it might have lent some better characterization the narrative this is jan de bonts second straight misfire speed cruise control being the first when is he going learn that bigger is not always necessarily better robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that one should not approach haunted house movie twister mindset if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served make the terrifying what our mind fashions on it is own can be thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything apparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under it is original title certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had pg,0.0
tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies come out in quite while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it is not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heavens gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drips off the screen like movie nobody wanted be associated begs the question of why it was made in the first place all the good scripts lying around unproduced how does needless drek like this make its way the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films have ranged from the very good greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down the really bad tarzan the ape man bo derek most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties starring exolympic athletes and lot of cutsie chimps therefore if another tarzan movie is be made one might assume that it would have something new offer different angle an original storyline anything set it apart from all the others greystoke added neverbeforeseen level of realism the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the misguided audacity sexualize the story as vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing offer but bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue the script bayard johnson and anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come comic books have better plots than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy george of the jungle did not the producers think leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs the story starts the legend of tarzan already firmly established quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised apes and his return england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie starts in he is civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is marry jane jane march in less than week however when wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africas last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back the jungle at first jane refuses go pouting about how it will interfere their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman once the gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city most of the socalled adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting no pace tension or action speak of there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark the goonies when the movie is running short on action it includes few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing baby elephant from trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river the movie is also lacking even remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit cobra he does not even attempt suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do instead he ties tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle no plan for survival of course one cannot help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however lost pyramid suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up the special effects are not worthy of madefortv movie also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had slog through numerous underground caverns get the lost pyramid when it is sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city is not even bad enough have camp quality although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks wellgroomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of prettyboy be an effective tarzan he is calvin klein model in loin cloth also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington makes decent villain although he is like charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the exmodel jane march has little do but smile and look pretty next tarzan she does fire off gun at the evil treasure hunters time or two but whenever snake comes into the picture she is reduced hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable fill even an hour and half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency be short,0.0
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence billy zane is wooden as the hero kristy swanson is given very little do and does very little it treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains have ever seen in movie only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in good performance she has energy and spunk the movie needed much more of oh yeah the phantom also has secret identity but this is so poorly played out you will not even care about the only things can recommend are good performance jones and some colorful scenery however if youre looking for fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper this is not good movie,0.0

the corruptor is big silly mess of an action movie complete pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence it is not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it does not make shred of sense and whose idea was it have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action james foley knows lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor but the quiet scenes clash the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like movie and more like derailed train at least we have chow yunfat in the lead role chow plays nick chen chinatown cop he is good cop as the first few scenes establish and he is very familiar chinatown that is probably why the powersthatbe decide team him up rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nick and danny begin stepping on each others toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get chance save the other ones life what happens after that is kind of mystery me am fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann am also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff am not quite sure why henry lee decides employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way there is also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox but it does not have much do the main story one of the problems as said is that the movie does not make any sense do not blame this entirely on foley because he is obviously good director am more inclined point my finger at robert puccis script does not seem be in tune the way normal people act one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because he is angry about his new white partner he is shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and was thinking that would have fired him if he had done that me in addition the takes bite into racerelated issues and never develops them at all there are lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent there is also considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents the plot itself never straightens out am not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated them or what they do as group the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated loud and violent action sequences the sequences are not bad but they are not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen one too many would imagine foleys strength is clearly in characterization and he does pretty good job here the scenes between nick and danny are very good and actually got feel for their characters bond forms between them that holds parts of the together chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but he is still fun watch also liked the subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance is powerful and his character makes compelling moral compass for danny but the ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes complicated plot can be successful but the story needs make sense when it is over the corruptor never manages make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally there is nothing left hold on,0.0

for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or what is left of it in mainstream movie are star vehicles are terrible things as rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made advance the media but rather advance the career of particular actor an actor might be chosen on the upandup give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down hand him paycheck generally though the actor does not matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but the time the real plot starts we are into todds later years he is about be replaced new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this class caine jason scott lee will be our villain and you know he is the villain because he has staring contest our hero near the movies start between the two leads less than full typed page of dialogue is spoken and it is possible imagine script is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last years icy thriller event horizon does not show any inventiveness here and instead is content let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left die on garbage planet but in order stretch the running time out the villains return the garbage planet on routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes be todd fails show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess automatic weaponry it is not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as parody of typical action fare like universal soldier strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and next year large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television,0.0
director doug ellins kissing fool released earlier this year is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story like sitcom jokes so lame that it would be impossible overlay laugh track on it the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame the script james frey and the director is filled vapid actors who read meaningless lines you have heard before am not wearing any underwear the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster max in what she assumes will be surefire comeon line max chicagos biggest playboy decides get married after whirlwind love affair sam short for samantha max and sam possess two irritating personalities and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience max is played without any style david schwimmer schwimmer whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality makes an unlikely lover his costar mili avital as sam is cut from the same cloth so they can be argued be matched pair after all people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn each other ditto for similar looks so why should not the personalitychallenged be attracted the implausible plot has max asking his best friend jay jason lee hit on sam as test jay is supposed try get her sleep him but stop short of the actual act max being promiscuous nature worries that his future bride may have the same need sleep around as he does the idea of flirting the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable eat or work neither the script nor the actors make this test believable the question is how do you know you are the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness the finally there is the films attempt at physical comedy jays exgirlfriend natasha vanessa angel becomes infatuated jay again once she thinks he is going out someone else natasha rips jays shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa as she throws her hair on his bare chest she demands he pull it this is supposed be funny most films have some saving grace some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed be funny even if the rest of the picture was not kissing fool on the other hand has nothing recommend it kissing fool runs it is rated for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers,0.0
i am continually amazed at movies like this that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on script as abysmal as this one is mindboggeling but it seems happen lot nowadays wild wild west is beautifully filmed well acted and well directed piece of garbage and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault in short this movie is comedy without laughs so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal the high production values keep it from being total fiasco but it is still pretty boring will smith stars as jim west an old western rb variation of the james bond character west is teamed up artemus gordon kevin kline and they are pretty much polar oppisites west prefers solve his problems an array of bullets gordon traditionally favors more pacifistic approach talk about deeply developed characters at any rate this leads the inevitable conflicts between methodologies none of are funny the year is several top scientists have been abducted and the suspected culprit is disgruntled former confederate general bloodbath mcgrath ted levine president grant sends west and gordon investigate there is evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh another disgruntled former confederate as it turns out loveless plans use the combined knowledge of the scientests create the ultimate super weapon he will use conquer the united states would go further the plot but there is not any point this films narrative is little more than jumbled unfunny mess only laughed at couple of jokes and then only lightly there is not one truly uprorously funny moment in this and that is pretty disasterous when you consider that it is primarily comedy as said the fault is totally that of the script when you consider their respective roles will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done the leads could have been played samuel jackson and robert de niro and the still would have been awful no one and mean no one can make line like bye bye mr knife guy sound good still this has lot going for it visually the set design is fantastic maybe even oscar worthy the cinematogrophy michael ballhaus who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant goodfellas is absolutely stunning he lends the much needed exciting comic bookish look will not fault barry sonnenfeld either he does fine job of directing the proceedings but like the rest of the people involved the there really is not anything that he can do correct its one major flaw despite being beautifully made wild wild west becomes quite boring after the halfway point the appeal of the visuals ends long before the does if wild wild west did not look so good it would be almost insufferable as it is it is somewhat tolerable but not very entertaining it hurts give such well made movie score this low but there is not anything much worse than an unfunny comedy,0.0

depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas classic yojimbo a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones classic fistful of dollars a prohibitionera action drama completely original storyline new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing is as the first version of the story nods the _real_ source material the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what do that material than hammett himself this time around the man no name is played bruce willis fellow shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way mexico all appearances jericho is well on its way becoming ghost town the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border one is headed an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer doyles side but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins play the two sides against each other while trying stay one step ahead of both of them viewers familiar both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent remakescumbastardizations there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli question the bosses trust in smith brutal beating and big fire director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including pair of guns for willis have the ability propel an assailant backward sufficient thrust achieve escape velocity but at least he does not try turn the story into slasher or buddy picture what he _does_ do is nearly as big mistake and that is provide running voiceover narration willis rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling the problem is that both yojimbo and fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters they were mystery the other characters in the and the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed their almost mythical status john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying stay alive it feels like hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness his text for his choice but it simply does not work the narration allows the man no name take us into his confidence and the man no name takes _no one_ into his confidence even if you walk into last man standing as blank slate cannot imagine it being much more than heavily armed minor distraction willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still level on he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos and there is not another single character whom makes even the slightest impression no compelling antagonist for smith there is no buildup towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hills flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration sometimes when someone sees lackluster remake of revered original they will wonder what all the talk was about in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about,0.0
okay bear me you all cause first off have get this off my chest what the hell is up that damn crab whew okay cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe even know that you need more footage than that and that was not the only thing getting on my nerves the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first minutes of the movie at first the movie moves along at quick interesting pace it is speedily established that something magical is about happen amanda when she encounters totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just does not die ridiculous concept yes but at this point am willing accept it because am willing accept that this is how amandas life is changed how her powers are received later on the movie cannot seem decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in tom and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they were not just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on particular development amanda suddenly becoming great chef her falling in love tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good some places the plot just does not make sense sometimes it is way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice cannot beat that all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected not romantic at all and only funny in some places so okay do the magic powers come from the crab or the fairy godfather she can float now too and all of sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food tom all of sudden just accepts amandas witchcraft in the end would people really dine in restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video what the hell is up that damn crab it is unfortunate because liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome the seemed skirt around serious theme or at least theme for while but towards the end it resolved show us long flashback clips and minutes of people crying at their tables the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing the dolls gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has particular charm but much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for character it is almost funny sometimes see these two trying so hard make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying make the relationship seem more plausible the supporting character nolan was highlight though he reminded me bit of kevin in you have got mail see footnotes and as always typical of chick flick romantic comedy there is seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places this sort of got on the nerves after while too simply irresistible is not hard understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it cannot draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick and how could refrain from making pun simply irresistible is all too easy resist first viewing did anyone else think this was tad bit similar you have got mail or the shop around the corner business rivals fall in love female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down female as mother like figure guiding her the annoying hysterical exgirlfriends _really_ like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe,0.0
i went blair witch project book of shadows the highest of hopes the original released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying hoped that this movie would live up its predecessor unfortunately my hopes were soon dashed as the movie opens the audience is shown pseudodocumentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx their town as result of the original blair witch project movie it is mostly humorous selfaware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first during this segment we are introduced the protagonist young man who sells blair witchrelated memorabilia from his website the movie then cuts title that informs us that what we are about see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in mental institution the sort of one only finds in bad horror movies we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while cigarettesmoking doctor luridly leers above him we see him throwing himself wildly around padded room we see him cowering naked in shower stall as fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred again had sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally hospital scene that is set poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is sure sign that you are in the throes of truly horrible movie the movie cuts again this time the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there is no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt is promotional gimmick he came up and sells on his website we meet tristen and steven young couple who are writing book about the blair witch experience steven is skeptic believing the whole thing be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth the rumors of supernatural occurrence she is wan and softspoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did know because in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica wiccan flowing hair and wide eyes who wants prove that the blair witch was good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in cemetery kim is dressed completely in black has extreme gothstyle makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it is never explained the party of five heads off into the woods as promised they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp complete extensive video equipment record the nights events there is brief encounter rival blair witch tour group who had planned camp at that site as well but after few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be great point get up and go the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow the videotapes are missing but thanks psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found ooh spooky the team goes back jeffreys house creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods regroup and review the tapes they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen starts having weird dreams in she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird runelike burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes hell in handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue scrutinize the videotapes seem have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have play the tapes backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes okay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie was awful simply awful the characters are broadlydrawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the natureloving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliches were used illustrate these caricatures how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she is pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wears lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is bad guy because he has jagged teeth and talks like he is straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at its worst rather than taking the time flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose give each one few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight the action it did not work on top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at hospital that looks like it belongs in bad slasher movie let us get on plane home no am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want find out what is going on ok frankly the end of the movie was rooting for the witch also felt that there was simply too much blood gore in this the first movie worked never showing us the horror the witch was palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror was all offscreen and thus our imaginations worked overtime envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed such niceties and went straight for the grossout this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat and continued throughout the as the audience is treated occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears be ritual massacre of some sort knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me care this movie did not stop showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours it is all explained in fact it is all shown onscreen in loving detail confess being someone who prefers horror movies in you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster be infinitely more terrifying have seen interviews the director in he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only the human mind found this be miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the directors intent then he needs have some words the writer because it was not made clear at all know lot of people who like go parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations group of other people

i am giving this stinker normally the worst that would ever rate movie would be but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come the big goose egg am not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all maybe in mels little mind horse being knocked unconscious because of punch the face is funny in mine it is not or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking because only the selfrighteous lee uses the nword more often in his films than brooks did in this one at least lee has the smarts realize that nobody is going find that term amusing brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it wrong mel would call you boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere this idiotic attempt at comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors harvey korman attempts clear out town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it the railroad he sends his goons run the townsfolk out but the town appeals the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles send them new sheriff protect them the governor pawns the task off kormans character hedley lamarr can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name lamarr decides send the town black sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of black man living among them that they will all just leave hold on have got stop while these gales of laughter pass it is just too funny racism passing as humor gosh why did not anybody ever think of that one before oh wait think somebody might have they are called the kkk am not calling brooks racist but am calling him an insensitive bastard who would not know what was funny if it hit him over the head but digress anyway the black sheriff rides into town amid flurry of townsfolk using the nword golly will the hilarity just never end he ends up joining forces drunk gene wilder who happens be the former fastest gun in the west together they save the day from evil not one person in this movie gives decent performance wilder looks like he is recovering from head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed be part of the movie ok he really did not but he should have the films star cleavon little goes along the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience admit starting snicker on couple of occasions actually the end started look as if it was going have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie can say full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever mel brooks would be doing the world favor if he burned every last copy of this,0.0
days in the valley is more or less pulp fiction knock off it basically involves how bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways am not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever explain and quite frankly am not willing spend any more time on it than the hours that have already wasted while it tries very hard be pulp fiction days in the valley falls way short this is quite condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels while the story is not much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better days in the valley does have couple of bright spots james spaders character while not much better than the rest is at least fun watch in sick sort of way and we do get see nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role you know movie is not that good when the highlight is brawl between two women even if they are both gorgeous will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in they managed intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted but marveling at that ingenuity is far cry from actually enjoying the result while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect the other half of the characters that really cared absolutely nothing about if were put number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable watch this is the sort of movie that only huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment not even charlize theron being naked would get me sit through this movie again or at least not all of it anyway,0.0

okay okay maybe was not in the mood watch mindless action movie am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it was not as good as the others howewer the latest segal picture did not look that bad and since none of my friends would go see woody allen movie even if paid them went see it expecting mild die hard rehash boy was wrong in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted segals acting he is not simply wooden he is like wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense of course in movies like these there must be sidekick and love interest in these one we are given two for one package in the form of playboy model in the movie only functions as supposed comic relief the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem be interested in each other have never seen so little chemistry between two people in movie often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing how many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys too many was able predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds explain his plan him the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has fight the hero hand hand etc simply said this is moviemaking the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience my recommendation if you go see it bring watch you will be looking at it for most of the movie my rent die hard read book stare at the sky do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid the real sad thing is that there are lot of movies out that would rather have seen once again dragged in my friends the way liked the movie halfheartedly they probably like wrestling too,0.0
in life eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced life in prison after about an hour of watching this movie you begin realize how their characters feel fortunately for audience members there is chance escape the nearest exit this undoubtedly is eddie murphys worst movie and that is an accomplishment remember the golden child harlem nights compared life they look like citizen kane life is long predictable foulmouthed and only intermittently funny its minute running time feels like years robert ramsey and matthew stones script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring everyone around them as motherf or s you lose count how many times both those obnoxious offensive words are used and if that all it takes write script than any illiterate jackass can sit at word processor and compose movie but like life it will probably stink be honest the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well life is as sophisticated as belch it is crude and stereotypical years ago movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient secondclass people good for being only maids and servants for the most part the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved but new more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies in many recent films through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers blacks are presented as fasttalking conniving scam artists or hiphop guncrazy sexcrazed youths both sets of caricatures are demeaning and the fault does not rest the actors they have eat too it is the people who write the scripts the studios who greenlight the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest lifes only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into year olds otherwise life is an embarrassment blot on the resumes of those associated it see it at your own risk,0.0
those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely be surprised the fact that have not read victor hugos novel les miserables do not know if lot of people have though imagine many are familiar the popular musical based on the novel have not even seen that going into this had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters even expected the be musical walking away from it am kind of glad had no prior experience the material writerdirector bille augusts version is straightforward beautifully told liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from year prison sentence he is allowed stay in convent kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior the priests words of wisdom influence him and he makes vow change himself nine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago conflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned vigo valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean be convict javert is hellbent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power bring jean justice along the way valjean meets and falls in love peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows take care of her daughter cosette played later claire danes les miserables is visually solid and often striking picture the production design anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets do not look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced though it does get bit heavy at times many scenes in the have memorable photographic quality such as the climax takes place next dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening augusts keeps the story simple hear is good thing since the novel is so complex and easy follow he manages develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately was also impressed that he did not go overboard flash and style is something so many directors seem be doing classic stories these days such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo juliet this feels solid and whole and each scene has certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly man who clearly fits that adjective thurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has lot of range and can perform in very nonglamorous role such as this one rush is absolutely incredible as javert do not remember ever feeling so strongly about villain as do here he adds depth and complexity subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense cannot be as charitable for danes however though know she is talented actress here she tends overact when it might have been better underplay the character bit les miserables is as have said solid intelligent motion picture my only complaint is that it feels bit too easy and perhaps too staged each scene is grand and huge and exploding poledouris score but did not always want them be for the most part les miserables is not subtle or deep picture it is good movie and tells its story well but august tends handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle however in this exciting and wellproduced few minor flaws are easily overlooked,1.0
this is stagy adapted from roger rueffs play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them rent hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim score substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately land this new account it is their only reason for coming the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmentalk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is young man who has just recently been hired the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and different attitude their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make living these are tough questions and the truth seems be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this tries get you see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying see why he is on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion what they do as both must sell their product and how after each ones psyche is stripped clean the other there is pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered disarming smile and an eagerness for him prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is baptist who takes very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion just look at another woman and lust after her is sin according the way he reads the bible when asked larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and cannot even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode establish how serious he is about being salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burnedout he tells him go on vacation get woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been charmer shaking everyones hand trying please his clients while trying make the sale larry is more aggressive as salesman he is always heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller does not arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke the secretary larry throws tantrum and is resigned going back their home office without the new account but when they start talking bob whom they forced act as the bartender they are surprised learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking him about jesus bob then tells the boys about private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob attend larry and phil cannot fathom how bob did not make sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide prep bob on how get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced waiting for this smug kid come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through marvelous performance the only problem the is that its more of play than cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it good product see,1.0
the coen brothers are back again this time homers odyssey as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from mississippi chain gang who trek across the south find secret treasure in brother where art thou right for the beginning of brother the coens grab your attention chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison work song the camera flows around the hard toiling men giving visually exciting symmetry the scene that ends our three heroes ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john turturro escaping across cotton field it is the beginning of journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies each member of the trio strong suite as always the coen brothers is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films their characters are goofy and comical like nicolas cage in raising arizona or dramatic as albert finney and john turturro in millers crossing and even mix of the two frances mcdormand in fargo in all cases and in brother too the characters populating their films are threedimensional people ulysses everett is handsome hairobsessed petty criminal silver tongue and not lot in the brains department but he seems like genius when compared the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader promised treasure of million their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homers original material as they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and cyclops who beats them and takes all their money there is magic too when delmar believes that pete was turned into horny toad the sirens the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys adventures giving the flick choppy episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow some of the interludes are an epiphany though the trio becomes quartet when they pick up guitarplaying tommy johnson chris thomas king and visit radio station in the middle of nowhere run its blind owner stephen root they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded as they sing the traditional tune am man of constant sorrow it is wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us in my mind the best movie song of the year contrasting this and other wonderful moments the sexy seduction the sirens comes mind are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of brother in particular near the end is scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash ku klux klan rally save tommy from being lynched the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of the wizard of oz they do not say lions and tigers and bears oh my and there is no dorothy but it is the land of oz we are seeing here the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered fine acting on several levels george clooney is funny charming little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today he has the charm of s movie idol and is able put himself into silly situations dignity ulysses has an ongoing obsession his hair risking life and limb get particular brand of pomade and supply of hairnets his vanity will come plague him as it would any mystical herowanderer while clooney is the name draw for brother the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who at one point hears the word of the lord and joins members of church congregation in their mass baptism delmar is saved and dedicates his life doing good and provides richness his simple character that makes him shine the taciturn pete as played longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst all together the tuneful triumvirate is mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove be buffoons albeit brave ones the colorful supporting cast is rampant homerian characters meet and get know along the way of the boys odyssey charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy odaniel who keeps crossing paths them in his bid for reelection john goodman is wicked as the oneeyed bible salesman and con artist big dan teague michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary george babyface nelson stephen root is amusing as the blind dj reping one of the many references the sightless that abound in the in mystical ways holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses estranged wife penny and the real reason for this adventure not secret treasure techs are as expected in coen brothers venture first class cinematographer roger deakins who has worked on five previous coen films captures the sultry atmosphere of the south the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided dennis gassner and mary zophres respectively once again roderick jaynes the alter ego of ethan and joel coen is on board as editor the high points outweigh the low through most of brother where art thou particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music give it b,1.0

there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects get enlightenment but in the commitment given seeking wisdom even if it is foolish road one is on and it seems be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the yearold lucy carrie and the yearold bea bella has arrived for years stay the selfabsorbed mother oblivious how her daughters might be adjusting this foreign experience while she is searching for change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she says she is as she is making some attempt contact sufi sheikh there who has all the answers she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip does not seem like it is much fun more like misadventure some romance local moroccan thrown in drugs worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came morocco smoke the good hashish found there and live the good life cheaply and be in spot where they did not have worry about being hassled the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons follow the mystical sufis seem lost following culture that is far different from where they were coming from the is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the her mother and sister it is written the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls julia strapped for cash and not receiving needed check her husband often forgets send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really do not know what make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed her mothers loose attitude and wants go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them stay in his small village it seems only that bilals charm is matched his shiftlessness as he has wife who still lives there this scene did not make too much sense as why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but doubt that the family is now stuck without money in backward area trying decide what do next as they hitch ride away from there truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has good disposition for travel while bea just wants go school and learn something and be normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched the terrific performance of kate winslet as the accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like be westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough be able go home the better off for her experiences as many dropout reluctantly had do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy look at and easy grasp the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose go there for themselves the familys travel is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and vacuous life that is starting bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat her is starting wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted see but who died before she got chance see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems tell her what she could not comprehend from anyone else even comforting her telling her that her tears are memories gift from god the films weakness was the empty feeling got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip morocco who were taken in the mystical culture of sufism teaching that has lot offer its followers contrary the impression the might give seemed pass her her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but have behaved more like hippie and she would not have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the is built on is mother who cares about the children but does not know how take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying escape from reality and that returning london she has another chance see if she can find the key this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she is at this is very freudian way look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who is say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was,1.0

when people are talking about good old times they actually want make some bad times look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked aids for people who actually had live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked lost ideals of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era martin scorseses taxi driver symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all the movies protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he cannot sleep at nights the job gets him exposed the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantines presidential campaign their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake inviting her porno movie theatre losing his only link better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is battle scum on the street he purchases formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back dostoyevski loss of moral compass in bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in th century same as in our times for others the movie uses raskolnikovlike figure in order portray burning problems of america its apparent inability deal the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of lifetime can give arguments for both sides his travis bickle has lot in common most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempts establish some kind of human connection the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him person too goofy be the hero and too pathetic be the classic villain however most of the average viewers are sensible enough recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but does not have stomachlack of brains do it while de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the mostly played the character actors give it distinctively feel wizzard played peter boyle presents the only link americas better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice troubled travis illustrates the inability of pres generations find answers the problems of gloomy decade other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended reallife pimps in other prepare for his role of lifetime is dressed like hippie iris found excuse for her escape the world of drugs and child prostitution in ideology of counterculture porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in postvietnam and postwatergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program cannot fool even such idiots like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism cannot be washed away even ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order spill the gloom of schraders screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed as hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory,1.0

seen april at m at crossgates cinema guilderland y theater myself for free using my hoyts critics pass theater rating very good seats sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter new person you have just become part of story everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but part nevertheless that seems be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways in order test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble cast of characters that would not usually be the types have an entire revolve around them such as teenage supermarket cashier bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors these types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected strip club bouncer and his psychotic father midlevel drug dealer narc obsessed multilevelmarketing horny wedding guests zen lovemaker two shrimpscarfers and cute normal teenage girl round things out how they will all come together is the process the deals would imagine the concept the started out as the creators testing themselves see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the starts out as anything else little indication of what is come we meet ronna polley depressed los angeles checkout girl who does not seem have much desire do anything except work just pay her rent she is not very charming especially her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works maybe this is because she is not very afeminite character but she is far from masculine creative character indeed things start progress when ronna reluctantly agrees take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences this agreement starts threepronged storyline as it allows simon go las vegas for the weekend his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of will not only bring ronna close being arrested but also death nearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we do not think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players the films makeup another process used the filmmakers elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the really begins show its mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it is clear this is not going employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it is long overdue change of pace needed in movies today and so the begins take shape first following ronna and her friends on onenight adventure that begins drug deal instigated zack and adam who were actually looking for simon does not exactly go as planned but that is what keeps it all so interesting the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story but this time the camera chooses follow simon instead simon and his three friends head vegas for night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps ronnas story telling much of the same story but from completely different angle we are shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the events that do happen ronna because of zack and adam are not even their fault they just happened be where they were when they were would really like dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who have not seen the perhaps the greatest element the is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due plot twists or confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still can list and analyze nearly everything the does so well direction trying piece together such complex story is no easy task and for rookie filmmaker such as liman it is great accomplishment he does not just depict story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled detail and creative in general it is clear the script has been inspired many sources both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams ripoff tonemood where other films have failed bring the charm of the independents the mainstream this one is able create its own sense of the macabre it is not overlydark or twisted and the comedy is not so satirical for it be considered black comedy more like macabre light cinematographyart direction able photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we are able get sense of who they are what they are thinking and how they came be in their situations even when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch performances every actor nails their role see above themetheory the does not seem be concerned conveying any kind of political or social messages instead it is more of philosophical experiment in fact it might not have

mars attacks jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones this is director tim burtons finest date many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films however as whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than id and loved id you really have be in the right frame of mind enjoy this it is completely wackedout and unlike anything you have ever seen once the silly tone of the is set it is easy just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do not mix the plot is simple martians invade the earth but it is different than any other invasion usually it is the evil aliens versus the heroic humans this time however it is the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans the martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things have seen in long time they look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious and about the special effects the effects in mars attacks are just about the most flawless ones have seen date the computer animation of the martians combined the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem real there are just couple of scenes that do not work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship also glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise but there are many big laughs in the as said if you are in the right mood could it have been funnier certainly was it funny enough yes was entertained absolutely on personal note would like thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the as warcrazy general decker finally after many very small parts in direct video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in real movie that many people will see while he is not given the type of role that you can give real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue the preview audience saw the really seemed enjoy him,1.0
when was asked see this movie friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant was perhaps wrong be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation street hooker just could not picture him in any romantic lead what makes this movie wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries it brilliantly written script this writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is master in the domain of the romantic comedy splashes of drama thrown in between hugh and his hair is almost identical the character that made him famous in four weddings he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck unfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie if only he would dither little less julia knows this role well the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love there are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness how sad it must be be so wealthy and beautiful but have no one share it the writer deals difficult issues of love and social class on various levels how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love grow in such harsh environment how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice,1.0
you would think it would be easy spoof star trek but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it that is bit more difficult the farfetched scifi series is after all enormously popular what its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies if you are not nice it you lose galaxy quest is star trek what mel brookss spaceballs was star wars an affectionate riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems meanspirited or malintentioned the show is been cancelled but the journey is far from over that is the current tagline of galaxy quest star trek type show that is no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns it also lives on in conventions gatherings of the show is obsessive fans who never fail dress in galaxy quest costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble jason nesmith tim allen played commander peter quincy taggart on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have do the attitudes of the rest tommy webber daryl mitchell gwen demarco sigourney weaver fred kwan tony shalhoub and alexander dane alan rickman range from indifference utter contempt dane who played spocklike alien is especially disgusted considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing recite his characters cheesy trademark line grabthars hammer you shall be avenged or something like that for his diehard fans one day nesmith is greeted an especially fanatical group of galaxy quest followers they are actually aliens from planet known as thermia they have mistaken the galaxy quest episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel the next day the thermians whisk nesmith away spaceship help them defeat the evil sarris named in one of the films only meanspirited gags after village voice critic andrew sarris nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig and sort of blows it off but when he is transported or should say shot back earth in rather celestial manner he believes next thing the cast knows they are being dragged nesmith this spaceship of course they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is spaceship what they want do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them but after some persuading they stay on fight the icky sarris and find way provide peaceful existance for the flailing thermians was quite surprised how well this comedy came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign worked taking shots at both the obvious and notsoobvious elements of star trek and its fandom galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs opting instead for broad but smart parody nothing is safe not the cliches not the fans not the absurd taglines but on the other hand everything is safe since galaxy quest treats its subject utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoubs fred k tech sergeant chen who when in character is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek while scotty who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell need more power down here captain chens cry for help is more the tune of the core like will not take it or something it is hoot but it does not stop there weaver whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman his relentlessly holierthanthou attitude are not far behind galaxy quest succeeds as funny parody of star trek and while it is not masterpiece it tends falter in its more serious moments it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season grabthars hammer this is hell of movie,1.0
in my review of there is something about mary said something the effect of laughter is not everything now need make brief addendum my postulate laughter is not everything unless am watching jim abrahams see spoofs are easy me love movies and love movies that make fun of movies that love sometimes am the only one in the theater laughing sometimes laugh so hard that embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone elses laughter sometimes laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore the end of the abrahams latest mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me it is gotten some mediocre reviews but hey am the guy who laughs at everything there may be lot of jokes that flop in this but there are far more that work and laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking most lighweight films that pose as comedies try do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense mafia has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than make people laugh the begins on the perfect high note mockery of the opening of casino our hero jay mohr is seen walking from casino and getting into his car subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against backdrop of flowing fire describe the story of mafia is absurd and pointless but will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films lot of casino references inserted throughout along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing movies like this rely on just few things but the most important element is direction abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other an exclamation point in the title and so hold most of the success of mafia his experience he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages wring at least bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants make fun of titanic but it never develops the actors are all energetic helps lot the tone of the mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here he looks like he is having so much fun that he is containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence the swimming pool he is probably the only performer in the cast who manages urge laughter without the help of the material lloyd bridges does decent imitation of brandos godfather while pamela gidley is deadon in fullblown mockery of sharon stone the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that am supposed give examples of things and be specific unfortunately was so constantly blindsided laughter during mafia that cannot remember lot of what made me laugh but that is good sign mafia is so funny that was not even given time apply any of the scenes memory laughed so hard that it shut off my brain know that does not sound particularly complimentary but when watching dumb comedy like this the first thing want do is shut off my brain finally that does this for me,1.0
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce dish not everyones taste but certainly wellcrafted movie possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need it there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways get it all onscreen in two leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and still holding their interest clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who is trying play straight trying improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers flourish and quits winner in this sense the movie is bit of departure for verhoeven who is not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in positive way and we are left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but it is far better than we would been led expect all the negative prerelease publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther experimenting the sociallyacceptable limits moviemaking his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been progression of backdoor access american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic the underlying basic drives and now he is exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for the directors contract contained specific provision that he would not have deliver an rated movie verhoeven had cut several parts of basic instinct get an rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie uses naked ladies as scenery is bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies it is about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist it is about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys and the need escape their power it is about world where sex is nothing and normal human values do not pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc movie is not sexually exciting says great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in swimming pool is not exciting because then we already know his character is callous manipulator if anything it is rape scene victim who is been duped into cooperation you do not make movie about the history of black people in america without using few black actors you do not make movie about world war ii without few guns going off and few people getting killed and you do not make movie about las vegas showgirls without showing few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is legitimate portrayal of rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in town where sex is simply negotiable commodity showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries great effectiveness nomi is played in very good performance elizabeth berkley who gives us solid picture of woman limited talents who is at the end of her rope desperate live life better than the one she is known she has nothing market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not be hooker trying be something better than she seems destined be when nomi realizes she is gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time save the most essential part of who she wants be gina rivera plays molly dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomis entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs verify the value system she will be using for the rest of her life and nomis feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomis decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer reflexively competitive manipulator who is become villainess internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as cross between ava gardner and raquel welch fading talent made bitter selfawareness her character is very well drawn and performed in major scene in hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs follow different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hardworking person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image reality cristal is talented dancer who is compromised her ideals and sold herself be cooperating part of the system exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and does not need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as nice guy glenn plummer plays dancer who is working as bellboy and provides bit of alternate perspective plummers character is the only one in the movie who is maintaining an interest in dance as performing art but even he is succumbed the cult of manipulation plummers character is the closest thing sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacanos cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomis character alteration nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc due language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well do not see way this particular story could have been told well without it and regard it as legitimate exercise in moviemaking but do not go see it if you are not in tough mood the only person it is possible like in this movie ends up in an c on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you would enjoy meeting in person,1.0
it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world claiming the cannes festivals palme dor millionplus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as codirector of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampirefest from dusk till dawn in between he has moonlighted as an actor several decidedly unmemorable performances now much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonards novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown is pretty ordinary crime movie the story starts out slowly develops into twisty affair doublecrosses and triplecrosses and the movie is littered occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire pop tunes and closeups of womens bare feet yet for all of that the production is something of letdown the sheer inyourface exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostlystraightforward chronology of jackie brown does not match up favorably the nonlinear style of tarantinos previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess the narratives and there are not nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around there is samuel jackson monologue about guns jacksonchris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in car trunk and jacksonrobert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jacksontravolta material from pulp fiction but that is about it jackie browns lone innovation is its presentation of crucial sequence from three different perspectives this is not exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawas rashomon and most recently in edward zwicks courage under fire however while in those two movies and others there was legitimate plot reason for the multiple pointsof view tarantinos sole purpose for using it appears be because it is unconventional had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost as result this aspect of the is little more than curiosity for the second picture in row tarantino is attempting revive the career of s icon this time around instead of john travolta it is blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown in one of many nods the most famous segment of griers career tarantino uses s song accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any buttkicking grier is jackie brown flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states she is working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tvs banyon post the necessary then plans shoot jackie if she proves disloyal jackie passes ordells test however and soon the two of them are plotting way smuggle of ordells money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordells perpetually oversexed and druggedout girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his righthand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in samuel jackson but ordell is not nearly as invigorating or compelling character as jules from pulp fiction in addition looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their toughguyswhorarely smile roles bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons look sexy in bikini provide little twisted comedy and satisfy tarantinos foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in part that could have been played equally well any grungy looking middleaged actor the clocks in at several minutes over the twoanda half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself when it comes recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is secondtier effort it is an entertaining diversion but not masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender,1.0
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective looks at wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue reveals who the killer is sure it is been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun one of my personal rules about watching is not how original the is but how it goes around giving its story this rule applies highly kiss the girls there is something psychologically stimulating in wellcrafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made however the whole screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail pull it through well not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much the that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices the filmmakers one that seven lot like this one knew not make was put the name of the killer in the opening credits that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the hidden in my mind was waiting for him appear on screen spoiled the mystery however credit must be given the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the plotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality we are introduced detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero he gets call about woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days this provides the motivation for cross find the killer but we are never given chance establish the relationship between the two and as result we cannot sympathize detective cross however what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes target for casanovawhat the serial killer likes call himself because of these characterdeveloping scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in cell somewhere in the woods remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides break one of them calling out when casanova comes punish her she breaks out and escapes jumping over waterfall after she is found she begins help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive many people will compare this seven another killer starring morgan freeman but presume that the similarities are intentional the screenplay david klass is adapted from the novel written james patterson and yet do not quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes felt that many of the shots were trying too hard impress us sometimes simple shot is the best one however many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well the chaotic and mtvtype cutting gives the audience sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judds character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors morgan freeman is one of todays most powerful and believable actors detective cross is very good character for him although it is just similar one the character in seven because of freemans powerful presence he carries half the himself the other half is carried ashley judd one of todays most promising dramatic actresses in fact her performance is better than freemans if that is even possible her character is more original than freemans and she handles it wonderfully we finally have female character in movie like this who does more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can it cary elwes portrays cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we do not really get know his character either gina ravera gives good performance but again she is not in many of the scenes so as result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the lies on the two leads and they do phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspects of the are quite good director gary fleder does good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also does not handle the suspenseful scenes as better director would have losing lot of tension during many scenes however his credit he does manage terrific first half part of the blame falls on david klass am sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts while this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are onedimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent none of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problems had the movie was the motive of the killer blame this mainly on the casting director because the killers motive is because of rejection from women or so assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girls is rated for terror violence language and suggested sex all the implausibilities of this and the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages thoroughly entertain in fact had the urge see it again just for the performances the cinematography adds lot of mood the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movies rely on the acting pull it through morgan freeman is possibly todays most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt must also say that loved the ending the showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the is not anyway,1.0
i was originally going give the spanish prisoner two and half stars from my first viewing noticed that david mamets was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning from my second viewing however noticed that mamets script was actually masterpiece the spanish prisoner like the usual suspects or chinatown begs for the viewers complete attention miss scene or even small detail and you could miss the meaning of the entire also like the aforementioned films it rewards its viewer for paying attention delivering surprising and memorable ending mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in when he wrote and directed house of games like his past gem the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much or even more than the victim because we were deceived just like the victim we feel strong attachment the main character and consequently are more interested in the mamet has the talent of not completely ending gift wrapped but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end the power that he has in forcing the viewer determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the is over without giving right answer is unique and ingenious the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued after seeing the again noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening his direction is very subtle as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them or think you see all of them the story follows young up and coming businessman joe ross campbell scott who has just created mysterious and lucrative process that everyone is trying get their hands on soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his process through his journey ross meets number of mysterious characters the rich and popular jimmy dell secretary who has huge crush on ross and ross boss mr klein played steve martin rebecca pidgeon and ben gazarra respectively the supporting cast is very solid especially martin who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role the most interesting character in the though was campbell scotts joe ross the characters transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable david mamets script is so interesting because we know people do not actually talk like the characters in the yet we feel so connected some of them his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge this is must see for those interested in solving complex puzzle of movie,1.0

after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction jackie brown seems like something of lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino it is more of hohum heist story characters that speak the tarantino language luckily his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer the story introduces us streetwise black woman named jackie brown pam grier flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination another she works for bottomofthebarrel airline and receives minimal salary but one day she is picked up pair of federal officials including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet and found handsome load of cash and small bag of smuggled dope jackie is working for weapons dealer named ordell samuel jackson who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation soon jackie and ordell are plotting way smuggle through them under nicolet us nose the help of ordells oaf of partner robert de niro and druggedout lady friend bridget fonda also entering the picture is bailbondsman named max cherry robert forster who takes liking jackie and agrees at one point make the situation even more complicated how will not say the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown in numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags filled cash switch hands it is unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there and does not offer anything extremely compelling while doing so there are as always amusing exchanges between characters the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda as he becomes annoyed her constant bickering while making fun of his iq or lack thereof the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie year old white bail bondsman and year old black flight attendant believable chemistry you have got commend the acting jackie brown is seriously draggedout exercise enlivened such fine acting the clocks in at lengthy hours minutes tarantinos talky style manages hold your attention heavily but there are more than few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline also fans of the director should be prepared for lighter side appear jackie brown has four major shootings and two of those take place mostly offscreen so do not be expecting typical tarantino bloodbath you can expect frequent foul language mostly coming way of ordell who much the dismay of spike lee uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary the acting is the glue that holds everything together grier making sudden comeback from her reign in the is more than adequate for the title character in fact she is flatout great another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster who does grand job as max cherry and is perfectly cast in doing so michael keaton makes his presence felt albeit in small but dignified moments and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge speaking of that bridget fonda has relatively little do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe and yet she manages look fairly occupied there is not single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie is lifesaver for mr tarantino the story barely holds together in the meantime and we merely get small tremor whenever there should be defeaning earthquake but oh well jackie brown manages be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work let us just hope that the director has not gone soft on us,1.0

there is thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed sharp and very honest look at us presidential election based on the book written anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he does not actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work keen desire skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up henry as the wouldbe presidents advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaigns eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is similar wag the dog they both are not afraid wipe their noses in the nittygritty and take bold look at something that will never has honesty as virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned fleshing out it is characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough make the more than worth look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you cannot help but feel that these terrific characters are going waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henrys story we are often forced watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary the central plot or even the point of the having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable watch but frequently we have ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable the rest of the but as mentioned before there is thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined farfromoverpowering look at winning the publics opinion although at occasions the may jump around little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is provocative documentation of something so really it is scary,1.0

all those who were offended there is something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch and while this uproariously funny grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste it also demonstrates surprising sweetness in the end american pie is the latest entry the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season must question the studio that releases movie like this the producers are aiming these films at the crowd but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of restricted movie american pie was threatened an nc but after snipping few scenes from the finished product it was given an but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park it is sick perverse and ultimately disgusting not mention extremely funny american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make pact lose their virginity prom night jim jason biggs kevin thomas ian nicholas oz chris klein and finch eddie kaye thomas are quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience be successful in their lives ahead jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base one of his friends replies like warm apple pie of course this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers in jim and freshly baked pie have very intimate moment in the kitchen corner there are many moments such as this in director paul weitz uses gameplan similar the one frequently displayed in mary cause the audience break down laughing in disgusting disbelief american pie is hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage stick it loved the young cast in this movie consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects and you should appreciate their performances biggs is more than enjoyable and chris klein who recently played similar jock in election is obviously young talent on the rise but in teendominated movie the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy of televisions sctv who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father scenes in the familiar fatherson conversations are brought interesting new levels are the funniest moments be found in american pie after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie he tells him i did fare share of that sort of thing when was your age but never used baked goods it is performances such as his and bill murrays in rushmore that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the bathroom incident involving finch and bottle of exlax is something we have seen before if weitz is planning take after the farrelly brothers then this is decidedly unwise move the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber and used greater effect secondly the characters are forced into halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing but at one point in we discover that american pie does have heart of it is own biggs asks his buddies why he is going through so much pressure for something that is not very important anyway and so we realize that while the is expressive about subject that is hardly appropriate it still manages be mature in it is own way,1.0
albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for cheer them up and does so in positive way while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor in albert brooks latest comedy he tells story of troubled screenwriter brooks who is losing his edge as his business partners say in desperation he goes see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been very successful screenwriter in the past he asks jack for some help and recieves word of real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as sort of payment the real punch line however does not come until the end it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from friend or bum in the street the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in hilarious manner speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as screenwriter every time he graces the screen cannot help but start laughing albert has very unique sense of humor that makes him very likeable character the real problem the lies sharon stone she was not likeable at all brooks had the right idea her occupation but she never pulled through in way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stones mishap it was shame that the went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential be very authentic comedy on brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brooks wife she is always nice addition as supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems complete the atmosphere any she is in the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos james cameron and martin scorsese mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary it was just plain hilarious it just adds the satire joke of how directors get ideas brilliant move brooks as mentioned before the is satire much like it is proceeder bowfinger came out few weeks before unlike bowfinger this is not mean spirited that is desperate for jokes it is rather witty and humorous look at bowfinger had it is moments but had quite few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed keep the laughs despite bit of detour the end of the you are glad see good hearty comedy come out of it for once am not fully disappointed because the did not slow down it kept moving even some flaws thumbs up brooks for his brave effort think he will still manage keep his edge around well into the future,1.0

seen february on home video borrowed from chris wessell when it comes modern gangster movies it is really difficult describe and review them without making comparisons other films of the genre andor just using the word routine have always subscribed the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times it is been used before can provide for good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea it is not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes anothers style as it has good layer of authenticity even if its core is tad stale the starts off in typical fashion defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late and the mobsters who inhibit it we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect see in crime films like this somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp younger guy lot of spunk who is not afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages befriend him after lefty was ready kill him it is clear donnie is new the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the deserves credit however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as newcomer the first act works as guided ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original most gangster movies seem be made the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the tries fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable thankfully the does not become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would he is old and exhausted but seems enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal the same employer for over years might be we learn of his accomplishments are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss it is easy sympathize him newell constantly plays up this aspect making it major theme works well in the long run as donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty it is hard tell emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed most of the tells the story of donnies life in mafia creates for many subplots and individual conflicts but does not always seem come together as whole the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar the resonance donnies actual assignment varies he often reports back the feds detail of his progress but it does not always seem have much meaning back home his wife maggie heche is ready divorce him because he is never and the family is suffering since this is based on true story would not doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic my only major complaint is the seems have no final act or at least any real sense of closure climax of sorts does occur but there is little feeling of payoff we get happy ending is good but perhaps sad ending would have been more powerful aside from few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages be solid piece of storytelling and character development it may be routine but it is good and that is respectful,1.0

the human spirit over oppressive adversity pivotal characterdefining moments occurring at sea although the films rather conventional climax does not sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached the it remains foremost finelycrafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia legitimately intrude and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the eschews

all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued this is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras mad city have always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses tremendous comic gift she has always seems have impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant her duplicitous character mischievously flashing glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans cheerfully going over the top it is hilarious watch her who would have ever guessed that she would have the opportunity outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of ms linney is delight in the but it is mr carrey who rules the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes typify his traditional parts but he brings the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it is difficult not root for truman in commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity makes him genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there is an early scene where he is down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags it is almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down play character who is constantly the centre of attention in addition the fine performances the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character sense of sturdy trustworthiness the is immeasurably aided wonderful production design dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic white picketfenced smalltown utopia and burkhard dallwitzs original score technical credits are firstrate all around while the truman show is clearly definitive highconcept it is not exactly dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from secret agent through the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner all the same this is visionary awardcalibre entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous it is abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such scenario perhaps the highest compliment can be paid mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize bit of ourselves in this world,1.0

if beavis and butthead had favorite movie from dusk till dawn would probably be it scripted quentin tarantino and directed robert rodriguez desperado the movie panders the very worst in sex and violence and is incredibly fun watch it starts off as pulp fictiontype crime story criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing convenience store because this is tarantino movie however it is not just case of pull the gun and take the loot it is case of hole being shot through someones hand man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie everything overdone and nothing as it seems clooney and tarantino bring hostage the motel and then hijack an rv family in it harvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly you know you are mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive although she is not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying get and through the mexico border clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet it does its trick the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind never noticing clooney or tarantino once they get mexico it is time wait at the rendezvous point topless bar called titty twister where we are once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of stripper finally after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis drink him the stripper turns into vampire soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back that is right we have come all this way see vampire movie but like everything else tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it his own ends produce overthetop entertainment so we get holy water condom balloons heads rolling quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten vampire and announcing he only has few minutes left before he becomes lap dog of satan the from dusk till dawn dialogue is tarantino hovering between absurd and disgusting as when they are entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister but always entertaining and is huge reason the movie is so much fun watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest clooney keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what do entertain people even if there is absolutely no message or meaning from dusk till dawn pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for reason but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment from dusk till dawn is not the classic of modern cinema that pf is but is does prove you can do good job making really bad movie,1.0

warren beattys bulworth is caustic political comedy that does not attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system some might think this is vulgar and in many ways it is however as loud and raucous as it is bulworth speaks the truth is almost always ugly hear beatty who directed the and cowrote the script jeremy pikser the lemon sisters stars as incumbent s senator jay billington bulworth who has one of the best politician names in cinema history bulworth is democrat and in beattys view he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth has long since succumbed the materialistic pressures of washington instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden was once the calling card of democrats bulworth has become another sellout money hound if he is not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese he is making windbag speeches that start the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of new millennium blah blah blah when the opens it is few days before the primary elections and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become in fit of desperation he takes out million life insurance policy from dirty insurance rep played paul sorvino part of shady lobby deal kill threatening bill in committee and then hires hit man kill him although he does not know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general at compton church he tells the group of africanamericans that they will have no power in the s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than running back who stabs his wife later in particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mixes the elite then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he is there is because my guys always put the big jews on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworths chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in state of constant shock and bewilderment platt has some of the movies funniest scenes as he makes murphy into politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant halftruthtelling and spindoctoring cover bulworths stampede is equaled in its perversion only selfrighteous reporter nora dunn who acts like murphys refusal explain bulworths actions something he really cannot do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he wants live after all and therefore must constantly evade grimlooking assassin be who is trailing him at every turn he hides out in the ghetto complete stereotypical gangsta wardrobe he wears one of his television interviews at this point beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into cartoonish exploration of the black innercity experience bulworth becomes friendly young black woman named nina halle berry who he meets at the harlem church rally she has toughtalking brother who is deep in debt local gangster named d don cheadle of boogie nights who also becomes involved in bulworths campaign some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true but much of it feels like lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense innercity films like boyznhood and menace ii society bulworths chief liability is beattys insistence on having his character adopt clumsy style of rap as his new communication device instead of speaking at political rallies he breaks into kind of rhythmless rap style that is reminder of why almost all hiphop stars are black it is hard tell whether beatty is being humorous being so bad or whether he is actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sounds more run m than snoop doggy dogg makes the seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the innercity lingo and working that into his speeches instead of trying sound like l cool other than that bulworth hits all its targets wry hilarious accuracy the is like letter bomb the democratic party and even if you do not agree beattys liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government it is hard deny the impact the has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary colors opened earlier this year bulworth does not try tiptoe around the truly painful issues that hit close home instead it takes them deadon,1.0
when saw the trailer for this laughed harder than had in quite some time while was therefore pretty well psyched see it was ever mindful that trailer can make even the most mediocre look good am happy say that there is something about mary is not one of those trailer letdowns in fact watching this was quite fine way spend two hours the opens up in flashback at high school in cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller is social reject who cannot seem get date the upcoming prom until he comes the defense of the mentally retarded warren earl brown who is being harassed one of the school jocks it seems warrens sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed teds willingness stand up for her defenseless brother despite very real chance of getting beaten up mary takes an immediate liking ted and asks him the prom ted was just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted has an accident his zipper at every man in the theater will wince and is sent the hospital fast forward the present where ted has cleaned himself up now writes for magazine but has weekly therapy sessions in order deal his obsession of the past years mary whom he has not seen since that fateful day the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon track down his only love however when pat finds mary he falls for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affections there is something about mary is directed bobby and peter farrelly who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedies they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or coworkers think you had such great time watching them their current the farrelly brothers have come up something you will not only enjoy but also will not mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the succeeds in employing pretty wide range of comedic styles from the subtle the ridiculous and while few of the gags might be offensive some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute you will be laughing at something ted says and the next you will be howling at the sight of dog dragging him across the floor of marys apartment one of the great things this has going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he is guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation teds nice fellow and tries do his best but for some reason or another things just do not always work out it is comical but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him come out on top actually have liked stiller since he did short aired on saturday night live back in the mideighties the was like theatrical trailer for spoof on the tom cruisepaul newman the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played john mahoney become bigtime bowling hustler it was parody at its finest more of showed up in the shortlived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late early like the critic aired on abc then fox still mourn that show is cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the although her character seems obsessed perfection in the men she dates and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times however diaz pulls the role off such panache and charm that you can still see why she is got guys just falling over each other be her heck even found her laugh be cute even though thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon does not change and you know it is really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clarks pool house anyway heres another good piece of casting as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries worm his way into marys heart the supporting performances are also good chris elliott has bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who plays marys neighbor magda and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin provides some good laughs especially in scenes her benjilike dog acts as the focal point for few of the funniest moments of the lee evans as marys friend tucker displays flexibility in acting and accents surprises and contributes an interesting plot twist the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there are not any noticeable times where the drags the only problem saw was their use of couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera it is device was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the after that it got little annoying and it is unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be smooth flow fortunately filled sight gags humorous lines and solid comedic acting there is something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater,1.0

after being hypnotized man believes there is ghost in his house the review two lowkey summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year the blair witch project and the sixth sense each has made well over million in north america based on combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising if films box office take were based primarily on its quality stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected for it is as scary if not scarier than the other two writerdirector david koepp has given artisan entertainment the folks who distributed blair witch second creepy hit the story gets going after tom witzky bacon an average bluecollar dad gets hypnotized his wife maggies erbe sister lisa douglas at party while the hypnosis goes as expected the partygoers it triggers something in toms head things begin change around him blinking red lights let off strange hum for example and he fights stay in control of his own senses where these experiences take tom maggie and their son jake cope who tom thinks might have some answers is down dark path that will scare and disturb you david koepp keeps the action localized the majority of the action takes place at toms house or just down the street keeping things at home koepp is able proceed without having resort any clumsy segues montages of driving down roads as we move from one city another etc unfortunately the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted moments of levity humour can take the tension away from scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting several tense moments become completely diffused few misplaced jokes also there are couple of plot developments that are left unresolved though mention them would be give too much away kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and man losing his sanity admirably his total lack of understanding of what is happening him is believable as are the reactions from his wife maggie kathryn erbe is given role meatier and better written than that of most wife who can no longer handle her husband parts while it is still supporting role her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls private club that am not invited where they whisper about things all day long as jake zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense but gets less screen time both children manage the same trick making the audience creeped out their apparent acceptance of the way things are fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes it combines the dread of blair creepy closedin feel thanks cinematographer fred murphy and great performances the whole cast specifically bacon give the fall its first genuine scary if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot bit more this could have been one of the years best,1.0

what look for in movie is not necessarily perfection sometimes movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have will prefer it bettermade that is not as thoughtprovoking the thin red line is flawed but it provokes terence malick returns filmmaking years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war unlike this years saving private ryan dwells on war as necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof the thin red line simply says war is waste while that might seem obvious some only after experiencing the do you realize how profound waste it is saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has great cost the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs one message is not necessarily more correct than the other it just depends on ones point of view in malicks war is set in tropical paradise and john tolls cinematography is beyond lush the setting poses the question why are we fighting in the face of such beauty in saving private ryan the capture of german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether let him go in the thin red line the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place they are just like the americans frightened and angry grieving and praying all that separates them is war the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voiceovers unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious sometimes corny the voiceovers tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary dispensing them malick could have achieved tarkovskian grandeur instead he gets distracting selfconsciousness aside from that malicks direction is stunning the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary sean penn elias koteas and nick nolte give the best performances penn is subtle as sergeant trying hide his humanism koteas is genuine as compassionate captain and nolte startling as colonel whose blood vessels are about burst if he cannot win his battle john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles ultimately however the thin red lines interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure but malick clearly has different things on his mind has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative what malick is working is theme and in that the thin red line is most provoking,1.0

it is hesitance that call apocalypse now masterpiece certainly it had the pedigree be one of the greatest films ever made director known for producing masterpieces ease and some of the finest actors of the the plot an adaptation of joseph conrads heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the was supposed be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war apocalypse certainly has its moments some of are the finest in history the plot is fairly simple captain willard sheen is troubled soldier who came back hanoi for nd tour of duty his mission is simple take boat up cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando extreme prejudice along the way willard runs into series of adventures including one lt col kilgore duvall and strange encounter playboy bunnies willard four person crew finally make it kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as god among the natives willards experiences kurtz take up the last halfhour confrontation and eventual ending the movie is visually breathtaking the battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting murky mood of darkness that is firstrate the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful resonate through the entire movie the journey kurtz camp is quite ride psychosis setting in on almost every character the most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission it is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of movie the scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne the narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz coppola sets about hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd the is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution the problems come when the slows down one of the major scenes in the where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is colossal mess the dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for terrible minutes of the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound the slows down drag sheen seems forever captured madman played brando is lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received brando is in the for no more than minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the visually pathetic the scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief sheen seems adore this man but why the viewers are never told the entire journey is supposed be prelude for stunning entrance of this godlike kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations granted it has its moments are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion brando mumbles his lines in incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be great man this could never be man who inspires hundreds follow him so why do they do it there are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene there are too many questions left unanswered the character of kurtz have satisfying ending the finest scene at the end is sheens escape and his entrace into the temple his rise out of the water the smoke coming off of his slicked head is brilliant seconds of yet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this could have done the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the on the whole is very good it is stunningly flawed expression of for it addresses major issues such as mans mental stamina during bouts of war but one still cannot shake the feeling that this could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for there is too much good material in here not be called masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding,1.0
the verdict spinechilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscarwinning performance from kathy bates geez french and saunders had field day when they set work on parodying this sorry nonbritish readers may not be familiar french and saunders my apologies the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did series of spoofs few years back including alien the exorcist and misery needless say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunders legs but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although have now seen the couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing am still left screaming at the telly in revulsion that may be the most memorable scene but it is certainly not the only worth watching stephen king whose and tv adaptations tend vary in quality strikes gold this simple yet strikingly compelling tale it is nicely crafted psychological horror effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan rescued from car accident annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writers number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for she won an oscar work arminarm as we quickly begin realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as fruitcake or is that fruity as nutcake bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of masterpiece at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times she is rather tragic character and more often than not she is just damned scary this is basically very simple tale but it achieves large degree of eloquence in its simplicity it is an involving engrossing experience and considering it is basically twohander mainly set in one locale it is remarkable piece of cinema there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan oh have not really mentioned caan yet he does good job as the writer who is prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed him and his books but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show along the pig of course anyway the tension is builtup masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense there is the dinner scene where seldon goes nerveshattering lengths poison her wine he succeeds but she knocks the glass over bet you threw pillow at the screen as well in the immortal words of homer simpson doh other nervewracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off town and sheldon starts snooping around the house we cut annie in her car she is on her way home he realises this and tries get back his room cut the car again she is getting near will he make it ok so these sequences are not exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work boy do they work if has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then it is doing something right of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling annie realises her captive has been out of his room and she is going stop him once and for all cue block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and huge sledgehammer and feel ill just thinking about it nasty it all builds up nicely the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries kill the crazy psycho and then we are given one of the most ridiculously overthetop fight scenes have ever seen she gets hit over the head typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just will not die sheldon is not in terribly good shape either if it were not so gorey it would almost be laughable but it is terrifically effective and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked misery is tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller the directing is firstrate and the performances bates in particular contribute making this suitably nightmarish little gem wonderful stuff for more regularlyupdated and tv reviews check out my site http www geocities comhollywoodbungalow,1.0
an indian runner was more than courier he became the message he was carrying what danger is bear message used think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonnamarrying loudmouth but all that has changed now the guy has grown up and that is not all it seems that sean penn has talents both as writer and director if this is any indication one might imagine movie plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper but no this is about real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple penn lets the story unfold at pace dictated the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash the focus of the story is two brothers david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in they were raised tending failing farm and finally becoming police officer viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems be reaction some ancient pain that he cannot name much less resolve the picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared the is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere it is not exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers identify the sickness before it destroys them life seems move forward little faster than they can get handle on their problems this is good without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face in fact am reviewing it because suspect that it may not get much marketing there were perhaps others at the showing saw thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are few freeform sections also work very well the obligatory music seemed little cliche but what are you going dothis movie does take place in the after all in my opinion it is worth fullprice admission,1.0
seen july at the crossgates cinema albany ny theater at m my mom using hoyts cinema cash theater rating very good sound picture and seats it is very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do therefore gone the wind deserves accolades for its ability tell the epic story it does in such crafted intricate and entertaining manner it is crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war this plays major factor in the films success use such historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time verify its accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors potential viewers can story set so long ago be relatable now the confronts all these problems paradoxically not cronfronting them it does not simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant building strong foundation is important all forms of media without what is there build on we are given some backstory here and learn little about our characters especially our main character scarlett ohara leigh beautiful southern belle will of steel cunning wit and tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is have her way no matter what the consequences may be being the most soughtafter woman allows her manipulate men and their women ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious e who will be the one get her food or subtle e getting married just spite someone the man she claims love is ashley wilkes howard modest gentleman who does not seem have the same passion for her as she does for him he is not so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact he is engaged woman personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but does not give her much emotional selfdefense acting catalyst the love triangle and the story as whole is the daper stongwilled cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable he is quite character all right everyone listens what he has say even though he is got bad reputation butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill does not seem exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there is no way the south could defeat the north if war were break out this angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factories do we have food do we have navy all we have is tobacco all true statements and yet the south still insists he is wrong butler is shifty character be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance it is appealing scarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know he is not going stop until he has her but scarlett cannot get past her need for ashley and during scene sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story goes on scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family finding proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies this gives the many opportunities bring in more characters into the epic story some are vital for only few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the in most films only few characters exist for support in background but this is more realistic and believable as it incorporates supporting cast the size of small town and everyone has signficance even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the makes for real sense of time and place the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused avoid having show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken the first half of the depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war fleming is able convey the horror of it all painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene has scarlett working as nurse at military hospital while we hear soldier in the background screaming no not my leg do not cut off my leg another scene shows her simplying trying cross street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning that is more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be as the second half begins the concentrates more on scarlett as completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just spite the tyrany of the north she manages resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has cannot help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set the north after the souths ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the is somehow related the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection each other scarlett continues use her manipulative powers over men get what she wants and because rhett cannot help but want her more every time she tries oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the leaves it up us make this call both have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the we are left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering emotions were authentic and were manufacture all none either way is possible and it is mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings it is safe say most of us will not live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone the wind but it is still masterpiece for its ability give us sense that we have just experienced lifes worth of joy and pain,1.0
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective few years ago have seen as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies like bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations also like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces and the prominent mournfulness of cello on the soundtrack recalls bergmans own use of bach cello suite in an earlier all that is missing is discussion of god is not say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage the swedish master in fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind nonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go the movies in the first place that it takes some effort adjust the films rhythms once the adjustment is made however there are great rewards one such is the chance see life on the screen as it really is though leigh may have adopted some of bergmans stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse crosscutting during married couples strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the is that it eschews any style at all whereas bergman uses artifice as tool expose reality leigh makes the camera mere observer almost as in pbs documentary the effect of this is focus all of your attention on the actors it is tribute everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting much has been made of brenda blethyns performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching fiction that you realize how good she is there are few missteps for one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the this leads certain monotonous tone throughout and occasionally as bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced for all that this longish manages keep hold of your attention it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this in fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it there is even sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well observe nonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart though there is nothing physically horrific make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting turn from the screen needless say it is also very depressing at times but for many of us of course so is life and though the is too honest tack on phony happy ending that same honesty allows it admit that things can also get better,1.0

every once in while sneaks up on me and takes me completely surprise do not necessarily mean in terms of quality rather am referring the mere knowledge of its existence usually know what films are on the way year in advance but two weeks ago had never heard of princess caraboo it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined slip out just as quietly that is shame because princess caraboo is delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing what is more it is surprisingly insightful and provides sharpwitted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england involving young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable speak any english she is taken in goodhearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plans for lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems be and sets out find out the truth about princess caraboo as social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is winner it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is bit too close them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted be heavyhanded he also takes unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes sensation at court in one of the films best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at party hosted the prince regent wonderfully foppish turn comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on timeless quality and makes the an interesting companion piece the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in part that requires gift for pantomime her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is disappointment turning in limp performance as scholar who attempts verify the princesss identity the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo is not given more time develop because the potential seemed be there when it finally does blossom it seems too quick be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem bit slow viewers seeking fantasy romp still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem,1.0

wong karweis fallen angels is on purely visceral level one of the most exciting films have seen in long while unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience root for ordinarily that alone would be enough sink movie but in the case of fallen angels this is not so every shot in this is exciting just look at wong does really interesting things the camera but he does not allow the pyrotechnics completely take over as was the case last years dismal knock off contained shot of foot entering shoe ugh the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle find some meaning in their lives cannot say much more than that as did not really know what was going on most of the time in fact it was not until about halfway through the movie that was able distinguish between each character the constantly moving camera does not really allow for the audience associate any one character we are always kept at distance from these people suppose in order further add the feeling of alienation felt the characters fallen angels is refreshing changeofpace from most films never bother try anything different at least on visual level in fact would go so far as say that fallen angels is more challenging visually than any mainstream have ever seen sure there is directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death but see filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses images is truly something worth celebrating but if wong wishes become legendary filmmaker he needs work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images there were far too many instances during fallen angels in asked myself now who are these people again is this that first couple or the second couple it was impossible keep track perhaps he could let the audience know right away character is introducing them us name cards as in scorseses mean streets that is really besides the point though wong karwei has proven himself through very few films that is he is moviemaker watch let us just hope that he hones his storytelling skills his next few movies,1.0
city of angels is the kind of love story that enjoy the most thoughtprovoking moving and completely unsentimental find it interesting that this has been released the same day as my giant is that is undone completely its wretched sentimentality city of angels is wonderful enhanced interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years it is love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary the story and avoids most of the cliches we are so used seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders wings of desire have yet see wings of desire so am unfortunately unable make comparison of the two have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways makes me glad that this is not ripoff of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present lead the dying heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced take the life of patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called her the angels can make themselves seen humans but they cannot experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants become human so he can feel her that is when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition the human race as side note found messinger be the most fascinating character for can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains seth that it is possible for angels become human seth manages convince maggie that he is an angel know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in she finds out is exceptionally welldone after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be man who can feel this of course is when seth decides take the plunge literally from building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy feel what it is like have split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since love this so much will make minor note that it certainly is not perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done great job them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock he is quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words he is perfect for role like this and at the same time he reassures us he is not bound playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in faceoff meg ryan is powerful enticing and appealinglychirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel what admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is talented man and he knows that story like this is driven the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has tell mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the also appeals the senses in way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images have seen on the big screen hundreds of blackclad angels stand on dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this it is quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of so far all of this adds up that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre it is that relies on character development and imagery get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously,1.0
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined some much larger force within the world or outside of it these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of final destination is the most riveting horrordrama since the sixth sense stylishly filmed and tautly directed xfiles alum james wong the deals several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully teenage characters in accurately written teenspeak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars would not use all the while developing into darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes the lesssuccessful but still suspenseful epilogue at the start of the yearold high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about leave his student french class for field trip paris progressively getting case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being the same as his september birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in plane crash alex grudgingly mutters himself once seated alex suddenly gets horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and teacher are thrown off arguing in the airport lobby alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all passengers including the rest of their classmates as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate alexs best friend tod chad donella wants stand him but cannot because of his fearful parents the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane fellow coworker only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due sudden connection alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken him before is sympathetic and thankful him for saving her life that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better suffice say the does indeed turn into slasher albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones grace the silver screen in years graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in rube goldbergesque manner they manage occasionally be so intense you do not know whether shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away devon sawa rising star who put his physical comedy skills good use in underseen slashercomedy idle hands is even more of charismatic presence here the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival he comes believe he was not meant do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part one scene in he is watching news report on the crash and slowly begins break down is especially realistic and powerful ali larter varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as girl whose life was going well until her father died in convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck an increasingly uncaring mother who married loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather onedimensional the movie is mainly sawas however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles tony todd candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for fiveminute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just little too stilted and campy ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created premise that has never been seen before in this manner and that has the ability both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films if anything it is safe say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again,1.0

robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible godgiven gifts but are able act like ordinary people in the natural he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined be the best there ever was but still acted like humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like nothing more than boyishly goodlooking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting tale of lost love in his latest the horse whisperer based on the bestselling novel nicholas evans redford again plays such character redford also directed the although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in movie suppose the character of tom booker man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating horses was just too good pass up despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes training troubled horses magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having purpose in life bookers talents are taxed into service annie maclean kristin scott thomas new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in horrible accident the accident is filmed gutwrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse pilgrim and causes grace lose part of her right leg annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well leads her booker at first she tries get booker come new york see the horse but that does not work instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs ranch his brother frank chris cooper and his sisterinlaw diane dianne wiest in many ways the is like journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been great american tradition of renewal and it is hard not see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as variation on the classic theme of city vs country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins dissipate annies controlling nature begins relax and pilgrim once again learns trust people redford is just as in love the grand montana country in this as he was when he directed river runs through it six years ago in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much of the films photography is truly elegant and it creates palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated bit shooting the beginning of the takes place in new york mostly cold harsh bluish filters and more squarish aspect ratio when the action shifts montana richardson switches softfocus and natural lighting and the screen widens aspect ratio in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans brief encounter and clint eastwoods adaptation of robert james wallers the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese coscreenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has strong romantic sensibility still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who is being left behind for this brief heartsweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls sam neill he plays the character as decent hardworking man who is good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him he is at risk of losing annie booker not because he did anything drive her away but simply because he happens be normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character it shows booker and robert going into horse pen booker is dressed like classic cowboy hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in baseball cap as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in goofy moment forgets close it behind him it is small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled the scenes between him and grace some of are humorous and all of are tender and true at some point wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously romantic at heart and he brings light touch the erotic moments in the there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially melodramatic tearjerker an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission,1.0

usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock others will mention meg ryan but for me it is not even close janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in right now and it is good thing she is starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull garofalo stars as marcy tizard top aide boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls in an attempt capture the irish vote he sends marcy on mission small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglorys that never moved america unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides the towns annual matchmaking festival things get off rocky start for marcy though she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has stay in has visitor in her bathtub his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed the movie runs into few roadblocks for instance the story is very thin none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo some of the characters like the political aide played denis leary have wandered in from completely different movie think the director realized this and decided throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several closeups of garofalos winning smile the strange thing is that it works garofalos charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one,1.0

know what you did last summer the first highprofile slasher thriller be released after scream and written the same screenwriter kevin williamson is stylish effective horror that became biggest hit of the fall season while scream was more knowing about the genre know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of straightforward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottomofthebarrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the friday the th films well okay jason goes hell was pure hell sit through the starts off four talented aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport c it is the th of july and they will soon be heading their separate ways kindhearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off college while helen sarah michelle gellar who has just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going new york become an actress and football player when the four of them travel nearby mountainside beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting man in the road on their way home distraught and confused they decide they cannot go the police because they will be charged manslaughter so they devise plan throw the apparently dead victim off peer into the ocean in hopes no one will find him julie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it barry switch exactly year later julie still unable come terms what she did reluctantly returns home from college find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out almost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding giant hook know what you did last summer is successful horror for number of reasons the cinematography denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian as it put shadows fog steam and other clever devices add atmosphere the proceedings the characters particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the amazingly deals their broken relationship in few scenes is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort and last the creates few dazzling and scary setpieces that are some of the most memorable have seen in horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her familys store the killer inside her perhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit heche is performance is standout as she is able create full character in only about ten minutes of screen time know what you did last summer could have been great horror movie if not for few problems prinze jr gives performance be desired here and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth also the climax of the almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines luckily the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale includes an expertly crafted jumpinyourseat scare in the main roles hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamers have ever heard she honestly could give jamie lee curtis little competition for the best scream queen and gellar is touching as young woman who in the course of one year finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered although not up the level of either scream movies or the more recent urban legend know what you did last summer is respectable smartlyscripted slasher that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made,1.0
labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers were not thrilled that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed the killing and their leader gets killed riffs the remaining eight led cleons lieutenant swann michael beck must now try get coney island but this time unprotected truce and instead being chased all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed leave as strong impression the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hills idea was warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do their own many people in american cities would be more than happy see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of very good the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there is not much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action social drama territory the soundtrack barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this later subscribed him the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesmanlike leader of gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies,1.0
for those who associate italian cinema fellini and high art the sons room is an inventive subtle alternative written directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement slow is the best description for the at first it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears be normal happy family father and mother both work but still find the time support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities they laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs sigh and soft pat on the shoulder you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome but suddenly the son is found be dead after diving accident the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span though the drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced the process of grieving though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it does not come across as vanity piece one might wish he had not picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni he stars as if only because this makes his characters reactions so predictable what saves it is well written script spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction the potency of the lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due the death of close relative or that remind depressed person of loss you start take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation even better are the role reversals that take place within the household while giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is sense of being on autopilot not only does irene begin take care of her own needs more she will make her parents breakfast in an attempt crack their new shells life around them these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing boundary as how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change respectfully gender issues never enter the picture selfpropelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool separate the family though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at party friends there is never sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search restore sense of balance their lives most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues get the waterworks flowing in contrast the sons room captures more realistic depiction of the effects of death on family graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters it is not the most engaging minutes but it is certainly easy relate,1.0
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is movie that lacks any action scenes at all what does takes place is more based on character development the starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nick and beth have relationship and have decided move from enfield arizona butte montana and who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different carol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend sid is jointsmoking painter that comes repaint their house before the new tenants move in obviously based on stage play the problem the movie is that there is lot of things left out it is not obvious that nick and beth are in love each other the reason why nick was fired from his job is not mentioned and why nick suddenly decide go visit his parents remain mystery when he has not seen them for many years set in small fictional town in arizona was good move since this makes the focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere four young people in house discussing life and the future particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed sid when her fiance nick leaves her not an actress that have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures but will keep an eye on her in the future interesting trivia this was rated in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it,1.0
airplane is considered among many be the epitome of satire filmmaking after all it is brought us one of the best known satire writingdirecting teams even if most people do not recognize the names behind the films they are bound recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots name few but although the zuckerabrahamszucker team was first introduced the kentucky fried movie in airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts in the seventies disaster films seemed be at an all time high films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits there was also series about the disasters that can arise when traveling plane series that spanned the entire decade and so in we were introduced new airplane disaster this time the disaster had nothing do maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had do bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that decision he had make in the midst of war led the death of six er seven comrades unable stop living in the past teds world fell apart he spent his time moving from city city without ever having stable job and eventually as we begin this is getting dumped his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in desperate attempt not lose her ted buys ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her leaves him wallowing in selfpity in the midst of it all something happens someone gets sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people and when the pilots get sick played peter graves kareem abduljabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee wonder of course the main draw here is the nonstop whizbang comedy hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags although had seen this movie few times before was still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character far is the doctor played leslie nielsen he is dry subtle sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the in like this you are not really expecting an elaborate production so one cannot complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny do not know why he was put in there and do not think anybody will find good excuse and when the nears an end it slows down quite bit almost getting old you gotta give it movie that only runs minutes and can feel two hours long aside from that airplane is really topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as spoof classic it would be good choice pop in the vcr group of friends especially if they have not seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em it is synopsis of the basic storyline of the but that is not important right now if you have seen the you will understand,1.0

bob the happy bastards quickie review the mummy brendan frasers stuck in the past again but at least this time he has something better do than quote sitcom lines and try woo alicia silverstone fraser is the lead star of the mummy the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising it is rough adaptation of the and say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages like boris karloff was engulfed in but who cares the movie has sort of swashbuckling quality it you cannot get from oh say godzilla or armageddon fraser plays soldier who gets premonition during battle soldiers in an egyptian ground basically it is little sign from the mummy buried underneath priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out his mistress his plan wake back up and wake her up also making him invincible of course fraser returns the site years later librarian rachel weisz and her brother john hanna along former buddy of his deep risings kevin oconnor and some americans and guess what yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens and wreaks havoc fire flies from the sky flesheating beetles crawl about and well ihmoeteps plan begins unfold ok so it is not really all that new story but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch and the acting from fraser and weisz is not half bad either the action is pretty intense favorite scene the sandstorm and there are few shocking scenes just jolt you horrorloving folks as well no it is no phantom menace beater but if you are looking for solid warmup the summer movie season you will not find better under wraps than the mummy if this does not give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man then nothing will,1.0

apollo is simply one of the most dramatic this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart director and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer more than us million in the states alone this is his most successful effort yet perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles apollo was the second worst accident ever occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident jim lovell hanks the mission commander together his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way the moon suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home if they ever reach it ed harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed fly but was diagnosed measles both delve into their roles superbly audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt come up ideas on how save the astronauts from hurtling into space also there are quite number of real news footages were broadcast during the accident took the entire us nation into days of drama in the special effects digital domain are up standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks filmmusic maestro james horner watch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the bad point though apollo features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script those who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show this is however just minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the you should enjoy it,1.0

perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have do special effects there is no question that actionadventure and sciencefictionaction movies are now judged the character of their light and noise whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is testament the skilled use of special effects and its ability enhance movies story unlike many scifi movies promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail deliver on that promise the matrix is carefully constructed special effects event it runs minutes in length and employs countless number of computerized tricks range from gimmick grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length contrary popular trend the matrix commits itself being spectacle of light and sound in this regard the movie is something like card sharp its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of far more innovative visual approach but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience such high degree that actual content is irrelevent the viewers do not care about what the matrix has say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells fastpaced albeit frequently revisited story as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy only select group of individuals knows of the real world and particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led ultracool morpheus laurence fishburne morpheus and his crew recruit computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace earth the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary bright and airy the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add the roles for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie group of agents created the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves is not required say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time be so damn cool supports in carrieanne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual one of the best comparisons thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise would have worked from different approach the alex proyas was far more dark and introspective requiring bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed construct thrillride motion picture little abandon and much noise the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun,1.0
let me open this one confession love cop movies adore them such an unwavering near foolish passion that was actually one of the first in line see one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven was it any good well just about as good as baldwins steven seagal impression for those have confused the answer is resounding no now let me clarify do not love just any cop movie am not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the and now slowly gulp returning thanks jackie chan and chris tucker am partial those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these films come along just about as often as george bush makes cogent point so whenever true cop movie does hit multiplexes come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movies that transform me into moron willing shell out for movie called one tough cop actually sounds lot like wiseguy spinoff no truth is am sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches yes it is all very corny and awfully boys clubish am guessing is precisely where these feelings come from as little tots us boys are brought up create our own wars gi joes enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos as an adult my tastes have not changed all that drastically sure can get cerebral high from the emotional complexities of krzysztof kieslowski but still delight at the promise guy could potentially bring now what if it is the cops whore the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the shifts from gritty undercover cop drama courtroom drama subgenre loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar remained completely and utterly involved the stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up the level that brad pitt currently resides at since was hatched mere two years prior the release of prince of the city cannot provide an answer as why it did not though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat would guess that it probably has something do quite few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct video purgatory williams is talented leading man who did not make it where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished direct video hell here the actor is given role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico also directed lumet williams plays danny ciello member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means get the job done the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies gain access the big wigs and in order obtain the info they seek they sometimes have provide the junkies the junk of their choice danny has done this and though he is fairly honorable guy who took the job in order do good his intentions have gotten bit skewed along the way he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way go about getting it is talking internal affairs who then convince him go undercover as double agent he does so one condition he will not rat on his partners right away we know that that is exactly what he will have do and watching the movie build that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep how can one not be moved the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such risky position prince of the city takes all this and charges it perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction old pro sidney lumet as well as handful of intense performances most notably treat lumets greatest contribution the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action his scenes transition rapidly from one the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment character stops yakking lumets worst tendency is one that many makers especially oliver stone tend overuse he relies little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order ratchet up the tension this is not as much problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumets most recent cop lawyer endeavor movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for drink or something the most recent completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in that runs for minutes not one dull spot some of the formula pictures like the best are the most simplistic often forgets how easy it is make these kinds of pictures even tolerable of course cop movies are not popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than stall the action and demonstrate that our hero is not gay the lame comic relief character who is never funny and on and on for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is back the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops the lawyers the junkies there is great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he is about go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing this is scene that would never make it into michael bay even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in hushed raspiness straining get the words out he is lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not most but it sure made my night and in sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it is nice see that someone is paying attention the little things,1.0

bill condons gods and monsters is fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since was unfamiliar of whale prior viewing the there is no way know how accurate the is but suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations whale who fought in wwi and then went on become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age quit filmmaking once homosexual scandal broke out involving him as the tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in a became infatuated the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer him as in the dirty old man in one of the opening scenes young enthusiast visits whales home interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton pose for him for painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and does not really think much of this much the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for downfall since whale starts grow deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion his life as he begins seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of director who was forced become somewhat of an outcast due his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed be referred as motion picture director rather than horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends party boone being his guest held director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life as played brilliantly ian mckellen james whale comes off as sad but dignified man and person who was not afraid stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true himself he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as possible friend or someone he can talk while it means so much more whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in deadend job as gardener of peoples homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is goodlooking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen him since whale lives only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture few small elements hold the back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is little thin and the structuring of the onagainoffagain friendship at the films center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds in lesser hands this setup might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the be much more than this also subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and waitress working at bar effectively played lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the was not going follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed bill condon who sense relates or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the also plays as tribute fine man who met an untimely end walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is sad testament when persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life ironically enough is no one elses business in the first place,1.0
i must admit that was tad skeptical of good will hunting based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the in the main character will hunting matt damon an mit janitor in his early twenties is discovered be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight the only problem is that will is tough street kid who is had his share of runins the law and before long he is being hauled in for assault after parking lot fight professor lambeau stellan skarsgard who had brought up the math problems in his lectures tracks him down and strikes deal the police will is be released provided he works lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff but good will hunting rises above its fairly mundane premise deliver poignant and clever drama conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire robin williams lambeau wants get will use his brain while sean wants him listen his heart both of he has been largely neglecting will finds that the former is much easier than the latter so much so in fact that he gets bored it and grows increasingly resistant lambeaus attempts recruit him into the academic lifestyle he also has his share of problems his girlfriend skylar minnie driver an mit student who is moving california at the end of the school year and would like reluctant will come her what makes good will hunting work so well aside from the strong performances especially from damon and williams is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life the scripts sympathies seem lie more sean mcguire than lambeau but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong lambeau while he may seem little cold at times is still written well enough that we like him as character even when we are not sure if we like what he has say and sean for all his warmheartedness has as lambeau and later will point out not lived up his full intellectual potential either the therapy sessions turn out be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will wills reaction this situation and the way in he slowly becomes more receptive skylar and sean is presented in believable fashion and in way that forces the audience consider all the characters opinions rather than setting up an obvious right and wrong side and beating them over the head it for such an extraordinary character good will hunting presents itself as remarkably ordinary it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman character whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar those that almost everyone faces at one time or another this gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama having the government kidnap will use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation good will hunting also has its share of fun humor such as when will in an early therapy session pretends be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture and in the one scene in government agents do in fact appear will blows them off hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa wills relationship his friends most notably chucky ben affleck is usually rather amusing if somewhat crude the has uses of the word was most likely the reason for its rrating and lends itself well the development of wills character add all this the fact that good will hunting even manages pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental and you might be wondering why have not given this four stars well for one thing no matter how well damon and affleck who wrote the screenplay and director gus van sant pull it off the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original there are also few scenes that did feel bit formulaic including one that was supposed be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions still good will hunting takes its premise lot farther than thought it would and is definitely one of the better personal dramas have seen in the last few years and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of films,1.0
a cinematic version of one of john irvings novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested rather than strictly based on the book suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according garp sold the rights his novel prayer for owen meany the disney machine for million but would not grant them permission use either the title or any of the character names that is an odd decisionirving claims it is protect both himself and the novelbut it is one that does not unduly harm the finished product irvings books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boycalled simon birch in the versionwho is uncommonly small in stature and possesses highpitched falsetto voice like strangled mice simon believes himself be gods instrument placed on this earth somehow effect gods plan simon is played ian michael smith who suffers from rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally smiths debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over functionsmiths acting abilities are limited at best another drawback is that in the book simons condition is described the way irving describes any of his charactersin careful loving detail watching simon birch however creates different feeling altogether the audience is forced into voyeuristic relationship the character surely something irving would not have intended simon himself tends be too cute and irritating combination of smiths rookie status as an actor and the precocious oneliners he is forced deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the films director and screenwriter fortunately simon birch is not the real star of the that bears his name simon is more of catalyst allowing his costars shape the story and the actors who fill those roles turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the from an obsequious manipulative destiny first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simons best friend joe mazzello turns in wonderfully layered performance for year old ripe laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joes single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben david strathairn and jan hooks play the towns reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set the others there is even surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from well that would be telling perhaps suggested the novel is the appropriate way go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simons extraordinary life the also changes the books ending one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simons lot the flavor of irvings original novel remains howeverthe passions friendships and insecurities that come change of seasons the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there,1.0
