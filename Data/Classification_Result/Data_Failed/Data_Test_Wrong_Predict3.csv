capsule much anticipated readaptation pierre boulle novel comes screen dark little dreary lots chases fighting very little intelligence visually there much like about version approach take adventure after style gullivers travels treat action makes without much center pierre boulle author bridge river kwai wrote planet apes k monkey planet novel social satire reads lot like fifth book gullivers travels humans discover planet which roles apes humans been reversed unlike roles horses humans jonathan swifts island houyhnhnms novel moves somewhat slowly create some suspense revealing all things most fans know true about nature planet seems me there also statement about human cruelty animals perhaps just looking when rod serling adapted novel into released added number serling touches familiar episodes twilight zone changed ending make more serlingish final irony original version has become history without there could never been planet apes series can surmise only serling ran into serious script problems how handle tricky question language book apes had their own language human eventually learned language could been done would required entire subtitled nonapespeaking serling avoided having apes speak english course there some justification end justifying why apes spoke english may even been inspiration surprise ending serling never tackles allimportant question why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise apes speak own language language they had no opportunity ever hear few viewers questioned serious plot hole however has become well respected cinema history partial credit least should go jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score goldsmiths best if best when films success called sequels filmmakers turned up violence they added wellintentioned though very subtle political messages about what happening united states while first had little shooting guns what there seemed little half hearted second beneath planet apes there good deal more violence point series had lot violence chases series concluded battle planet apes now director tim burton tries hand adapting original book again those thought version very faithful book burtons new version even less faithful first does really reverse roles humans apes has them both intelligent articulate races battling dominance planet currently hands uh make paws apes could good story too planet apes mission impossible films so many other cinematic homages third quarter last century title makes promises filmmakers no intention honoring leo davidson mark wahlberg worlds most expressive actor works space station increasing intelligence usefulness apes then convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion drops him alien planet yes survives storm then no storm perfect quickly finds greatly any surprise shows planet apes rule humans drool everybody talks language they talk earth english apparently does even occur leo there mystery needs explained about fact does occur leo apparently did occur tim burton either heart real horror both just assumed if apes were going talk language they would speak would english any case having talking race dominating another makes look humananimal relationships more masterslave relationships outside sudan few other countries less relevant topic leo captured used slave also discovered ari played helena bonham carter ari attractive ape close ties high political power she bent making world better place perhaps previous draft script she called hilari any case makeup stifles her usual pout carter just about attractive she has ever been she may want consider become her standard look point forward long before leo escapes some human only couple sympathetic apes further abandonment source material chase severely limits interplay ape human examination eachs place reversed society each important book we cannot see how society works because most screentime society has broken down we see humans either separated apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones almost every turn miscalculation characters so lacking empathy value difficult ones place much emotional investment they basically chess pieces viewer has little reason root them win script had little subtlety lines like never met ape did like least we cared what happened taylor main character most what has offer visuals visual work spotty generally nicely done except so much takes place night or fog tends limit close looks makeup general seems much improved makeup team led rick baker instead john chambers did version chambers makeup jawdropper realistic enough almost believable flexible enough show emotion chambers good if anyone had chance best him would baker today audiences higher expectations bakers visualization really improvement these visuals work nicely what does work wire assisted leaps some apes make they look like they were inspired physics defying leaps crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some best scenes apes running into battle looking like they ape posture when they start flying through air effect lost final visual problem frequently shows its budget what should spectacular battle scenes camera shows us only small group people closeup since days lon chaney boris karloff few actors crossed over stardom role required heavy makeup actor has shot paul giamatti lines so good most silly jokes delivers them very well always watchable actor has yet made stardom apetrader limbo overemotes overcome ape makeup does very well doing so makes himself most interesting thing screen probably best thing conjures up memories peter ustinovs performance spartacus injoke there several lines script borrowed old ape played charleton heston becomes allusion first itself danny elfmans score has nice primitive feel jerry goldsmiths tour de force score real classic score whole will remembered when forgotten rate remake scale scale,0.0,1.0
