the last of vampirefilms offers plenty of blood and gore but beyond that nothing jack crow james woods is professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican his and his mens mission is clean the earth from vampires they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered but one has always escaped them valek thomas ian griffith the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation the black cross the cross in their possesion the vampires will be able walk in the sunlight after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth have never liked john carpenter and his style after seeing this my opinions have not changed john carpenter remains john carpenter however because of the films selfirony black humour and fascinating cinematography would say that it is his greatest achievement in long long time neither the synopses or carpenters direction are original but there are some things that are interesting the directors negative view on the catholic church for instance at the end of the it becomes clear that cardinal alba maximilian schell has simply used crow and his team find valek so that he would gain eternal life otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool drinking smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere set in new mexican dessert he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness more than anything in this this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil the cinematography gary kibbe is probably the films greatest achievement music composed john carpenter himself is at times effective the special effects and makeup are likewise worth notice when it comes the cast in an intellectual like this casting is the last problem everyone can scream and swing the axe but here james woods is suprisingly convincing he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter who lost his family the breed of evil woods is constantly overacting really saves the from falling into the trap of serious self importance daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crows loyal partner the other cast members are struggling because the does not take itself too seriously it stays afloat still it is like most vampirefilms mediocre experience,0.0
i am not sure who the genius is who came up the idea of comparing disturbing behavior scream maybe it is because they are both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd guess includes me but this is not the next in line the scream flicks as well as the know what you did last summer soon be flicks it owes less halloween and more kafka and orwell in my book makes for more interesting feature and it should have been this is basically rehash of the stepford wives the great never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as have been told bunch of women who are programmed be perfect housewives or something like that behavior starring katie holmes of dawsons creek deals bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed be perfect teenagers suckups preppies it actually at least me sounds like it would work and scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things do in denver when you are dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off the right amount of frights and satiric wit alas it is not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies potential that blow it remember called white mans burden dealt reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing it is potentially brilliant premise heres another one it could be brilliant satire on how teenagers need go through teen angst in order find themselves it is stage and this does in fact realize that it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly now it just needs work as it does not it is too sloppy and too contrived it paints bleak portrait of high school life then lets it lie it brings us bunch of scary monsters who are all bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at s diner drinking milk shakes then gives it cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal is not it scary enough that they are like this and cannot the real terror in the town be that you could be next be just like them not that you could be next die the introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they are not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who is having trouble at home because he has not gotten over his brothers ethan embry in quick flashes so you do not recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawsons creek who is chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who is the most interesting because he is the only character who is given some dimension in the films best scene he introduces steve every single clique nailing each ones fetishes and hangups and it is the best scene in the movie because it is witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this is not gavin suspects there is something awry the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence steve he is only treated as typical raving conspiracy buff here we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens him but he may have saved this from being the dreary dull that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor the only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor played william sadler as retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems be but really we do not care anyway probably should not mention that this was directed david nutter who is works for the xfiles because that would probably tarnish his reputation like the show he is good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating general creepy feel most of this is shot at night and dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works but what this is not so good at is coming out good payoff he keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just do not get the hell out of there think what happens gavin is proof enough that there is something rotten in the state of teen angstdom what this needs be is lot longer lot more colorful and lot creepier if the best villain they can come up is guidance counselor played bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying pay the rent who still thinks he can get away it even when most is revealed then they need come up tougher smarter villain if he is so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who could not figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in couple minutes the runs about or so minutes just needs work on these things and become lot less sloppy at such short running time and such lame boring characters as these it is pretty much obvious that leaving this leaves horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth especially mine,0.0
in the interest of being generous want start this review the scene that liked in meet joe black sir anthony hopkins playing superrich media mogul has gathered his family around him for dinner his oldest daughter played marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him three superbly decorated little cakes are supposed be scale models for his big birthday cake the daughter asks hopkins pick the one he likes hopkins frustrated the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man in his position would do he punts whichever one you like dear he says and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do she cries liked that scene for two reasons first the cakes looked really cool second it was perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people act meet joe black is chockfull of odd performances people doing things for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours boot it is easy watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but it is even easier sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess know my audience had problems the movie because they thought it was comedy case in point everyone should know now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie however the first we see of him is as young lawyer in coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani it is not clear from the movie whether you need law degree become the angel of death but it makes certain kind of sense it should not take long for the observant moviegoer realize that bad things are about happen mr pitt and indeed they do after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished well when that happened the audience howled laughter and continued laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous so if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny encourage you go see meet joe black immediately anyway the deceased lawyers body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role the idea is that death given the pen name of joe black so as not disturb others wants take holiday and experience the world if this were not we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who is wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and does not know how act in our society it also does not help that the character of death is written so inconsistently he claims be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try get your travel agent book that one he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois he knows everything about some characters nothing about others and as played brad pitt he is not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing he is just there it is as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty it is as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie have used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately contrast pitts performance this years best angel performance nicolas cages in city of angels where pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant cage struck instant chemical sparks costar meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cannot see beyond pitts good looks the movies other top name is much better actor but that does not save meet joe black sir anthony hopkins is not given much better material work unfortunately he plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil hopkins is marked for death due bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world of course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder but have wonder and in this movie you have very long time wonder how you or would act in similar situation especially if you or were multimillionaire hopkins pretty much goes the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated am sure stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and am asking myself why movies about death should encourage you live life the fullest is what am going do now go spend time your family go volunteer for local charity heck go take nap do not go see meet joe black because all it will do is move you three long hours closer death curtis edmonds no children have ever meddled the republican party and lived tell about it sideshow bob,0.0

can horror movie truly be called horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements think not but that is what children of the corn issacs return wants us believe the sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is far the worst date unlike the other five chapters children of the corn is confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary the follows hannah natalie ramsey teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her st birthday what starts out as daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults murder that is about all that is understandable in the as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah fulfill his prophecy and this is supposed make sense really from the start the is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing do what seems the main focus of the the runs at short minutes but it seems be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn issacs return excruciatingly boring plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklins unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the reaches its conclusion everyone and everything involved children of the corn issacs return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along director kari skogland should crawl under rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash the bottom line horrible horrible horrible another attempt revive this worn out genre falls flat and what is that title the devil has nothing do whatsoever this let us pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current series one of the worst horror films in years,0.0
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse it is hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got million what is it matter him once again arnold has signed do another expensive blockbuster that cannot compare the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth impregnate woman robin tunney happens every years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself the help of trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing let the devil take over the world parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in dogma yes the is that weak but it is better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like star anyway this definitely does not seem like an arnold movie it just was not the type of you can see him doing sure he gave us few chuckles his well known oneliners but he seemed confused as where his character and the was going it is understandable especially when the ending had be changed according some sources aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films am sorry say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days speaking of action where was it in this there was hardly any explosions or fights the devil made few places explode but arnold was not kicking some devil butt the ending was changed make it more spiritual undoubtedly ruined the was at least hoping for cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again was let down also do not know why the took so long and cost so much there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget the budget should have gone into better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom it is pitiful see how scripts like these get bought and made into movie do they even read these things anymore it sure does not seem like it thankfully gabriels performance gave some light this poor when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you cannot help but feel that he looked like devil the guy is creepy looking anyway when it is all over you are just glad it is the end of the movie do not bother see this if you are expecting solid action flick because it is neither solid nor does it have action it is just another movie that we are suckered in seeing due strategic marketing campaign save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience,0.0
i still cannot figure out why people went in droves see this movie now before you go assuming am some sort of high brow snob who cannot appreciate little dumb humor let me say that love cheap humor thought there is something about mary was one of the funniest films that have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of low brow adolescent humor can be lot of fun the problem the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent there is no humor component wanted like the waterboy really did think only laughed maybe or times throughout the entire movie actually smiled couple of more times on top of that not great record for minute the problem the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies those responsible for this mess seem think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is substitute for actual funny material nothing could be further from the truth as matter of fact sandlers idiot voice started get on my nerves at points in this it is really shame too because this had the potential be very funny personally believe that sandler is probably very talented comedian it is just that so far he has not been able find the right showcase his talents if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry sandler plays yearold somewhat mentally challenged waterboy for college football team the teams somewhat mentally disturbed coach henry winkler realizes that his waterboy has great deal of pentup rage if harnessed properly would make him force be reckoned on the football field you can figure out the rest from here sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes football star as said the had great deal of potential the idea was decent one but the main potential of this movie is result of the cast all of whom are very good just hamstrung really really lousy material even sandler annoying goofy voice and all has enough charisma and natural comedic ability overcome some of his bad material even as unfunny as his character is still found myself rooting for him throughout the but it is the supporting cast that feel most badly about if their material had been just bit better this could have been such funny movie fairuza balk plays sandlers leatherwearing bikerchick love interest and does great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time winkler is great as the coach who uses coaching for dummies style book help him get through games the real standout though is kathy bates even some of the worst material of her career deal she is still treat watch in her role as sandlers overprotective and overbearing mama even the performances of bates and winkler there is absolutely no way would recommend this movie although get the distinct impression that without them this would have ranked in negative numbers for me is sad because cannot really put my finger on particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became it is obvious that those involved specifically the actors tried very hard make what they thought was going be funny movie it is just too bad that percent of all of the jokes fell flat,0.0
gordie boggs arquette aptly cast as moron as he is one and his best friend sean dawkins scott caan the son of james caan should not be reduced garbage like this are two losers from wyoming no jobs and no girlfriends who look up world championship wrestling champion jimmy king terribly casted oliver platt as he is everything they are not they finally get see him live and he is screwed out of his title the evil ruthless promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff whose name was written all over the role gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him but drunken ignorant southerner who is as irritated these two lunkheads as bob newhart was larry darryl and darryl they sneak him back onto wcw tv after sinclair agrees book him in steel cage match in las vegas at wcws next payperview against his rival diamond dallas page if he wins king gets his title and his career back plus one million dollars wcw president eric bischoff knowing his promotion was desperate bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks the far superior world wrestling federation came up the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw he was then fired and rehired two months ago but the time he would left they had already been contracted do the and bischoff could not play sinclair in itself is for the best as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans he thinks of them as young dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real that is why he does not take the fans into consideration when he books nitro or payperview have news for you eric no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough believe that professional wrestling is not for show unless they are four years old this is you know not bischoff will try cover up criticism like that saying it is comedy but have no doubt in my mind that if this had been dramatic rockystyle it probably should have been professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be comedy gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling shadows documenting wwf owner vince mcmahons doublecrossing of bret hart will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready rumble that it is basically ripoff of that films storyline the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect you can tell titus sinclair is supposed poke fun at vince but any selfrespecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired bischoff than vince and that vince did what he had do bret hart all of these aspects of the needless say seriously offended me as wrestling fan another thing found disturbing about the was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan would not it have been easier bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclairs insistance hate that cliche the world wrestling federation would have made better they are the promotion everyone cares about they are winning the ratings they have better wrestlers and they take their fans into consideration and do not treat fans like morons so vince how about movie,0.0

it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies offensive subject matter than make movie about guy split personality it is exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care the wind get laugh jim carreys signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out levying complaints against the brothers new before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just could not take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie is not funny it is not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped his wife for midget limo driver decides bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable muster this guy is not above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in he is been insulted or holding little girls head underwater because she refused stop jumproping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the runs off its tracks some have suggested that this is not problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor does not require plot work they are wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort there is something about mary outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier was not funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleightofhand trick they would have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene contrast seems have been made folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they have not come up way make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy the plot carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who is in more trouble than anyone knows back new york has an ending that is entirely predictable from the getgo think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage do anything you have not already expected them do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared the curveballs the farrellys are used throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value it is no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language an entirely toopleasant smile on his face but the end of the they are still doing the same schitck it has not been elevated another funnier level and it has not been dropped either that is too bad because it ceases be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought be more focus on how other people react charlies new personality and on how charlie deals the consequences of hanks actions this does not really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they do not have any opportunity be surprised it the throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script does not go anywhere it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he is left nothing much do here except contort himself in manner similar steve martin in all of me it is great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey does not pull any stunts we do not expect him pull and the farrellys script does not give him anything else pull the situations in he must perform the roleshifting are not set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellwegers irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled irene is nothing in particular as the never makes clear whether she is ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing latch onto as the only sane person in the chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise it and stop being shocked but do not believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they will rebound just fine even after that happens though will still consider me myself irene be highcaliber misfire,0.0
there is scene somewhere in this where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy this is funny the first time just ecause it is but funnier as the goes on since it is totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane probably read it outlined it and then wrote this it is like they took the subgenre of the disaster pic can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters yes the poseidon adventure is crap but it is fun ecause of all the stupid eccentric characters and earthquake my god earthquake has got be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping genevieve bujold volcano takes semiintriguing yet stupendously inane plot volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only it is in dare say it a and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it they are just stupid and the actors are all good ones tommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and member of the men in black my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer anne heche is good indy actress don cheadle stole the disappointing devil in blue dress from denzels feet and gabys one of the few good teenage actors but they get nothing do but act dumb and scream at what is going on they do their best god bless them but they are all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he is the greatest part of the there is no real suspense here ecause you do not care about anyone actually was rooting for gabys character get killed so tommy lee jones would not have keep saving her he did it like thirty times and there are no interesting sites in a that we see get destroyed part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever in independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up the aliens that was cool watching really fakelooking magma plow down the street is not okay so the films not devoid of merit as already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best and there is this really moronic scene looks cool john carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on subway car save people but the lava comes and surrounds it he has one guy who is wounded and could make it he could throw the guy and jump and still survive but no he has go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava heres the cool sight he melts heres the dumb part of it he somehow manages throw the man safety as his legs are melting cool sight no logic but cool sight the volcano erupts twice and for some reason the ends there they are not worried about it eruting again they just go home their toppled homes but tell the truth was glad they did not go on was hoping the was over after the first eruption ended my god it was actually painful sit through this little minute long have not seen dantes peak but have heard it is masterpiece compared this if you want see cool disaster flick that is inane but interesting rent the towering inferno steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent j simpson he saves cat if you want waste your time watching boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this but warned you,0.0
the yettobereleased krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as family comedy but buyer beware this movie cannot make up its mind is it family comedy vulgar references both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next them or is it an adult comedy approached such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort either way unbalanced is the word stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort the premise is catchy widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss has spent the past two years getting over the death of his wife neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses now it is time show what he is achieved in those two years and he has absolutely nothing show for it fabricated tale of studying previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous grant was spent on trips mcdonalds but when his discovery becomes the latest craze among colleagues the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe he must create it the aid of his three children the headstrong teen shelly natasha lyonne of everyone says love you the slightly younger mickey gregory smith and the nineyearold edmund carl michael lindner the shelmikedmu tribe named from the first half of each childs name is born and videos quickly produced in krippendorfs backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe despite the professors wishes the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows due in greatest part veronica micelli jenna elfman an overly vivacious and voluptuous anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorfs main assistant hungry for recognition micelli sets up interviews lectures etc in an effort make this the biggest sociological event in history sure fire way go down in the history books krippendorf on the other hand is seeing himself go down jail cell corridor not in history books and each new lecture he must come up something impressive unleash about the tribe mating habits domestic structure etc thru fumbling improvisation and often some quick thinking from his oldest son krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe on the opposing end is krippendorfs arch rival ruth allen lily tomlin an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on mission disprove the existance of the nonexistent tribe it is cute idea and approached more subtle and mature style krippendorfs tribe could have been real winner sadly the mostlymisfired toilet humor overly comical musical score bruce broughton and sugar coated sentiments all the key ingredients of family comedy just are not the right tone for this cut that crap out add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you have got good start at the state it is in now you have got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs doubtfire meets dumb dumber and that is not concoction anyone should be overly anxious try the overall product here is highly forgettable cup of average few laughoutloud moments and great big gap in between them most of the characters are surprisingly twodimensional and the only one who seems exhibit any real acting effort lyonne seems go greatly unappreciated director todd holland has gone about making this in all the wrong ways it is stuck in limbo between disney family fare jungle jungle and potentially hilarious adult comedy fish called wanda it is this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down grade and it is brutal drop strong warning parents forget the impression given advertisements do you want take your kids that has woman asking man if he finds her attractive merely because she is holding his penis yes it is put that bluntly just be warned this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects be brought up in the and others might not be as tame,0.0
it is been hours since returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission mars and can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar why the movie is shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto flimsy screenplay somehow manages leapfrog the great promise of space opera instead shooting for the angle of feelgood science fiction drama more akin space odyssey got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon but no mission mars certainly is not one large action sequence about colossal disaster this is supposedly thoughtful familyfriendly space flick in the apocalyptic excitement takes back seat visual elegance and uplifting drivel you have been warned of course crafting tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see apollo for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve pull it off when he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission impossible the director has the ability create sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally of course there is also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities all of makes me want call de palma the most talented hack in that term may be too harsh but if were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient if were gary sinise would not touch de palma foot pole sinise is wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham am sure he would not want risk the embarrassment of third collaboration the academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission mars oops forgot mention the year after barbecue gettogether for the astronauts we cut luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet suddenly towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed sand tornado appears and creates whirlwind of suction for some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly admire this as if it were lovely piece of art the team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able send one final transmission and may still be alive immediately second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell are dispatched rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars let us put the secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there it is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that trip mars takes roughly six months am not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind mm did not capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia instead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship what happened during the five months prior this did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes still there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the timeframe involving fuel leak depalmas direction is quite good in these scenes although the score ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space cmon there is few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese sad realization that causes me sigh out loud it is colossal bummer that mission mars is poorly assembled and laughably written dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists as mentioned before anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going feel savagely disappointed maybe even cheated after the unbelievably hokey final shot the words the end somehow adding insult injury few audience members made the effort boo and hiss at the screen others muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez that sucked okay it did suck but you have show the actors some sympathetic mercy after all they do pretty well sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as loving nasa couple and funnyman oconnell well he has couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive so golly where did this mission go wrong looking back on the appalling experience would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have while watching mission mars my suggestion would be immediately abort or better yet do not even strap yourself in for liftoff,0.0

the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john mayburys love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon as always jacobis acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque the movie convincingly argues that francis played jacobi was completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude when interviewed fawning talk show host francis calls his style chance brushstrokes starting burglary of franciss flat the uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from cheap horror movie the camera shots are heavy on the avantgarde angles lots of wideangle closeups and distorted shots filmed through coloredglass reflections the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story the result being sterile examination of lonely and vain man daniel craig in lifeless performance plays the burglar and boxer george dyer when francis lays eyes on him after the breakin francis promises not call the police if he will stay for sex he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man whom he shares bed he thinks that franciss paintings have no bloody use and the movie presents no counterargument writer maybury barely outlines franciss character and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain complete enigma we learn little of george other than franciss reason for liking him georges amorality and innocence franciss love of sadomasochism is shown early and often boxing is such marvelous aperitif for sex he reflects george on the way watch boxing match as the fighters head is sliced open heavy blow the camera cuts gleeful francis whose own head is soaked the flying blood francis appears be in complete ecstasy another of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities as the carnage mounts we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience in that tries obsessively shock one dream sequence portrays family in car accident franciss mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother the father and the boy sometimes the script throws us tidbits of franciss wisdom illuminate little while merely sounding insightful am optimistic nature am optimistic about nothing loneliness is my only true companion we learn more details about franciss makeup techniques than about the man himself he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth full of metaphorical interpretations the films best scene occurs late one night when george has get up go the bathroom mistaking franciss picture of toilet for the genuine article he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly like parody of bad art house movie love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling the end the audience has not learned any more than it could have in threeminute sketch love is the devil runs the is not rated but should be considered nc for violence profanity graphic sex nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers,0.0

spawn may be somewhat of an older in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who has not seen it will finally get see it that is if they see it but managed catch it before it made it is way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing it was not the worst of year any means it is not even on the top of the worst films of the year but it did manage top the bottom five of the bottom ten in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of list the only reason it does not come in lower is thanks the special effects might actually have been some of the best of the year performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy in fact this shows no signs of attempting avoid campiness even the editing seemed boast campy quality do not know how explain that one it was not exactly choppy but something about it seemed well annoyingly unprofessional john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite he is the only character who provides the audience any laughs that can honestly be called intentional but the main problem found spawn as most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring would not even say there was climax the sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing conclusion never too soon the movie did conclude in very simple disappointing way even though it is one of the shorter movies have seen this year it is one that would definitely not want subject myself sitting thru again like said the special effects are the only reason that this should have any sense of pride no matter how small was impressed the opening sequence so long as did not allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing get me and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes looked quite bit like modern video game who knows if spawn the video game was not part of the plan from the beginning keeping in mind that the was based on comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all but none of this movies saving graces can it make it something would recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission this movie is definitely not for young children should not really be problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing if you really want catch movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be trust me spawn has very little offer even the most avid moviegoers,0.0

it is time take cover after hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back renewed zest in early there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters dantes peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar of the two had heard that dantes peak was the better so decided check it out when it was released on video the begins slow motion scene of people in third world country trying evacuate their little town the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is volcanic eruption flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people we see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing it is disaster of biblical proportions signified us one person dragging cross down road symbolism does not get much more blatant than that we learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan volcanologist the s geological survey was there his wife when the eruption occurred harry survived but his wife did not few years later harry is sent investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dantes peak washington we are told has been voted second most desirable place live under the readers of money magazine there harry meets rachel wando single mother of two who serves as mayor of dantes peak and proprietor of small coffee shop although the mayor does not seem be alarmed the presence of man sent determine if the mountain next their town is going blow up few members of the city council are they are afraid that harrys presence is going scare off an investor who has pledged put millions of dollars into developing dantes peak they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug however when an amorous young couple takes skinnydip in the local hot springs they turn up cooked lava bubbles up from small fissure underneath thus begins chain of events leading up the inevitable eruption this contains number of cliches the amorous couple is one as soon as they doff their clothes you know they are going die the town busybody and the abrasive motherinlaw make appearances as does the deathdefying dog countless familiar scenarios only serve make this very predictable watching the movie was able not only anticipate each of the major plot elements but some of the dialogue as well unfortunate since much of the dialog is terrible for example harrys boss paul charles hallahan and team from the s geological survey join harry assess the situation paul basically tells the townsfolk that harrys eruption predictions are not cause for alarm this causes harry leave in fit of rage only turn up the next day ready for work when paul asks harry why he stayed he says grim determination cause this towns in trouble and am the best man you have got even better is when harry is trying explain the need jolt the residents into leaving he likens the situation how frog will jump out if dropped into pot of boiling water if the frog is in cold water is gradually heated up however the frog will not move and will allow itself be cooked is that your recipe for frog soup asks one of the team members it is my recipe for disaster responds harry dantes peak has singular talent for pointing out the obvious our heroes are in boat in the middle of lake harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned acid mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction proclaiming in very grave tone acid eats metal thanks for the tip when we first see the s geological survey building there is caption labeling it as such this would not have been so bad if it were not for the fact that the caption is right above sign on the building reads in large letters s geological survey suppose the caption is for people who cannot read signs although harry and mayor wando become an item the end of the the viewer has no idea why there is severe lack of chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because of this when they get close kissing was asking myself why do they want kiss were they even attracted each other if were the mayor would sure think twice about kissing guy who does not even crack smile through the whole movie trying pull off the roughyetdebonair act who does he think he is james bond the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed there are several warning signs prior the eruption itself but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we do not feel as if they are leading up anything for example one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order retrieve remote controlled robot tremor occurs does he plunge headlong his death is he engulfed in lava shoots up from below no couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg the sole purpose of this scene seemed be set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene suppose was intended be dramatic as well it was not one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dantes peak in disaster movie there is usually one guy who is greedy enough cover up the possibility of eruptionfireearthquakeexplosiontsunamitornadometeorite and usually gets killed the disaster it is okay of course because we all think he got what he deserved if you are going be unoriginal you might as well go all the way in dantes peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they do not really try hard enough maybe the mayors abrasive motherinlaw should have been the one for no apparent reason she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate there are couple of good things about this movie the first is the scenery there are panoramic shots of forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful the second is the special effects they are the closest have ever seen real pyroclastic eruption but when elements do not speak are going be the best parts of your movie you would probably better rewrite the script,0.0
capsule hamhanded and overunderwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment so muddled it does not even know what it is really advocating if anything time kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations and it is easy see why it presents strong almost rancorously so story it is full of good actors samuel jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton and it is ostensibly about some important social issue that we are all tangling it is not however good movie and all of the reasons have listed above have something do why right from the beginning the movie is deadset on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible pair of redneck whites boozed and drugged out of their minds kidnap young black girl abuse and rape her horribly and leave her for dead after their arrest their father jackson takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way trial mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics the acting is not quite what it should be given the cast we have sandra bullock who is good actress but not serious one looks clueless spaceys accent switches itself on and off at random and he is given totally thankless role play as well role without an iota of depth and mcconaugheys role is stamped from the cardboard back of cereal box the most memorable role is donald sutherlands and his is bit part always consider it an index of movies desperation when it is able present shocking and outlandish events and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact there is one scene riot outside the courtroom that should have created incredible tension but winds up playing out like textbook exercise on how not deploy scene like this because the movie does not know what it is really about it cannot generate any genuine tension and so it has artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting one of the ways it does this is throwing in whole subplot about bunch of vicious kkk crossburners is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic was reminded of the despicable betrayed tried tart up fundamentally empty story injecting vile graphic acts of racism as little more than an attentiongetter the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential making few critical mistakes first of all the jackson character is not hard judge there is no tension in his dilemma he is selfadmittedly guilty and should be sent jail no matter how moral his crusade the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him if he was white is supposed be the underlying theme of the movie but it is never developed into an organic component of the story it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously its plot mechanics another mistake is in motivational logic not having the two white thugs arraigned first or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence say we have that much less empathy for jacksons character am probably supposed think that just because he had his daughter raped we are automatically supposed feel empathy for him but that is precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible see the virgin spring for more on that note is jacksons character then simply insane that prospect is not given terribly serious treatment either one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem know about how the law works or how lawyers get their information mcconaugheys character makes an important slipup late in the movie when one of his witnesses turns out have been convicted of capital offense how did the prosecution get this information how come he did not get it the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movies way of dealing complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slambang fashion this is the biggest problem the movie is not about jacksons character or his dilemma or this case or any of its frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction characters it is not ultimately about anything at all except its stupid geareddown plot inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards totally contrived ending at two and half hours the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten there is endless stuff about things ultimately add up nothing and no writing about the material that should really matter it is all handwaving the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair it is not easy make movie about something the other day saw kurosawas phenomenal rashomon movie that is really about the way people deal truth and reality or do not time kill is as empty and ponderous movie as have seen in long time,0.0
deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean squidlike menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last springs anaconda deep rising has no tongue put in its cheek folks we are only month into the new year and already heres candidate for one of its stinkiest releases most of the action takes place on the argonautica luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uhoh if these people had seen titanic then maybe they would have known stay home when it is attacked giant tentacled sea creature the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and few other crew members mercenary team lead resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby but what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked hungry and not very helpful the main problem deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt differentiate itself from most scifihorror films in recent memory the concept is leviathan meets titanic dash of speed thrown in for good or is that bad measure this monster is equal parts leagues under the sea and the relic knows how open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets expel halfdigested victim neat effect admittedly la the giant snake in anaconda some of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien scene where the remaining survivors have travel under water escape death is right out of alien resurrection there is even jet ski chase like hard rain and the list goes on watching deep rising cast battle the beast is murky chore in itself because none of them have welldeveloped characters nor do they seem project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy williams is affable enough but his finnegan just is not believable an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye killer thighs is trapped in forced romantic interest williams while kevin oconnor as finnegans mechanic provides comic relief screechy manic shtick that gets old fast djimon honsou who received raves for his performance as noble slave in decembers amistad pops up in brief part he needs stay away from the water the movies final shot is groaner as is the thhour regurgitation of subplot involving an onship saboteur as if cast deserving of their snack foodfate is not bad enough when you taunt the monster you are really asking for it deep rising is slow stupid slog through story without single bright spot and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid swallow the whole ship is not out of the question,0.0
mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeals only the sm crowd actually think mandingo is strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts it is too trashy be good drama but too dramatic be good trash the story takes place on dilapidated louisiana plantation run crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day in new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains it mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley according the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has fight off others in order get him hammond then spends his time training mede be fighter in money brawls other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants escape her family and he is under pressure from his father produce grandchild hammond however is happier spending nights his bed wench the derogatory name given female slaves used their masters for easy sex it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did of course it is fine that he is slept numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife white lady had been another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity care for her so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping ellen blanche gets back at hammond seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth halfblack child although it is okay that ellen was pregnant hammond so warren kills the child letting it bleed death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into giant cauldron of boiling water yes you read right the ends hammond getting his revenge boiling mede alive judging only the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation the main purpose of the seems be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society when mandingo was released in it was still bit of shocker see miscegenation on screen in such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it is mostly confused if one were judge history this it would be easy walk away the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics not once in the do we see any of the slaves working except for few house servants the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of female slave seems be free sex for the owner there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept their female slaves but mandingos overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of cheap sex flick although there is plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure some tried write off mandingo as blaxploitation one of number of quicklymade lowbudget films appealing black sensibilities in the early seventies but it is not that easy mandingo was studiofinanced paramount pictures and produced dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible the remake of king kong and the illfated dune the director was richard fleischer veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including leagues under the sea and fantastic voyage as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin the script based on the supermarket bestseller ken ostott and the subsequent play jack kirkland was penned norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico james mason perry king and susan george were wellknown and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared have promising career so why is mandingo so bad number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did lousy job wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slavetalk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whutre you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed black brother fleischers direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first movies take an alternative look at slavery until then there had been kind of underlying racism in all films dealing slavery even classics such as gone the wind can be seen as inherently racist its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it was not all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this is constantly undermined the films negligible pointofview it claims see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals them the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexlers script refuses move them beyond surface level of trashily vicarious viewing there is great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindlers list looking at nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for jewish maid the difference between that and mandingo is that spielberg dealt the situation in fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished,0.0
the above is dialogue from this taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up bit make it more inept than it is it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the and basically serves as perfect example of what this is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant be taken seriously mr gregg amhavingamidlifecrisis araki the writer and director of this wants show how important teenagers are and wants show how they feel in such horrible horrible world and how does he show it really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this oh and it gets better similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this am not counting the several masturbation scenes in it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about sorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus of course what do you expect the was written and directed guy who cannot even spell his first name right yes know it is cheap joke but it had be done the doom generation is advertised as road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst one of the slogans is teen is fourletter word hardy har har it is about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon white james duval who would go on play randy quaids son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would go on play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do and the way do you get the symbolism red white and blue huh huh and go on road trip where three things happen in no order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them the is basically remix of bunch of other far superior films gregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries borrow elements from all these films and make something is like pop culture reference guide but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them make them deeper the doom generation does not want do this it just wants show everything in surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want deal them on any kind of real level he wants show everything in weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed be about heres one scene an earlier scene in the amy and jordan go into quicke mart type place get food and other stuff amy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you love how racist this is really do tells her put it out she tells him fuck off or something that note he points shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them the counter the cash register rings up oh and this symbolism does not stop here jordan checks for his wallet but it is really in the car he asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money they say they do not have it he gets ready kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere scene before pops out of nowhere fights the clerk and ends him blowing the clerks head clean off clean wound mind you the head is shown flying through the air and lands in fryer where it begins scream do not really object this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the for one reason and one reason only gross you out araki thinks that if he takes everything the extreme he will make some kind of art wrong it takes kind of resistance make gore art when george romero made dawn of the dead very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able make everything sick same goes for peter jacksons disgustingly gory dead alive features minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending guy lawn mower strapped his body taking out all sorts of zombies it was sick but it was also satirical and controled scene like this has no purpose in the and it sticks out from everything else that happens heres couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch giant sword put there just so this could happen fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off xavier and various other annoyances also look for about million camoes from wide assortment of people who probably did not really know what they were getting into when they signed up do it just like peter otoole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably did not when they signed be in caligula people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return the annoying main plot line why are they here so that we can all point them and say hey look it is fill in the blank wow gimme break the films meaning is pretty easy detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such horrible place that when the two entities collide there is giant explosion of horrific violence otherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being teenager is horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you look am years old went through very brief teen angst thing curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did have since moved on do not really know what do my life phase but the teen angst phase is something is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any that thinks they are dealing it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse part of being teen is experimenting and testing the waters it is not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent this is what the characters in this do and the wants show how they are these great people who are being punished the world because they are teenagers and how they try defend themselves but cannot totally overcome them it is not their fault they kill people it is the worlds what they really need is reality check the world is bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting but part of it is taking everything that happens you and learning from it the thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there is nothing they can do about it hence the title not only does it have bad fallacy but it cannot even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner everythings overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst how does talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way and why does the constantly go back the teen angst issue of the if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction he would show them for what they really are and if he did not want the satirical approach he would show the real problems the world and if you still do not think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting rose macgowan is horrible yes she proved herself talented in scream but she is so bad in the doom generation that if had not seen her in scream would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today her entire performance is onenote bitchy and the one scene where she cries over dead animal is so forced that it is laughable equally bad is jonathan schaech who wants be the slacker serial killer someone who does not have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain his performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do and then there is james duval let us just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando he has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that have now deemed him least talented actor in the world have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got be the worst or at least somewhere up there heres another example of bad scene if you are still not convinced the opens up in club where they are playing nine inch nails most banal song heresy example of the lines god is deadand no one caresif there is helli will see you there and as the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the pans over amy just standing there looking dispondent the closes in on her she looks right at the

ladybugs is typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield this picture does not play like comedy for children so who is it aimed at and why is it told like minute sitcom instead of feature rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee total schmuck working at huge corporation he obviously does not have lot of self esteem and thinks he has kiss up get ahead he does volunteering coach the companys girls soccer team what shock learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem know even less did not laugh but for some reason it did not annoy me that much chesters fiancee bess graff thinks he got promotion in addition the coaching position and of course she has slacker for son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams jonathon brandis is nice surprise as matthew who agrees dress up as girl named martha help out chester probably because the girl he has crush on plays on the team what original story ideas what we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed some cross dressing unfortunately the is not smart enough play upon the drag aspect in fact it downplays it so heavily it is totally unbelievable could it be any more obvious martha is boy he only wears girls wig without any makeup and they do not even give him falsies brandis does not bother mimic girls voice either then there is pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for dress but for what reason martha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy dress for her just when we think the martha character is going be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for new plot pick up on when bess discovers what is really going on she breaks up chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss this could have been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that there is just too much of sitcom feel here especially during the socalled serious moments and all the confusion between the characters have seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it does not seem as bad as it is dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what price,0.0
the happy bastards quick movie review the concept of enjoying stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control sadly that is the case kingpin directed the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there is something about mary and dumb and dumber since the duo directed and did not write the script can assume that is part of the problem the story seems good enough pro bowler in the the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world his popularity has gone through the roof and he is getting his career off the ground then however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray rival bowler hardly any real consideration for well anything these two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming eds abandoned him and he is about lose his hand in bowling ball machine forward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete mechanical hand tornup car and of course the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord avoid paying rent for while however he finds glimmer of hope upon visit local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm the kids help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada of course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well he is amish this leads some of the best comic scenes in the such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow finally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper beautiful hustler played the gorgeous vanessa angel the main problem had kingpin was not the fact it was not funny in fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children something involving cheese grater but that is just it scenes there is couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend mean was this really necessary could not have this been handled just bit wackier mean this is comedy why throw ethics in particularly in farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken that really ruined it however and that is too bad the acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting still if you are going think dumb think dumb all the way through ok at least the farrelly brothers got back on track mary or would still be little bit irked,0.0

robin williams this time without beard returns drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects he plays chris nielsen who meets annie annabella sciora and promptly marries her they have two great kids who sadly die in car crash just when it could not get any worse chris gets killed in car crash and goes heaven where he meets his guide albert gooding jnr annie cannot take the grief anymore and kills herself all sounding like good fun so far the penalty for suicide is go hell and chris goes on mission try and rescue her using the help of the traveller max von sydow based on novel twilight zone writer richard matheson what dreams may come is clunky manufactured material doused extra load of sugar this is the worse spielberg spielberg never made everything is wrong about this movie the performances are forced and the audiences fail relate any of the characters williams puts on convincing upset face but that is all it is face there is no emotion behind it scioras performance is lazy and bogs down the whole she may look pretty but she cannot act max von sydow is k as the traveller if nothing special cuba gooding jnr thankfully adds some bounce his performance and is certainly the best performer in the it is shame that his character is so flat and and offers no room for improvement all the performers have work soppy script that tries it is best get some emotion going but never takes off the ground there are _some_ scenes could be real heartwarmers but the faceless characters do not help get anything out of the performers while films like t used great actors music and direction pull of masterful hearttugging scene what dreams may come is haphazard expecting the emotion come out of the scene automatically instead it is all rather boring sure the music is pretty michael kamen and the cinematography is not bad eduardo serra but there is something lacking the script does not help filled hopeless romantic clich and dud speeches richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories sadly this novel would look embarrassed in bargain bin let alone being converted into million vehicle for robin williams despite being set in heaven what dreams may come is mightily depressing the rushes happy ending but everything before this is very very sad and black just adds make the ending even more hopeless and stupid but there is one redeeming feature about this failure of movie the special effects heaven and hell are truly incredible places and the actors fit perfectly the virtual sets but despite this what dreams may come proves be nothing but the biggest disappointment of instead of raising questions about existence it raises boredom sadly recommend you give this miss better luck next time robin david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes,0.0
the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken fred randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes it was not me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others well when it comes this movie being as horrible as it is williams cannot take all the blame but he sure cannot justify himself his own simple tag line either fred has dreamed of space travel since he was young boy turning the clothes dryer into mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at poster of the earth as yearold fred has not grown up much but at least he is somewhat closer his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa when an astronaut for an upcoming mission mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out fill the void fred yes although he is an obviously klutzy moron nasa does not think twice about throwing him into rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known for the first part of the we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play his passive approach the program eventually leads many recordbreaking feats much the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others the red planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist from here on out we are subjected one lame gag after another dealing snot laxatives and flatulence you know standard kid movie material almost sounding like poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it while he is not as annoying as other actors who cater zany stupid comedy he is just as unlikeable say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny why because while he possesses the stupidness needed pull off such role his performance is too understated and boring classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious their own idiocy stan laurel for example was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him peter sellers as inspector clouseau was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at it is best williams on the other hand cannot garner the pity he needs make us love him in all his antiglory as for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever this is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema massproduced less than mediocre over priced and hard stomach giving it oneandahalf stars is extremely generous but even will admit laughing few times the amazing thing is that even in theater packed little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they did not crack up over every little thing then again maybe they were asleep some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults are not the targeted audience and therefore are not meant and will not enjoy them sadly it is also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it is presented right twohour still shot of dog cartoonish voice over could entertain lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast could easily do the same thing and saying that parents perspective is not important is quite poor theory have when they are the ones who take the kids these films in the first place,0.0

retrospective city of the living dead review mike watson copyright mike watson once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dimwitted and golly just about all other words fail me when confronted dog like city of the living dead although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them two points in the movies favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but and large city of the living dead is failure and like most cinematic failures it comes down bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction the story starts in new york when during seance medium katherine mccoll sees vision of priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts for reasons we will not go into here this opens the gates of hell must be closed all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued crusty old journalist christopher george that scene in itself is howler why would you bust open coffin large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside and do not cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they are buried anyway off the two of them go dunwich save the world where various grisly goingson are already happening as all saints day approaches fulcis graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves further highlight the films flimsy script and plodding direction the dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable not bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach mccoll does not have clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard watch and the geezer the actors name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder stomach than mccoll as the progresses christopher georges performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end zombie and we do not care in fact we do not care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that has not mattered so much when he was on form as stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond as director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here he constantly uses extreme closeups of peoples eyes ridiculous technique suggests an attempt convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors are not capable of and despite some gruesome violence he barely manages single scare in the entire longtime collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electropop that is quite frankly embarrassing fulcis other films of this period may be flawed house the cemetery the beyond the black cat but they are nonetheless films more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey for completists only,0.0

years ago robin williams made _jumanji_ brilliant achievement in special effects but travesty on nearly every other level the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ boring illogical weepiewannabe that left my senses numb do not get me wrong love breathtaking special effects and pulsepounding imagery _brazil_ is on my personal top ten _the city of lost children_ is great because of its outlandish scenarios even love __ and _last year at marienbad_ being in the minority amidst my friends _what dreams may come_ imagery aside has little daring thought complement its imagery the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized it is idea of plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular _minds eye_ videos robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurelynot only in the story but before we have chance really know and care for him the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience the afterlife big mistake it would have been far better take the halfhour or so needed tell his life story first ala _it is wonderful life_ so that can build up respect for him so could know and possibly care for him his children and his longsuffering wife played superbly annabella sciorra instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence rushing into the story expecting that the grow in depth as it progresses it does not so in the afterlife chris learns that people still do not meet god that our thoughts are reality and time does not exist there hmm ill grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way it and give it due respect that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense read on chris wife commits suicide since suicides go hell chris would be separated from his wife forever the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love good question and like good thoughtprovoking questions dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the becomes popular rescue especially rescue does not take its underlying premise seriously _really_ loathe it when its story is no longer run logic but special effects hey chris did you forget your thoughts are _real_ they are more _real_ than the physical world according the newage screenplay so why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity because there would be no movie thats why and albert the angel played miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly thats fantasy umm if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able tell you that and if you happen think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts are not big enough sustain you for eternity well in all due respect that is why do not subscribe this theology all due respect another idea based on time pause does not exist here so chris spend your eternity annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out her when she was growing up youve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not freak her out and forcing her write still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky there are many other ideas all of are hundred times better than whats unraveled in the plot the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were him all along and when this happens the runs in slow motion as if build emotion _gag me spoon_ so the only things for me like are sciorras effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects please note that while enjoyed some of the visuals did not enjoy _all_ of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings it sounds like joke but its really true really tried block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack my vote goes rare cd called never say die from petra christian rock group its pretty good and they have song about annie who commits suicide its too late for annieshes gone away for goodtheres so much we would have told herand now we wish we couldbut its too late melancholic yes depressing yes but far more entertaining so in case you dont know let me be straight suicidebad

at first was intrigued the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before saw the now my view has completely changed it is time embrace for impact because this is very bumpy ride the story begins the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at convention they meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead sarris robin sachs of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves thus begins the long adventure help save the thermians the movie plays like really bad star trek episode in fact it is worse do not even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly it is just not funny all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series one such continuous joke involves simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series creative jokes like this may seem like clever idea but not when they are used death person can only take so much we do not need be tortured especially when you have pay for it it is pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful it is not like expected an oscar worthy performance form him but few laughs would have been helpful speaking of acting fine talents were wasted as well sigourney weaver was here show cleavage well at least it worked it is pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the is cleavage it just shows you how disgraceful the really is alan rickman however was not so lucky after his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself doing this sloppy mess it is just shame see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away when the could not get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up like many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting name few they rely heavily on effects help boost the films box office results times it works but unfortunately we have shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk when will it stop am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash it may look fine and dandy but we need at least have story is that too much ask obviously it is when galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic it is an embarrassment the cast and it is embarrassing the science fiction genre it is not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining the only place where this movie belongs is infinity and beyond,0.0
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation batman and robin both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations in panelsized morsels implausible plots and rambo esque dialogue are often overshadowed the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens it is much more difficult dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons white who is framed corporate baddie played without irony sheen then set on fire and left for dead though the movie skimps on the next few plot points heres what could determine said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army under the tutelage of flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating as always he is renamed for reasons unbeknownst spawn and granted really cool costume that enables him become something of human chameleon but when spawn spies on birthday party for his child he realizes that he cannot be the evil superdemon he is expected be and he sets about avenging his untimely death typical of summer blockbusters spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video while the visions of hell are laughably crude think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something behold but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion spawn longs for his wife but they do not have single scene together before simmons death conflict who will triumph is not anybodys guess and believability not that expected it so many questions are left unanswered and am sure they will not be addressed in the inevitable sequel while last years the crow city of angels suffered similar problems its narrative was lazy and somewhat incoherent it had atmosphere spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power spawn is an inyourface screaming banshee of these guys know how graft comic book onto celluloid but they have not the faintest idea how make movie,0.0

here is movie that sadly follows the hong kongrecipe of moviemaking and storytelling the letter these kinds of movies are marked an eyeopening sequence that introduces us the main characters lifeanddeath plot in these characters become involved the inclusion of host of inconsequential characters ridiculous subplots and sunglasswearing henchmen that is not say that do not like hong kong influenced movies however it is quite obvious that these moviemakers have not clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hiphoptalking thugs and stupid sight gags observe the opening sequence band of hitmen are about storm an apartment led melvin mark wahlberg and cisco lou diamond phillips they are waiting for their partner cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment the help of infrared goggles however their partner is unsure of cable cut he is undecided this happens for about seconds the audience finds some humor in his foolishness the lights suddenly go out cisco is surprised and says whoa let us go and they storm the apartment in very nicely executed sequence the big hit of the title refers kidnapping that happens quarter of the way through the needing cash cisco devises plan kidnap the daughter china chow of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi however the daughter is also the goddaughter of paris avery brooks who is ciscos and melvins boss infuriated and insufferable paris commands cisco uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping during his investigation cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader and paris orders his capture and execution melvin must now find way stay alive the way do you know how the investigation takes place ciscos partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of trace buster that prevents tracing but mr nishi has trace buster buster counter that ciscos partner has trace buster buster buster but nishi has trace buster buster buster buster and so on there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in they live and there are lots of issues that we would like know more about how does melvin justify his profession his fiancee what goes on among this clique why is cisco at odds melvin there is actually lot of potential material that could have been explored but it seems that no effort is made go in that direction and instead we are given notsoengrossing plot filled oneliners silly sight gags extraneous subplots and tomfoolery and have not even mentioned his financees visiting parents who want them separate nor melvins mistress nor the pimplefaced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences then shoot me now,0.0
after the huge success of the exorcist in sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided make ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely needless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time agree start the story it is four years later and regan is being tormented memories of what used be now priest played richard burton is trying figure out why this demon tried possess regan and now the demon somehow wants possess her again maybe she was good or something now they must try stop this demon from taking over regans body before it is too late some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is linda blair she had no need revive her character and she is really terrible in this she brings it down lull and in places it seems like it just stops in its place and does not go anywhere louise fletcher is alright for what it is worth but she could have done lot better than this the direction john boorman is that of confused stylish nature that really could not figure out in fact had no idea what was going on in this the script was jumbled the plot was jumbled and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad for those exorcist fans who have not seen this one recommend renting it actually gave this one high rating if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins went easy on it however because of the fact that it has bit of good direction but nothing else im not saying like the now so dont start going anywhere bad bad bad movie,0.0

i have always been kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances the minute saw the trailer for this resolved see it besides the fact that kline starred it looked like hilarious got sucker punched the trailer an extent however as also thought wow if there is this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be ton of laughs in the rest of the oops packed up the wife and headed les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multimultiplex the began the concerns an englishdrama teacher at suburban high school named howard brackett he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played matt dillon would put in his name but my wife will not let me take notes during movie and have forgotten it they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions fawning questions about him brackett has been engaged another teacher played joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption marry her the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is homosexual kline spends most of the first twothirds of the frantically trying convince everyone that he is not the whole town begins examine every detail of his life and begins identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference his closest friends do not help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs his stag party there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity kline is hounded gay reporter played tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations the movie moves along fine and slowly builds the climax of the wedding kline stands at the altar and is asked take his vows if you want be surprised do not read am going reveal the ending instead of saying do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says am gay this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart most of the humor in the had come from klines insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live it was funny it was sustainably funny and klines performance made it doubly so however after the wedding the drags on they should have attempted come quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he is done he reconciles his parents and his friends some of had turned on him there are several scenes seemed like waste of time the scene his mother and her friends was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene tom selleck in the bar joan seemed pointless finally even though am not catholic found the scene the priest be condescending the preist cannot believe that man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming brackett in the third person he is gay it got chuckle from the audience but was distracted it and began tire of the the time the wedding had come and gone found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying overall if have quantify it say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets see it in economy time,0.0

i know there were times during this movie that laughed pretty hard the problem is cannot remember them as write this review that is not good sign in booty call jamie foxx is bunz character whom cannot really describe because do not know that much about him only know that he likes shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he does not like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment bunz has best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems be bunzs direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in longterm commitment whole seven weeks wow rushon wants finally sleep his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for reason is not totally explained it is going happen after double date bunz and nikkis friend lysterine vivica fox who have never met make long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts do the deed spoiled nikkis obsession safe sex first she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them oh no they have be latex not lambskin back the store now they have got get dental dams or therell be no foreplay why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes demand nikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her she would better be making these demands too talk about coitus interruptus booty call is that does not know whether it wants be regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies the difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen are so far removed from reality in this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane at the extreme there are times during booty call where the steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats the safety of convention it is disappointing and even worse distracting there are also instances where the screenplay takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names does not live up its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined bad writing for instance there is scene where our main characters are in chinese restaurant bunz goes up an asian gangster and speaks him in fluent cantonese much everyones surprise however when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films and soon gained mastery this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene if on the other hand when asked how he learned speak chinese bunz simply replied kungfu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective this is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable explaining the point and trying make the ridiculous plausible the is not giving its viewers enough credit the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine if nikki is so obsessed safe sex why does not she have some condoms at her own apartment these questions are not answered the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language some movies use lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent characters pattern of speech other films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves booty call just sticks them in get laughs and it does not work they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason use them half of the scenes seem occur for no reason the chinese restaurant holdup at convenience store and trip the hospital seem have nothing do the story and are in there for filler this is surprising considering that the is less than eighty minutes long it is too bad that the core of the is not much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog refer you the first paragraph of this review,0.0
retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been popular trend this year earlier this may leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the toprated miniseries that debuted on cbs and now director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent god rescue france from the clutches of their enemies starring milla jovovich who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being witch the messenger the story of joan of arc is disjointed and overblown historical reenactment that prevails merely as bloated mistreatment of the famous legend besson who is previous work includes the hyperactive scifi the fifth element perhaps entrusted bit too much faith in exwife jovovich because in the messenger the actress is drowning in pool of her own inexperience at first when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such demanding role was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry of such caliber after seeing the rousing trailer my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed milla jovovich looked superb the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance the messenger looked like timeless epic in the making timeless epic it is not besson is hesitant abandon his unique and flashy style and the story behind the messenger is not entirely suited his demands on the shoulders of bessons choppy and unexciting direction the dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery there is no human exploration into the character of joan or jeanne jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective jovivichs unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead the realization that besson sees jeanne as piece of spiritual cardboard she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast jovovich does have few isolated moments of sheer power but mainly she looks lost quite frankly do not know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through the messenger without major fumble the script is chockfull of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii john malkovich and informs him of her heavenly intentions faye dunaway plays charles overbearing motherinlaw and dustin hoffman appears over twohours into the story as character dubbed the conscience all three actors juggle limited screen time although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful the battle scenes are extremely bloody but the presence of such jittery camera work they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like braveheart there is particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on when jeanne as young girl watches in horror from closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped bloodthirsty english soldier even his fellow troopers are petrified the messenger is also strictly s update on the classic story almost too it seems there is gratuitous use of the fword and barrage of slang terms like she is nuts sprinkled throughout the screenplay was halfexpecting jeanne invite her homeys come chill in her crib but it never happened there is also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor but none of it comes even remotely close functioning properly it seems terribly misplaced but in catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as the messenger almost everything does the musical score erric serra is spectacular and the set and production designs are continuously impressive if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for then he achieves his goal but the only time the dramatics come alive in the messenger is during the closing trial in jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake during these moments the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience albeit in faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning it is just too delayed for besson revive his lifeless interpretation in he is always concerned the wrong aspects the messenger the story of joan of arc is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition the shelf anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going be painfully slapped an overblown and confusing despite my original hopefulness milla jovovich is not going have worry about thanking the academy,0.0
violence is bad violence is ugly violence breeds yet more violence kids do not try this at home this weighty message is not the only barrier enjoying brother but it is certainly one of the largest written directed and starring the infamous takeshi kitano kikujiro sonatine brother is his first made outside his familial japan bringing the yakuza tradition los angeles yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia if you piss family member off or dishonor yourself in any way the usual punishment is public display of selfmutilation usually resulting in the loss of limbs definition of dishonor can be anything from making stupid decision leaving one family for another it would be interesting know more about where these and other customs come from unfortunately the does not give too much of an explanation assuming its audience is aware of kitanos earlier work there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members leading one assume they would be symbolic of something but you never know what then there is scene in man kills himself in front of rival in exchange for that rival joining the family granted this is one of the best scenes in the movie but it does not make lot of sense instead the two hours are basically spent watching the following people go out and shoot each other talk about it for tenplus minutes then go out and do it again the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose all of the sudden yamamoto kitano has girlfriend he barely speaks her treats her like crap and then sends her away another missed opportunity considering it is such big deal for kitano bring his magic the united states is the combination of cultures rely too heavily on overused stereotypes though slow moving brother does have good elements the action scenes are well directed clearly defined and interesting watch some of the violence is more hinted at than shown produces the luscious squirm that one goes see such films for the actors would be more enticing if they had more do shirases masaya kato loud sarcastic coolness set against yamamotos quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show also its credit brother tackles the cause and effect of crime realism life of crime is easy get sucked into the first reward of quick cash sure people get rich but they can also lose just as easily it is great moral great cast just not much substance back it up,0.0
there nothing quite like gory anime really and this is the truth no other genre in gets away such violence without word being said in the media about it anime common shot is watching body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword this is standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that ve seen vampire hunter is gory gory if they ever made live version of the it would be banned in several countries and given rating somewhere below xxx it not that it gore is unique it just like other gory animes but this one was supposed stand out because of the complexity it story characters animation etc it really didn it was disgusting and gruesome overshadowed the story what little of it there was it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can seem get handle on vampires in the movies one evening blond peasant girl drawn look and innocent foreshadow that we will see her naked guessed early on it would be in the shower or in rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here of course he never put no trespassing sign on his yard so one can really blame her but he upset anyway and demands retribution she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren there other places get blood from it seems like bite in the elbow would do well enough if it is good enough for doctors draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight fight the spell she enlists the help of mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted the year old peasant girl and finding reasons not talk too much you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he a brooder who sole purpose in life is remain really really silent when he speaks it in cliches heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated later the vampire hunter storms the castle meet the big bad vampire who wants marry the peasant girl because he bored after years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter rush save her in time will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable in it defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original the talking hand was clever and think the inspiration for skateboardrelated logo and that the best defense can think of understand that vampire hunter is supposed be fave among anime fans but really don see it it an excuse watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse see animated breasts why what is the point of that maybe have understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny m not prude just don think it warranted it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost is there neccesity in seeing year old in the shower of course not it done for shock it tasteless and despicable,0.0

the tagline on random hearts reads in perfect world they never would have met in perfect world never would have seen this movie the biggest flaw is that minutes into this kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production dutch is sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department kay is congresswoman from new hampshire although they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating each other behind their backs dutch and kay are soon widowed when plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair the rest of the is the pointless unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind and getting know each other in the process two sub plots are of little help the already problematic dutch is trying arrest fellow officer task that seems rather ordinary for fare all the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter kays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts shield her year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on pedestal these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points but the seems afraid explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth and consequently suffers random hearts two primary characters seem live in shells although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem never deal anyone other than themselves or each other there is plenty of opportunity dutch having partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships veteran actor and director of this sydney pollack and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not blink too much or you will miss them both other than its weak plot it is hard criticize random hearts however it is also hard compliment it had the taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates be,0.0

i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series if there is will there is way and believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon this is the reason that responded so well gus van sants universally panned update of psycho thought it be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very onpar an original but do have big problem remakes that are blatantly bad you see the point of remake is or at least it should be iron out the originals flaws and bring the work that much closer greatness or even perfection but what if the source material on the remake is based is not any good begin that is the only cinematic question pondered the bland actioner the mod squad have only seen couple episodes of the late tv series on it is based and be honest did not like it all that much it has concept that and still is interesting group of corrupt young adults all in their early are given choice they either go jail for the various crimes that they all have committed or they can become undercover cops helping the police get into places that they normally would not be able access obviously all opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen and policewomen the three main characters here are played claire danes omar epps and giovanni ribisi of the three only danes has real character ribisis dumbass year old is played exclusively for laughs epps slightly more intelligent one is used create various chase scenes when the squads superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death the three of them sure that their beloved master was framed go off and investigate on their own discovering corrupt cops lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations all kinds of good stuff the only times that the mod squad comes even close working is in its comedic moments although ribisi is trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie his man here is really rather amusing when the script gives him chance epps straight man is effectively played against ribisis clueless spontaneity but the rest of the is dull boring and singularly uninteresting drugop action plot is no longer anything new not even teenage action heroes and the way it is executed here it is also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful claire danes character has potential but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained she could have been tourdeforce but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her do anything really significant her role epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected although their characters are not nearly as rich as danes could have been the mod squad is mindnumbing marketing plot of and teens will jump all over it it is full of bad dialogue scenes and concepts that make no sense and get this drug dealers that like tango other guys in their spare time nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for claire danes is no longer alluring mainly because she is got horrible hairdo so that draw is out there are however cool explosions guns and chases may lure viewer into thinking that he or she is about experience an exciting thriller of some sort do not be fooled some may call this escapist fare call it escapeasquicklyasyoucan fare,0.0

it is almost amusing watch year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup the tango lesson the man who cried the geny actress her cold stare and big black eyes has appeared in an impressive range of films but she does not even come close being the bold heroine the set against the historical backdrop of world war requires her be ricci whose character is shockingly silent and blank showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern shares most of her scenes the astounding cate blanchett quite an amusing sight behold blanchetts lola paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie is bold interesting and layered everything our heroine lacks costar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy blanchett has good seven inches on ricci sports twice the makeup and dons flashy wardrobe the actress inhabits the role as she always so remarkably does fervor and life that makes you want her hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the these landmarks serve as the films little conflict obviously the tables are turned in the life of suzie these events whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues the man who cried has many aspirations none of come full circle the films close there are forced messages here and there go forward always go forward lola preaches suzie there is romance between suzie and fellow target of hitlers nazis the gypsy cesar johnny depp who like ricci barely gets speak lola struggles her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire travel america where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago the films main problem is that potter is not skilled enough tell the epicsized story of suzie the time periods instability the conflicting social classes the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life serving as both writer and director potter throws in some of each but hardly an inch of depth is be found in any the time the sighinducing climax hits the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready leave the theater the films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely are we really meant believe any of this could happen contrastingly in its moving final scene the man who cried strikes note that is made effective in its ties the emotional beginning of the although it is apparent that potter cannot grasp what she reaches am puzzled as why she reaches for so much in the first place riccis suzie is meant be the films core from the extended flashback at the films beginning the quickly drawn ending everything seen in the in some way relates her so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried work as an ensemble but not present enough for the be riccis the almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help depict the area quite nicely and then there is the music from minute one minute ninetyseven there is hardly moment when the wavering skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music do not undercut the action the notes stricken both overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money and reputation catch lolas interest and accompany oftentimes the perfect chords are captured undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note unfortunately the same effort is not given towards almost everything else,0.0

there is scene in patch adams in patch is in the center of courtroom surrounded people who are giving him lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on group of stoic doctors when noticed that the audience whom saw this was reacting the same way realized that was going have hard time finding someone who agrees me about the quality of the picture you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now days later the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories hate every element of the beginning tom shadyacs shameless direction and all the way up the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately convey the badness of patch adams is stupefying it is confounding cannot believe can be this bad and yet it is based on real man who probably has good point make in the patch is played the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human in the beginning of the patch commits himself mental institution because he does not want kill himself while there he notices that the doctors do not care about the patients and that the best way get through the patients is treat them like human beings so patch goes on crusade be great doctor who actually talks his patients he goes medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it is good help people he also meets carin fischer monica potters the antimale med student who just wants go through the motions and be successful doctor naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams so patch decides that he is going build free clinic in the middle of nowhere help people any problem they may have and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of on superficial level the is not particularly bad would not say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem be exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potters performance even if she is wasted but the fails fundamentally in execution every scene swells grand emotional music played at maximum volume just get us all cry real hard take for instance the first scene shows patch sitting on bus we do not know patch yet but there is sad music and it is supposed make us really sad that he is sad later on patch makes lot of progress he helps dying patient peter coyote enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad but the problem all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions real drama is characterbased you grow like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it we do not ever grow know the dying patient he is simply vehicle for patchs greatness real drama does not seem forced or present just make the audience cry that is why patch adams is not real drama it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene even scenes that have very little impact on the overall are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score sentimentality like this is indeed bad but it is not as bad as halfbaked simplistic themes you see patch is really great student he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he is cheating but patch does not think that memorizing facts is the way become good doctor why do not we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something do the fact that you need learn something before you go treating patients not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts no effort most of us have study and doctor who really wants help but does not know toe from finger probably will not be too successful in preventing death oh wait almost forgot the point of doctors is not just prevent death but improve the quality of life yes that is true and you can not do that without studying you can not do that without going medical school what patch never seemed understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea study first and talk patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there is the free clinic issue find shockingly frighteningly idealistic free clinic in the middle of the forest where patients can be taken be helped for free how will patients be transported the free clinic will it have an emergency room or is it just for mental patients and who may ask will pay for it the does give some token attempts question patchs motives think another character asks him how he is going pay for it in addition little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly do not explore or challenge patchs ideas any meaningful extent reader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams know nothing about him if his beliefs mirror those of this character then might like have an intelligent discussion him about them but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this are simplistic and phony and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does lot of shouting actually robin williams does lot of

as any reasonable human being would must admit that occasionally am befuddled certain things am befuddled fight club now sometimes our favorite films are panned critics and do not achieve critical success until much later sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them fight club is either garbage or brilliant but at least right now must lean toward the former maybe am subconsciously affected word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this is pure gold but if it is sure don see it edward norton plays jack field examiner for major automobile manufacturer his insomnia coupled his compulsive desires fill his world ikea furniture complete himself make him loser at the game of life but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his th story window he seeks comfort in stranger tyler pitt whom he met on flight home once jack is sucked into tyler world he can get out literally they begin fight club an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than provide those that join sense of belonging as the fight club grows things get out of control and take on cult status beginning one future soldier who proves his worth standing still outside tyler house for three days dare not even begin bring up the last quarter of the since that contains the twist that explains the pointless journey suffice it say was truly disappointed in fincher who previous two films seen and the game put him in very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation this is not imply any means that he is no longer genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces the table but fight club he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision be distorted silly digital experiments and selfreferencing elements such as talking the audience about what they are seeing telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that slightly altered recurring line is good flashback humor now throughout the coarsely woven texture and overextended plot lines fight club is obviously trying make various social comments about the state of the world today advertisements interoffice politics corporations you name it it addressed though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced all of them play an important role how so well can kinda just tell can really put my finger on it say that starbucks and barnes noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news is that bad for the world probably not much room for social commentary there we all know that interoffice politics are just that politics so what was the point of all this the seems desperate make point or number of points but couldn figure out what they were all saw was very bizarre social satire that was woven strange techniques bleak visual design and some fine acting pitt carter norton all of them are good even meatloaf is good when you get the end you will most likely be filled questions many of the filmmakers wanted you ask of yourself not them because each of them would likely give you different answer fight club means what you want it mean think fincher just gives you the stuff think about but it couldn be more bizarre and unappealing sure it had shock value but so did seen and the game and they were significantly stronger films,0.0
staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris odonnell and uma thurman alicia silverstone well start this off would just like say couple things first is miss michael keaton miss tim burton and would much prefer think that these last two batman films are all like dallas dream sequence not even from the first was batman really the star though he was damn close in the first couple anyway in batman forever and now in batman robin he is almost pushed being bit player cannot really say if clooney who regardless was better than kilmer was very good batman or not he is given next nothing do at all he might as well not have been there and it would not have made much difference now joel schumacher has said that he refuses bend the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark fine mean granted batman returns while being an awsome was bit dark sometimes yet his bright neon campy style is just killing anything this series meant me am usually very easy on films loved con air and other films some critics have slammed granted that really was paper thin cliche ridden except for one thing it was fun there is virtually no fun in this at all could not have cared less it will thrill the little ones as theres no violence really none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends everyone laughing schwarzenegger is awful mean really really bad and this is coming from regular fan of his work love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them he talks all often in this movie would have much prefered have seen patric stewart in the roll believe truely like you have care about at least someone in liked alfred but the reason behind it is cheap shot,0.0
even though have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality like everyone else dreyfuss has bills pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorfs tribe let me start out saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but that is about its only asset the best word describe this is asinine the target audience would appear be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes are aimed at someone going through puberty krippendorfs tribe tries be zany offthewall comedy but the makers have forgotten three important rules the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has exist the second is that viewers should be able identify or at least care about character or two finally and most importantly more than of the jokes have work once upon time james krippendorf dreyfuss was respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college he and his wife obtained grant seek out lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea goal they never accomplished shortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorfs wife died and he was left the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own now over year later the college wants see the results of the money they gave krippendorf he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman inform him that he has been scheduled give lecture on his findings when he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates tale about mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb soon much krippendorfs surprise the shelmikedmu are national phenomenon but one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined prove that the tribe is fraud the only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not mention the viewers are dumber than dirt unfortunately it is impossible like or sympathize bunch of putzes like this director todd holland completely fails develop any character into something more substantial than device implement various dubious gags meanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture e how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative the acting in underwhelming dreyfuss has definitely not given his all the role of james krippendorf alongside him jenna elfman the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else this quality while fine for minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of featurelength movie no one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allens daughter in everyone says love you excels know that movies in trouble when it is half the length of titanic but seems much longer most of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set if there is any upside it is that do not see much boxoffice support developing for this lame illmarketed miscue krippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct,0.0

way of the gun is brimming surprises some good most bad one of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance after the actor gained much attention posing and preening through teen swill like know what you did last summer he hinted at bit growth in last years cruel intentions his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow heart presumably appeal his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how he would fallen for his target it was dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the films director could negotiate but he seems be trying and that should not be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really is not required do much but look pretty here phillippe has procured five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory it is tough believe pretty boy like phillippe as hard ass but his performance actually helps the illusion unlike ben afflecks puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that as for the plot well that is one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced us in the parking lot of rave where they stupidly pick fight about twenty people who hatch scheme kidnap surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she is carrying the baby of painter scott wilson very well connected wealthy man the kidnapping devolves into laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed but the antiheroes escape the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit directed christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity unlike phillipe mcquarrie does not seem be growing at all he fills his flick sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies know have seen before and worse it feels like it the lacks even fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey its clich all of are spewed before us in picture that tries so desperately be hip and gritty without bothering notice how common it is it features characters living code they seemed have picked up in sam peckinpah rather than any thing resembling life even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks have cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc did not like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here it is even more self consciously dramatic usual suspects also featured bunch of low lives that seemed live code they learned from the movies worked some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential thus nearly every character in way comes at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but admit did not see it coming and smiled however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects lot of faux huffing and puffing no rhythm or reason or substance it is just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters distinctive style or good script would be even the good stuff most of involves james caan doing fine job feels odd and out of place in movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice out the satisfaction are clever at one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass have seen porno better dialogue and some better plot lines too but rarely has porn offered up such talented cast mean can you even compare james caan ron jeremy caan slips into this role seeming ease he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in coma but he manages give his character depth and weariness benicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting brad pittesque quizzical pout go along his heavy swaggering speaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is weak link either shouting her lines ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like silly goose nicky katt was brilliant in brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted he is only kept around for his cold presence taye diggs has similar function cool as ever but never character though the guy has one helluva death scene for the most part way is incessantly talky no reason give hippos ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns it is vaguely tarantinoish but in bad truth and consequences nm way phillippe in one scene leaping into stupid rant about faggots migrating los angeles you know the routine the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems be doing bargain basement john woo interchangeable bad guys lining up be shot at but those gun shots sure crack like thunder just the other day was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned hear the weak elephant gruntlike sound that emanated from

when critics attack seemingly wellintentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as am about do their opinions are often greeted backlash of angry emails sometimes even mock death threats from those who suppose like be shamelessly manipulated their entertainment even politicians tend dismiss critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on goodhearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction these fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable tend forget that critics job is review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may be thusly patch adams is not bad because it is about doctor who cares for his patients it is bad because it is calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place though even doubt that stay tuned an explanation is forthcoming it is still an unpleasantly maudlin mess the picture is about an emotionally guarded th grade history teacher somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world year old trevor haley joel osmet disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother helen hunt comes up the notion pay it forward this entails person doing one good deed call it an uber favor for three others then telling them do the same for three others and before long we are all living in frank capra movie meanwhile in parallel story weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement has apparently begun grow pay it forward has odd ideas about tone at certain points it hurls smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote the unrelenting sappiness at its core it is as if director mimi leder did not have the confidence make pay it forward the way she intended and compromised out of fear that her was not gutsy enough earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for so the picture adds grit child molester propositions trevor homeless man returns heroin after being saved character is knifed while doing good deed etc though it seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the itself is not quite sure if it is ready buy into its own utopian blather pay it forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohrs umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball angie dickinsons earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jivetalking black hoodlum heart of gold coming on the heals of the black godlike inmate embodied gabriel casseus in bedazzled this may just be the beginnings of brand new guilty white liberal clich hurray for who actually calls the mohr character nigga and says things like can you feel me leave it pay it forward happily include little minstrel act for our further enjoyment maybe spikes flick was not so misguided after all these scenes feel as if they belong in dopey comedy feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you will find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is that could make the world better place me the final product has the oily feel of cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans hopeful audience it is picture that looks be tailor made for academy consideration the main players all previous oscar winners or nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns one scene in slightly deglamed helen hunt deglamed here means that not only is she fashion victim her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama hunts hair is also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip spacey of course responds in his cultured monotone that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can he not even when he is emoting spacey seems somehow shielded wry indifference the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender in one atrocious touched an angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth the guilty hand in that very same stroke and said hand still on said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and am not making this up she scurries the kitchen tearing the place apart in frenzied search for alcohol the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as parody of hackneyed tv movie blowups it is all very theatrical especially hunts performance feels like pathetic plea the academy for another oscar pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being that could be used as an argument for why actors should not get academy awards the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists even haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections his acting has become broader less intimate it is as if we can make out the little munchkins thoughts boy this outta floor em naturally osmet is made play one of those onlyinthemovies children martyrfigure who cleans up after his mother lectures her on the ills of drinking and even fixes her up on date his intellectual teacher never mind that the two could not be more dissimilar his mother is trailer trash dopey and the teacher is one of those dennis millerey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind vast vocabulary nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way bring the pair together in scene that recalls parent trapish cornball antics but oh how we love bright articulate selfsacrificing children who pick adults up their bootstraps and guide them through life they are so adorable of course the blame cannot all be hoisted onto the actors though the exception of the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt of it should be passed on mimi leder who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er then went on make two awful genre films in row the first being the peacemaker witless postcold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one of the two films of squander the premise of earths possible demise crazed meteorite the first flick was sunk an over reliance on clich and complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement not aided an ending actually centered around the diffusing of ticking time bomb complete digital read out apparently present for an invisible audience deep impact has more in common pay it forward it is movie that treats earths impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be goner within days the was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled up make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching in pay it forward leder continues in this vein her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like rebuttal see my movie is not as na ve as you might think she seems be saying no it is just horribly confused,0.0

the s army utilizes number of books known as field manuals stipulate the specific way in almost every action imaginable must be done one particular field manual is known as the fm among other things covers the practice of saluting under the saluting section is subsection covers how salute is rendered military work detail in the presence of superior officer the salute is rendered the highestranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail in any event the salute is rendered only the man or woman in charge rather than the whole group almost at the very beginning of the generals daughter we see generals motorcade passing work detail everyone salutes it looked impressive but it just was not right that little bit showed me that someone either did not do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision go style over substance for the scene in fact this would serve as metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard craft atmosphere and flash that he forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial good movie what results is that looks good but like that one scene just is not right the first fifteen minutes of the is good example paul brenner john travolta is an agent for the armys criminal investigation division undercover at georgia army base investigate an illegal arms sale prior the transaction the buyer gets whiff that brenner is not the unscrupulous supply sergeant he is supposed be and later that night attempts kill him shooting up the houseboat on brenner is living so ensues cat and mouse action sequence ends like certain scene in raiders of the lost ark we will just say that it involves propellers brenner then receives new orders when the commanding generals daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the bases training ranges he is teamed rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder what want know is why the whole action scene the arms buyer was even necessary it gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that he is little cocky does the arms subplot turn up later no so why add this extra running time the the answer it looked cool or how about the atmosphere the beginning of the generals daughter presents us imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up bayouesque music nice immersion in the setting but it soon does not matter for when the films plot shifts over the murder investigation so does the entire mood no attention is paid the location of the story and the music is altered fit very generic thriller theme did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making different movie instead of creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire we get the distraction of one of theme followed another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside the above examples also serve illustrate that inconsistency is another problem this movie as have already mentioned an entire section of the does not jibe the rest and the characterization only adds the difficulty brenner who comes across as man little respect for authority suddenly snaps in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir i have ever heard he even delivers an emotioncharged monologue about why he will work so hard catch the person who killed the generals daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just couple of minutes previous sunhill who initially comes across as professional investigator utilizes couple of blatantly illegal methods obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity both characters are protagonists but it is hard get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actors aside and tell them let us do it again but this time want more say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this they overact in most of their scenes an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the generals aide colonel fowler swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad cannot help but think he was acting from wests direction couple of side characters including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scenes nearly impossible bear the only two actors who seem have escaped wests influence are james woods who provides good performance as colonel moore elisabeths mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police woods relishes the role of man whose job is playing peoples minds and does so without ever taking it over the top hutton just kind of hangs around but at least he was not overacting have not read the nelson demille novel on this movie was based but will bet more than few dollars that the story was better in book form the movie version has got characters come and go little or nothing do except fill up space or provide bits of information seem neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished every time we are presented some new aspect the case west gives us more of that flash playing it up like it is the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used the investigators at all instead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead the army should have saved time bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play game of twenty questions the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was would have been over in half hour the finishes sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning literally during the closing credits we get see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get see sunhill get in her car and drive off they both seem kind of happy maybe they were driving away from simon west,0.0
i do not appreciate it when thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact it is ludicrous in the case of the generals daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you certain point but at this juncture in the story the movie begins fall apart like crumbling cookie this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough compensate for all of it is detailed flaws get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent and you are likely survive this entire movie travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner who is working undercover at military base when another situation arises the apparent rape and murder of young female officer leslie stefanson it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell let the investigation begin the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill played rather onthesidelines madeleine stowe brenner uncovers what appears be an intricate and bizarre homicide case things begin get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore james woods former commanding officer of the deceased who has few secrets up his sleeve woods submits another scenestealing performance here as he oozes authority surrounded clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar echoes of his supporting role in true crime in he duked it out clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges he makes every moment believable here though the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations travolta as the two send mindful knowing glares across the room there are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter in the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult absorb director simon west con air shows watchful eye of delivering stylish looking thriller but he fails miserably when it comes the intellectual part of it the generals daughter is more often than not predictable and unexciting mess it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless dragging it is heels all the way at mindnumbing snails pace few brief action scenes marvelously handled in the editing department show that the movie could have delivered such more proficient package from director who does such great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts suggest west should stick mindless riproaring action features and attempt avoid future projects like this still the movie is certainly not without it is merits the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast the performances range from commanding travolta electric woods stiffasaboard cromwell who does not show off his real talents here madeleine stowe manages hold her own for while but as the female lead in an actionthriller she does not pull through sufficiently one of the problems the execution is that it is very predictable from minute one had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question the script even unwillingly points him out for us using familiar techniques hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end in all fairness we have seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put greater effect in other films the secrets behind the girls mysterious death are explained gradually but the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly the generals daughter is not terrible movie and it is involving enough sustain viewers attention span for certain period of time but it just could have been so much better,0.0
at one point in this movie there is staging of an opera that goes completely wrong but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers thinking the performance was planned and applauding it for their efforts that is dirty work in nutshell very different kind of movie this is not movie that can easily review the critic in me analyzes the structure plot acting characters and tells me this movie is terrible but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than movie it is one note concept mitch and sam need in order bribe doctor give their father heart transplant before other more needy patients realizing they are very good at revenge plots they open revenge for hire business eventually running afoul of rich businessman played christopher macdonald who after roles in happy gilmore and veronicas closet seems typcast in this role who sends them destroy building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriends grandmother thus leading them plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of new opera house first the critic in me the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way heres the catch none of the characters are sympathetic they are all selfish jerks who do not care who they hurt in their attempts do whatever they want the jokes are juvenile crude appealing the worst elements in people there is jokes about prostitutes the homeless beastiality anal sex there is even subplot that is developed it seems only make jokes about infidelity and incest and loved watching it was huge fan of norm macdonalds sarcastic tothepoint comedy on saturday night live and this movie is an hour and half of it norm macdonald takes joke strips it the core and tells it like it is dry wit like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at new construction job the foreman goes over the basics mitch and sam do not understand how do they get out of it admiting they lied on their resumes and do not know thing about construction and surprise they get fired the characters are incredibly meanspirited there is father who is loud and obnoxious gambling addicted doctor played chevy chase who tells sam of his fathers condition saying if were gambling man would put lot of money on death the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky and does who knows what it and then there is mitch and sam who thinking they can get destroying building ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents too bad we have do it mitch says heres movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up where you see every punchline coming where every spot profanity could be used and then is used at least the is honest and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic but at least it is not dull and it is not predictable and that is the way it should be it is sketch comedy and if you are fan of norm macdonald you will love it the jokes are crude the characters are mean the core the attitude of the movie is that it just does not care if you do not like norm macdonald or stupid movies then you probably will not like this one the jokes are crude the characters are mean the core the attitude of the movie is that it just does not care so before seeing this one tune your mindset and prepare for slew of norm macdonald humor gay animal sex prison rape jokes uncaring characters and one last performance from chris farley the critic in me says but give it an just could not stop laughing,0.0

you know never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man while watching instinct could not help but acknowledge the way the carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies even beside the tarzan comparison instinct just is not very good it is painfully idealistic manipulative and silly did not hate it it is simply impossible for me hate any starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good but can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved can also recognize reasons for wanting make instinct and it is pretty clear that this could have been good massive script overhaul and director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams things start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous the subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years powell has been charged the brutal murders of several men in africa and it is now caulders job find out of he is mentally competent enough stand trial through series of short sessions caulder tries put together the complex psyche of powell even though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting as said hopkins is captivating for every second he is on screen he has way of convincing us that he is not acting that he is actually man who has just spent two years of his life living family of wild gorillas the character himself is not very interesting he is just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting subtleties both in speech and action gooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual the screenplay written gerald di pego and suggested novel daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems be the point he has no time for friends because he is obsessed his work nonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct unfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure for they work together make the dumbest most clicheridden environment in their characters are live and they do so means of brainless subplots first we have the prison warden subplot the prison warden is evil and wants stop caulders progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then that is fine there is also the prison guard subplot the prison guard is played john ashton the prison guard seems enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and he is instrumental in helping the story along its obvious conclusion then there is the daughter subplot in maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset lot of the time after all she is the daughter of deranged man if some of this stuff sounds familiar that is because they are all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had ashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison clancy browns in the shawshank redemption hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs and then there is the whole tarzan thing is more than little bit obvious through the entire perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth the message powell brings back from the wild is not subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas can sympathize that but only when it is in compelling this is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them tearing up playing cards what does any of this have do man who has just spent two years of his life gorillas if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had thirtyminute movie far superior the twohour one that watched today if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting movie that does not rely on the strength of its actors,0.0

_in brief _ this needs no introduction if you have not heard of it then you must have been up in space on sabbatical and if you have not seen it well suspect you are in small minority first things first is it all it is hyped up be well yes and no it is good and there is lot like about it but it is not without its problems when saw the first trailer for titanic it was when went see bean last summer think my intial reaction was as not that downright sick make disaster movie out of such dreadful reallife tragedy mean what is happened hollywoods scriptwriters have they run entirely out of new ideas gads whatever next asked myself how about an action based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme was not entirely filled anticipation but then was not alone in that respect it is when it came out in the cinema rave reviews well mostly and anyone whod been see it seemed disturbingly obsessed it that started take notice did not see the until several months after its release time my sister had seen it about four times so went slightly more open mind but still did not think would enjoy it much did yes and no mainly yes am happy say the first hour or so was beautifully done not so much because of the scripting will talk about that later but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning look at as was camerons directing and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the human aspect of the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting the is told via flashback gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day you knew that course well it is an often effective device use in storytelling though sometimes it can fall flat does it work here in script form it does not add all that much the story what does add lot the story is gloria stuart whose stunning performance is the strongest most moving of the her presence brings much deeper level of passion and depth the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the would have suffered without her also impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving it is an old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but it works and jacks rescuing rose in both literal and figurative senses and teaching her live life for what counts was pointed and touching in fact enjoyed the first half of the lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy the romance it is engaging touching and very enjoyable there is more than tinge of poignancy it as well simply because you know it is not going be happy ending leads us the second half of the we all knew it was coming am sure director cameron was looking forward eager anticipation it because as he is stated in interviews the real thrust of the story for him was the sinking and the jackrose romance was merely manipulative plot device get you emotionally into the think that understates the importance of the romance as found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die the iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour and it is an hour my goodness we do not miss second of that hour gratuitous well perhaps not todays standards am sure there is been far worse produced under the banner of entertainment in other films but certainly was not prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be not that would expect the word understatement be part of camerons vocabulary he who brought us such umm vivid films as terminator and aliens is it overdone thought so understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy no no one expected happy ending but did not quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half still whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked because was shocked and moved in fact spent most of the last hour in tears you really could not help but get emotionally involved whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack or that jack would rescue rose or that they would both survive perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along the ship freeze death on the water surface the bit where rose lets go of jacks hand while promising she will never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was pretty powerful image put no fine point on it loved the ending however was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and half so we have established that the is powerful and moving if the last hour was rather excessive have not mentioned the script plotwise it is ok though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed but have feeling that is the actors credit if anything as for the dialogue well titanic is set in it is period drama but saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned did they really use phrases like goddamn it back in the turn of the century doubt it would someone talk like this do ya love the guy or what doubt it is such dialogue as saw the iceberg and see it in your eyes now not just bit clumsy yes it is little more attention dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself is blame he wrote the script stick directing dude but its more than redeemed the acting dicaprio and winslet on fine form ably supported strong cast star of the show was gloria stuart though why did not she win that oscar after all they were throwing oscars at titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee directingwise cameron does spectacular job like said his vision was bit excessive but at least he directed it well have not even mentioned james horners beautiful score utterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack lot you do start get bit bored it have finished my rant lasted lot longer than thought it would just leaves couple of questions was it worth all those oscars hell do not talk me about oscars bloomin farce it was deserving in number of departments though last question is it as some suggest one of the best films of alltime nope do not think so it is certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films have ever seen but do not think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites and as for the fact they are reportedly making titanic well guess that is typical for you,1.0
in some respects rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking the hero is the renegade cop that prefers work alone the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element the duo must always be completely mismatched the hero has say some smartassed comment before and after shooting someone however that does not necessarily make for bad rush hour is jackie chans first major since the dismal the protector proving once again that can learn many things from foreign markets ie hong kong jackie chan is given much more free reign than before still some diehard jackie chan fans may be disappointed as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes he views as too short according one interview this takes familiar theme of east meets west jackie chan is lee the straight laced inspector who is imported help deal kidnapping case while chris tucker is carter the loudmouthed destructive cop that is promoted the fbi help him or at least so he thinks also another classic notion in action films the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes despite the necessary conventions of action films rush hour is some of the most fun you will spend and hour and forty minutes watching jackie chan continues be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen continuing perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences his flashy kicks and punches chris tucker familiar from his whiny annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable complementing jackie chans straightlaced character however jackie chan still maintains his comicslapstick edge as expected of him and his films perfectly downplaying the fishoutofwater routine through his characters attempts at mixing into american culture he makes up for the down time his character experiences when he is in action however you will be amused and dazzled still being inventive in the use of objects beat people up in this case steering wheel serving tray and barstool jackie chan proves be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu chris tuckers character may come across as irritating yet is also humorous since he is not physical actor the level of jackie chan he uses his main weapon his mouth hence the tagline fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare it is appropriate for the and still very funny while not necessarily poignant attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well lees knowledge of american pop culture that is the beach boys when contrasted against carters lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick while carter teaches lee hiphop dance moves while rush hour is not at the same level as police story and known in north america as supercop and jackie chans first strike respectively it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr nice guy its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs it makes for fun as well it is true departure from jackie chan films as it is missing one common element whiny female costar,1.0
my fellow americans is movie that at first glance looks have little substance or movie that we have all seen million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed do it in an interesting and funny way the movie starts quick and do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner william haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president there is scandal that arises involving kickback from contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago he finds scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead this movie was exceptional for many reasons one being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together they worked very well as unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being ladies man and one being the old man will let you fiqure is also they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well it seemed me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was congressman experience counts for lot,1.0
in the muse albert brooks plays steven phillips screenwriter who after winning humanitarian award for his work is dumped his studio they claim that he is lost his edge and his agent is quick agree them he knows that he needs write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over so he turns his best friend jack jeff bridges another screenwriter who is enjoyed success after success on the way over jacks house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman sharon stone into cab and begins think is he having an affair when confronted jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is in fact muse mythological figure who is believed have inspired all creativity and has helped him garner his success she does not do any actual writing he is told but inspires you steven is excited what he is hearing and asks jack call her up see if she will take steven on as new client jack arranges meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her present preferably something from tiffanys after the meeting the muse sarah decides take on steven but at price she wants suite at the four seasons and wants steven perform odd tasks for her like bringing her salads in the middle of the night stevens wife andy macdowell sees him at food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon steven confesses everything and although at first suspicious she later allows sarah move into their guest room and eventually into their life the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he is going through for her and that is question only time will tell the muse is albert brooks sixth as writerdirectoractor he cowrote monica johnson and although it is good movie it is not up the level of his best works defending your life and mother the problem lies in the script and for movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor there are not nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite few good oneliners it has great premise but does not deliver up it is full potential but like albert brooks in this and think that we can all identify steven phillips little bit he may whine and complain but he just wants support his family and be happy and like sharon stone in this movie too it is nice change of pace for her and also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner james cameron and martin scorsese and although the muse does not have as much say about as robert altmans the player still left the theater feeling good and that is something wish got out of more movies,1.0

i have admit that disliked this initially it certianly is not for every taste and it is sheer torture sit through if you are in restless mood that said if you are in the right mood it is absolutely incredible this was my second favorite movie of and would have been shooin for first in almost any other year perhaps the big turnoff for many was this films unconventionality would be hardpressed compare it any other that have seen it is very very artsy incredibly slow and amazingly it works beautifully on my second viewing realized that the follows the three act structure did not think it had any sort of structure at all when first saw it the first act serves set up the characters sort of it exists even moreso set mood of tension and restlesness and perhaps even feelings of boredom and then it is shattered the intense violence of the second encompasses most of the movie the majority of the is one extended battle scene intercut brief flashbacks and voiceovers the artsier elements do not detract from the action but add it they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers only be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes the battle scenes are amazing second only saving private ryan in my opinion they are brutal horrifying and at times beautiful due the amazing cinematography the second act is as immersive brilliant and haunting as any that have ever seen the only problems come during the first and third acts malick takes little too long get the started although the initial scenes consist of two soldiers experiencing nearedenlike paradise while going awol and the preperations for battle are effective and necessary hints of pretentiousness sink in the is just tad too artsy near the beginning and lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this the final act is effective at winding the down but the problems from the first persist it is bit too long and comes over as pretentious at times that said there are two sequences one where soldier gets devastating note from his wife and another where one of the main characters is killed that are nothing short of incredible the performances are phenominal all around the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel both of whom should have been nominated for oscars nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation his character is hard mean and somewhat reckless the lives of his men and yet nolte somehow manages evoke sympathy for him caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war his place in it and if there is any deeper meaning the hell that he is going through he is absolutely perfect genuine sympathetic sincere and yet strong when he needs be although restricted relatively small role sean penn is also very good as the companys pessimistic seargent as how it stacks up saving private ryan it was my second favorite movie of ryan was my first it is really hard compare the two they are so so different so will not beyond saying that spielbergs had more of an impact on me however the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality can easily see why someone would the thin red line above ryan highly recommend both of them and consider them be the two best war movies ever made all in all the thin red line is filmmaking of an incredibly high order it is slight faults are easily offset the sheer brilliance of what is done right it is real shame that it tanked at the box office films this unconventional powerful and thoughtprovoking do not come along very often,1.0
it was rainy friday afternoon in columbus when persuaded friend see matinee performance of mstk tm he had never seen any episodes of the show and have watched scant few due its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes for those of you not familiar the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes take over the world finding the worst ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme is missing in the movie bumped mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelsons reactions the movies he is forced endure rather than succumb the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow robot the format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on our heroes are marooned only two things are different in the movie the absence of forresters sidekick tvs frank and the slower pace of the jokes this latter change is presumably deliberate avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke for their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth classic and one of the first sf films have special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill unfortunately for that but making it ideal mstk fodder acting and dialogue appear have taken back seat the effects todays standards are less than impressive nelson co make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market star trek the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome and most of them work unfortunately the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and are not particularly funny but at least they are fairly short the big question about this movie though is why presume it was an attempt gain larger following keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition the big screen there are no special effects dazzle you no action sequences keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound so it seems pointless spend per person see this movie when in few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for and not have sit in room full of popcorn addicts nevertheless mstk tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any you are going see this year and thoroughly recommend it anyone pulse given its uniqueness hesitate grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies it does well,1.0

generated imagery cgi the character of stuart while obviously computer generated image grows on you as the progresses and you will soon see him as much more than mere special effect there is also great deal of animal training involved this as many of the supporting cast are actual cats computer animated mouths so they can speak it is fascinating watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse interact stuart little is charming family there are some great laughs in the movie script cowritten the sixth senses night shyamalan no less some moments that can only be described as too

countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally luckily movie reviewers are not burdened such legislation otherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored this reviewer in case of star wars science fiction epic george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans in any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best of all times those who do not usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery the author of this review must also concede his inability use cold objective standards in reviewing this like so many previous reviewers must note that watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that remained enchanted the experience ever since perhaps it was childlike fascination until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in galaxy far away or perhaps it was the rush felt minutes before the opening shots my expectations already pumped up serialised comic books and novelisation had read before anyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life and it was also unmatched for many years come because very few movies managed have such strong impact on me like george lucas epic star wars was not just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema until than american motion picture industry was in limbo social turmoil in practically destroyed the old and new authors filled the void mostly using hollywoods financial and technical resources create serious personal or artsy movies as result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate did not want see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen george lucas its science fiction epic was among the first come into rescue the audience responded unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began change the face of serious adult movies artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced industrial products of blockbuster philosophy one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre until science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain in late bigger budgets for science fiction did not look so strange anymore thanks the great success of space odyssey but the same success coincided the surge of pesimism and science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies however in star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually does not like it as result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued be filmed until early after that science fiction continued be considered synonym for family entertainment ironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered be member of new generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early george lucas established himself the dystopic sf movie thx and nostalgic drama american graffiti both movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular in sense star wars is an also very personal and the thorny way the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it but unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line the wishes of the general audience the plot set long time ago in galaxy far away begins in time of civil war the evil empire is threatened rebels who want restore the old republic in order quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough destroy whole planets the information about death star acquired rebel intelligence is being transported princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted imperial cruiser princess is arrested imperial warlord darth vader played david prowse and voice james earl jones but the information is being sent nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots cpo anthony daniels and rd kenny baker those two robots are sold the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants leave his farm and become space pilot his adventure begins when rd escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force after some hesitation luke agrees join obi wan in his mission save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force their small band comes the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew critics who do not like the movie especially those who cannot forgive lucas for his contribution the quashing of new are prone point the lack of originality on the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found lot of inspiration in the lore of old westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the and yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawas samurai classic the hidden fortress on the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted some mild tolkien references the others would find the authors element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes even out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as strictly technical piece of the seven art george lucas direction is very good the clever editing and wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup characters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and blockbuster we have comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned down due the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters some of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role date james earl jones whose voice is enough cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form unfortunately the same cannot be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character threedimensional enough launch his further acting career the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology often comparisons space odyssey another groundbreaking sf were citing the sheer number of effects as proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick however the special effects john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although special edition did improve them significantly yet they are not the most remembered trademark of the movie that honour should definitely go the oscar winning soundtrack john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough witness star wars original release yet even if they are immune the george lucas magic they should watch this nevertheless perhaps only become familiar something that is essential part of contemporary culture,1.0
frequency the number of times specified phenomenon occurs within specified interval as the number of repetitions of complete sequence of values of periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable etc do not worry when watching the thriller frequency you will not have know what the heck frequency means the premise although it may sound complex is very basic on the big screen new york cop john jim caviezel finds radio in his house allows him communicate his new york firefighter father frank dennis quaid who died thirty years ago immediately john warns his father that he will die trying stop fire in an abandoned warehouse when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he was not supposed the two eventually realize that changing that one moment in the past they have created whole new future in serial killer murders johns mother and nine other women it is now up john and frank use their special connection and save thirty years ago make present time better place told you that was not confusing overall was very pleased frequency it is occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized its suspenseful serial killer scenes usually do not buy those cheesy love you dad segments in movies but this one surprisingly satisfied me maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that believed that this is how most people would act when talking dead relative frequencys creepy premise left me thinking once the ended what if what would do would help my own family or save historical figure from being assasinated or stop some kids from shooting other kids or buy stock from yahoo character in the does the latter humorous consequences frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back the future both share that change the past slightly and you will change the future heavily warning the changes between the present and the past such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs are very similar both are also wonderful feelgood family films that can attract number of generations the only difference worth noting is that frequencys final scene does not set up possibility for lucrative sequel already in the making there are some problems the though first there is major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting email me if you have seen the movie and want know what think it is the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently no pun intended switch from while telling the story another problem is that the supporting cast including noah emmerich and andre braugher are underused while in the is not enough the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in frequency was pleasant surprise for me and the audience saw it who cheered at the end even if you know what is going happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you like it almost did for me check this movie out you may be surprised as well,1.0
psycho meets the exorcist no holds barred blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate ripoff but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argentos most consistently successful what impresses most in rewatching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argentos directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched nearfully coherent narrative screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions no question argento has always been better director than writer fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right suspiria taking his cue from book thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis the films storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of ballet school being front for coven of witches jessica harper plays an american who travels germany further her studies in dance arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees girl leave and run into the storm in clearly distressed state what happens next and do not make the comparison lightly is murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene in psycho it is quite possibly homage hitchcock but its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argentos own though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspirias opening minutes the continues be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes realise this is no ordinary ballet school we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played alida valli in another one of those delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles she does so well several more violent murders ensue including startling scene in deserted square where blind man is well would not want spoil things now would and the films climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has gothic ghoulishness that is most impressive the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about fortunately the cuts suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort conversation between harper and professor about the history of witchcraft in the region and the soundtrack it is interesting imagine what power the would have lost if it had been scored someone else as it stands the use of goblins music in suspiria is outstanding apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts stereo video player adds greatly the viewers overall experience even better see suspiria in cinema where you will get the added bonus of widescreen and the colours deep reds eerie blues superb use of shadow and contrast the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb nod also must go production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors these kinds of settings are crucial the atmosphere of argentos more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on bassan also worked suspiria is the that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status the gore is at times little excessive and overstated that is always been one of argentos shortcomings but overall this is fascinating compelling example of italian horror,1.0
jackie brown entered theaters little fanfare and lot of expectation even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings heightened anticipation this is after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction say he has been inactive in between would be tell falsehood since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn he was also called in at the last minute help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide am willing wager the debate over silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned him tarantino contributed on and off screen these films but never took the directors helm nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the scene and making john travolta star once more tarantino returns he can call his own the opens up an homage the graduate jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her jackie is flight attendant for air cabo flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas this makes jackie convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the s for ordell jackie is apprehended fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only the money but bonus of couple of ounces of illicit drugs jackie did not know they were in the package the cash but that is of no consequence the authorities who threaten jackie couple of years hard time if convicted of course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence get jackie turn over the big fish ordell ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up the police sure enough ordell shows up at jackies apartment that evening and tries silence jackie for good but she borrows maxs pistol and manages turn the tables on ordell instead of closing the irony circle and relocating bullet from the pistols chamber ordells head jackie proposes deal since ordell wants get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up her old tricks and be courier for him once more but this time for more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordells half million dollars gun in his face how can ordell not agree itself this premise might have been interesting enough carry the however we are also introduced number of double crosses make us pay attention and think jackie claims be bringing the money in for ordell but she is also making deal the feds as well as max the throws us off every once in while leading us believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually sham but it is in no way done the extent that we feel jerked around instead it is actually nice departure from the predictability is prevalent in so many of todays movies at least this has little imagination most of the performances in jackie brown are above par pam grier of whom had never taken notice before plays jackie mix of confidence and vulnerability makes her character believable samuel jackson has kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying do his best never mind that he belongs profession where sneaking into guys apartment zap him stun gun is simply matter of course he is just so downtoearth the nature of his job really does not occur us even when we are shown him bringing handcuffed woman prison or when we see the tools of his trade in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara recently paroled friend of ordells and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town unfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences in this he is not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much fonda on the other hand plays the slightly spacedout melanie satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side as is characteristic of any in tarantino has had hand the dialog is quick and snappy it grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown needs few visuals the lines are form of art in and amongst themselves do not count tarantino out when it comes using the camera however there is scene where max is unwittingly watching dry run of money exchange and he is not really sure what is happening but composing the scene just so his realization of what is going on is felt simultaneously the audience we look at the screen and think gee that is clever and then think the same thing about how the induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on although tarantino is not afraid drag out shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works varying degrees in this there are shots where character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head this is tribute both direction and acting however there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she is looking for but instead hoping she will just stop overall viewing jackie brown is time spent well some flap has already been made about the language used in the but it is really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today in fact one might even be able say that the way in these offensive words are employed almost cause them parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness go see the and see what mean,1.0

the rich mans wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so onedimensional and contrived that you know you should not be enjoying yourself but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin forgive it and get into the swing of things not that it is bad it is just that it is been done before and better in my opinion realize that this is going sound pretty bizarre but it is probably the best analogy that can come up right now you know how when you see spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy that is basically how felt about this movie mean it is not very good but it is not completely bad either the wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely halle berry she is married tony christopher mcdonald you know the guy who looks like joe piscapo really stressedout businessman who drinks way much and does not give josie the attention she deserves cough cough thus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen near the beginning of the josie decides try and work things out tony dumping jake and going on vacation remote cabin in the woods once there however tony has leave almost immediately due business details am still not quite sure what line of work he is in making the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars one night she meets stranger named cole peter greene finally getting meaty role they have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start realize that cole is homicidal after learning that she is not happily married cole offers take care of the problem managing escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts reconciliation her estranged and very wealthy husband but then one night cole shows up and here is where the fun begins from this point on it is going be noholds barred clichefest ripping off every movie from strangers on train the usual suspects this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out and for the most part they are right the rich mans wife has nary one original bone in it is body but who cares if you are looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you cannot do much better than this and if you suspense buffs are not already sold it has killer of an ending too,1.0
team of graphic artists and animators working on this first production from game developer squaresofts square pictures final fantasy inspired the topselling game franchise is visually aweinspiring and groundbreaking no doubt you have never seen anything like this and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved but why does such tremendous feat of eye candy have be weighted down problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting obviously the primary goal of the is stun and amaze audiences extremely sophisticated cgi everything you see in the is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they do not sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling but you will not spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow like the series of games final fantasys plot and characters have little do its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi it is the year and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun deadly alien phantoms whenever human comes in contact the ghostly visitors the ofteninvisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason while many humans agree plan monomaniacal general hein james woods blast the aliens zeus cannon dr aki ross mingna and dr sid donald sutherland plan build wave using eight collected spirits counteract the phantoms and kill them off while the images serve the scifi aspect of the well the storytelling does not it is unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out perhaps it was far too complex and enormous be entirely incorporated into the script some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was japanese concept translated english except two americans wrote the screenplay nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated confusing holes why do these aliens feed on souls if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them guns what is so special about the spirits that they would create force strong enough destroy the aliens worse yet the dialogue is scripted be either like scienceheavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or sappy love story depending on who is doing the talking for the most part it is bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines do not do anything help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments but when the lights come up and the credits roll you are more likely be remarking on how fantastic the looked there is no question that the roughly million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored the best cg animation ever put you would be living in fantasy world of your own if you expected much more,1.0
ladies and gentlemen independence day is here it is title starship troopers and surprisingly it is more entertaining than id realize that gave last years scifi hit star rating but was under the spell of the powerful first hour after subsequent viewings feel that independence day really was not as great as it seemedthough still give it positive review starship troopers on the other hand has mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem as result starship troopers is more exciting energetic and lively science fiction in fact probably could never get tired of watching this starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars another kickass space opera reinvented the scifi drama altogether while starship troopers is no star wars it comes quite close and the easiest assessment would be call this the star wars of the am being generous this perhaps but when science fiction comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races in essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction the easiest way write review of this would be compare it other science fiction films and may have starship troopers is not quite an original persay but director paul verhoeven gives the kickthealiensasses style id had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having major role this new star wars has very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species the alien species in question here is the bugs seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects however the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out deadly accuracy sometimes the morals are buried the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something tell us about our civilization more than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten the time the movie ends and they should be doubt verhoeven intended this be thoughtprovoking this is an event but surprisingly above average it is extremely refreshing watch scifi war and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads mixing webbased interface these summations of events are refreshingly original stating would you like know more these short news bulletins give the an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously however we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in gory yet funny way after witnessing the slaughter the jumps back one year setup what we just saw we are introduced johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts carmen sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms however carmen is not as interested in rico as she is in becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico unfortunately rico is not interested in dizzy this setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun watch carmen signs up become starship trooper and as result rico signs up and as result dizzy signs up everyone is assigned certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic gets position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers the mobile infantry the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships in reality found myself watching space version of melrose place but better special effects an hour into the the war begins sense of tension grew in the audience watched this the first hour may have been funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew care for the flat characters because no matter how hard tried not like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must following the training sessions had many dramas in themselves too many mention here the troopers are sent war the bugs live on the planet klendathu planet consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks sort of intelligence masterminds the defense the troopers are ordered locate the brain and capture it hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot it is about special effects and gory violence director verhoeven most known for his nudie showgirls and basic instinct returns his scifi days gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the sense of falsehood starship troopers is extremely violent more gore than this years event horizon the rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their year old children see it my guess is that verhoevens target audience is the male group the has testosterone level off the charts chiseled men and beautiful women despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates world made star wars so successful while watching the we never second guess the characters decisions because they seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face gives the flat characters some depth for we can identify the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying begin but they soon grow on you casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin will make most girls swoon most guys he will come across as artificial fortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries come off as real character dina meyer does much better job of fleshing out her character her dizzy is extremely likeable denise richards also does good job and her scenes are very well done jake busey gary buseys son gives wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the neil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is little wooden and slightly out of place the rest of the cast however he does give good performance michael ironside gives the best performance of the as the teacher one arm his performance rises above the rest perhaps it is because his character is the most developed but think it is just ironsides presence on screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives starmaking performance is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars director verhoeven is the main star of the his direction is fast and unrelentless he never slows down his pace makes for wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book robert heinlein the writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny the dialogue is smart but not too smart we are not required know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered thankfully we are not intended notice and we really do not except for one lingered in my mind for quite while amazingly all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages include some surprising governmental issues in fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer the story the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising find in of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage have not laughed this loud even in some comedies oh and the special effects are first rate starship troopers is rated for graphic scifi violence and gore and for some language and nudity believe me when say this do not take young kids see this it is extremely violent in fact it is probably the most violent out this year however if you are old enough over see it starship troopers is guaranteed entertain it is been long time since have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys and still it is my dream see scifi in the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world now that would be entertaining,1.0

i can sum up first strike in one word awesome never in my life have seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he is ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly the same tom and jerry formula that was used make chans rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that practice makes perfect his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great like rumble this is about the mafia the former kgb now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against group of very large bad men the trailer for the sums it up quite well first strike is actionpacked but the fight scenes are so fast and furious they almost have witty italianlike humor them jackie chan is regular comedian well he is no eddie murphy but he can really crack you up for example he is hanging off roof and he humorously taunts his foes come and get him as he claims be the korean that is secret agent james bond even the plot this improved above the others as sortof twisted nuclearweapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame but never fear as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident some of the most highflying stunts and sidesplitting comedy first strike is surefire hit that is guaranteed draw some major worldwide attention,1.0
as devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens have some idea of how ellie aroway jodie foster feels but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers cannot say that do exactly her reason is that she needs solid proof there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying prove they exist how can she say she does not believe in god because of the lack of proof and then say she believes in aliens are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like hypocrite that is the catch when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for device transport someone them okay well they did not really fax them ellie wants be the one go but because of her atheism she is denied the position how dumb is that she discovers the transmitions then she is not allowed go well because of bomb and psychopath jake busey she does end up going but not in the way that we would have thought contact is based on novel carl sagan who died during the filmmaking it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the rd kind and will end up being the best of the year its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some but will stimulate more am glad at least one movie of the can portray aliens in psitive light rather than bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body,1.0
now figured would seen every alfred hitchcock at least halfdozen times not that am complaining call him the master of suspense is an understatement the paradine case admittedly one of hitchcocks lesser movies turned out be one would missed this one like all hitchcock films is well worth savoring the story opens the rich mrs maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband as mrs paradine alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world franz waxmans stark and moody music we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels stripped of her fine raiment she becomes commoner again as it turns out was what she was before she met her husband brief skirmish and you will be lunching at the savoy again anthony keane her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting predicting fast and easy trial gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister she is no murderess he argues simplistically smitten her beauty she is too fine woman his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife gay ann todd unlike most hitchcock movies are centered on the thriller and the mystery this one is more romantic melodrama typical is the scene in gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light she deflects her husbands affections as she fears that he is beginning fall in love his client the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs paradines portrait nearby in the relatively unsatisfying first half little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs paradine acquitted because if mrs paradine dies his heart will go her if she is freed he will be able forget her as part of the soap opera mysterious louis jordan plays mr paradines valet who has had some not be discussed relationships charles coburn plays anthonys legal partner sir simon flaquer and charles laughton who looks like coburn is judge lord horfield this being proper british society they will all dine together at the judges house not long before the case begins court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences some subtle and others not between the american and the british judicial systems one for example of was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations as the judges wife lady sophie horfield ethel barrymore got nomination for best supporting actress the films only nomination for an inconsequential part she did little of merit so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walkon at minutes into the he leaves train station carrying large musical instrument case do not miss it in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high set the exact tone for the trials action as anthony explains it the simple case has only possibilities mr paradine poisoned himself mrs paradine did it or the valet did it the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid the paradine case runs the picture is in black and white it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested,1.0

quentin tarantino seems have knack for giving his stars big careers after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs john travolta made his comeback and is now one of todays most bankable stars bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor jackie brown on the other hand boasts quite well known cast except for the main lead pam grier most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but she is never really had breakthrough performance her first was in the roger ebertwritten beyond the valley of the dolls that is until now jackie brown is highly anticipated feature from quentin tarantino whose last was the huge hit pulp fiction after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns what made his name household one directing and writing jackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the giving one good performance after another pam grier gives stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported an incredible mix of talentsamuel jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster more than likely you will see few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations describing quentin tarantino is very difficult as you really cannot say much or you spoil it for everyone else will tread lightly jackie brown opens an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in blue outfit walking through the airport the camera tracks along her and ends up revealing her occupation we are also introduced ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns interested buyers for hefty price ms brown carries the money from buyer ordell in order keep the cops away however an fbi agent keaton and local a cop michael bowen are out find ordell and catch him while taking the money they try reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordells buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead they try again through brown but she is hesitant admit any wrongdoing but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordells friends fonda she is caught and sent jail ordell pays her bail through bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants find out what she told the cops after she claims have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order stay out of prison ordell does not like this but they both come up scheme throw the feds and cops off their track this scheme seems be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that is the biggest reason go see tarantino tarantino seems have fascination hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude their girlfriends of course this is tarantino and you know you can expect some awkward situations arise and perhaps the biggest flaw jackie brown is the slow middle section in the pace begins drop of course tarantino fixes this moving onto the climax of the adding lot of his reservoir dogsstyle storytelling it things are told from one persons perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more this all leads up very interesting conclusion decides who is on whose side on the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it the same style as he did his however this time around it is not as nearly as impressive or original the writing on the other hand is quite good although do find tarantinos use of slang terms offensive the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but it is much more easy understand his previous needed second viewing in order understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time perhaps this is result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch elmore leonard the dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized the cinematography is very well done guillermo navarro who has worked tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good and as pulp fiction the music is highlight bringing back memorable songs from the and the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable the performances are incredibly rich hidden meaning behind every characters actions nothing is quite as it seems and you cannot really tell side one person is on the real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown her poor living conditions are superceded her superior wits play an important role in the watching grieg could tell what was going through her mind even if did not know what she was thinking her face portrays lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought bridget fonda gives very good performance as druggie couch potato did not even realize it was fonda until saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather grahams in boogie nights michael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen chris tucker has small but effective performance samuel jackson is very good but it seems me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical but no matter jackson is very strong in his role robert de niro is actually little annoying at times but overall he does good job as one of ordells perspective clients and friends robert forster gives one of the best performances in the as he has one of the most developed characters he is present throughout most of the and he holds his own against jackson and grier jackie brown is rated for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks as itself jackie brown is terrific piece of entertainment complex plot draw viewers in however one can not help but compare it tarantinos pulp fiction and expect great results when compared it comes up short but not that short it is worthy effort terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as major actress cannot remember seeing her in anything except for small role in mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one expect see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even be able nab one,1.0

there are times when the success of particular depends entirely on one actors effort often single performance can turn what might have been rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile when one of these comes along usually try think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case the hurricane this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewisons the hurricane as per the tradition of referring belonging director but though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this works at all and his name is denzel washington washington plays carter boxer who in was convicted of latenight shooting in bar jailed for years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after second trial and countless appeals the situation changed when group of canadians moved washington and worked on freeing carter through the efforts of that group and carters lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted the details carters childhood had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of racist cop dan hedaya when he finally got out of prison for good carter became rising star as middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned flash forward when lesra vicellous reon shannon young africanamerican boy living group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes the injustice that was carters life and he vows help free the incarcerated boxer lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah work him towards his goal the hurricane leans on denzel washington he must carry virtually every scene sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly it is probably accurate say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope be it would perhaps be more accurate say that washington embodies the character of rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely for the the actors work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing keep the audience at arms length we feel everything he feels the humiliation of having return prison after fighting so hard make something of his life the pain of having order his wife give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming the conclusion that all hope is lost washingtons is performance of weight and emotional depth he does not merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level his work is masterful and for half of this realized that the scene was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor norman jewison directs the doing reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing his boxing scenes constructed clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage jewison puts together particularly nice scene utilizing pretty cool trick carter is sent solitary confinement for days when he refuses wear prison uniform and jewison assisted some wonderful acting from game washington shows how carter gradually starts lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing each other in one cell jewisons best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life and how he is able break out of that bitterness and learn trust people again sadly though the films chief failures lie the screenplay as most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts round the pike this winter there is much interest viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the gets chance take the most clich route possible it does take look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil carter and lesra played nicely shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is stereotype the canadians are good the cops are bad the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their loveydovey commune and it is commune despite the films failure make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison loves gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during everyone gets make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from madefortv lifetime special it is too bad the cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often wanted real reason for the cop hold grudge against carter other than he is racist pig wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people faults and virtues instead of bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice in short wanted see the through less distorted lens criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes the truth of what really happened carter and much of it is deserved for example the gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only be screwed the judges who ruled giardello the winner most accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly furthermore much of carters criminal past is conveniently left out of the and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained of course the hurricane works mainly as fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues do not remove one fact the hurricane is highly flawed only one actor could have made schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and it is good thing the hurricane has that actor carter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but he is not the only one washington makes this look good denzel washingtons the hurricane sounds pretty good me,1.0
contact is nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagans only novel it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster we first meet ellie at giant radio telescope in puerto rico where she is part of the seti search for

allow one person travel the aliens home world of course the big question becomes who gets ride it right after who is gonna pay for this thing boil it down ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently keep godless science from talking god or something like that then hadden reappears startling news he has secretly constructed second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie in whom he has taken rather paternal interest ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole dreamlike place that looks lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father david morse when she returns home no one believes her she was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for hours her story is officially discredited although believed large segment of the public who do not even have know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static eighteen hours worth of static there is lot like about contact so will highlight those points first ellie arroway is wellrounded character portrayed one of the best actresses currently working neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs but that is tough standard meet ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined strange array of father figures her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the but love his daughter unconditionally drumlin comes across as distant stepfather whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants use his toys get into trouble hadden obviously has affection for ellie but in the end he seems see her as his creation nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board even palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellies love interest takes paternalistic interest in ellie seeing her as misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses the is technically impressive especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine the part of the dealing the message has the best presentation of real science in since the andromeda strain the falls apart when dealing its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion this is very real debate but contact boils it down simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved the presents science pretty well until the end so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith religious people are presented as shallow caricatures rob lowe plays ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice of the religious right another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine jake busey the only really fleshedout religious person palmer joss is supposed be minister of some sort but his actual faith is left pretty vague cannot even say for certain that he was supposed be christian all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about premarital sex the drops the science ball at the very end when ellie appears assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith in day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced the religion right as an atheist religious doctrine this is exactly the wrong message send in movie dealing issues of science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism what ellie should have said was you should not believe me not without evidence and do not have the evidence know what happened but you should not take my word alone that is the voice of science speaking the character of david drumlin is another problem this his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for person in his position also his profession of faith before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only pack of idiots should have fallen for it the last big problem is the use of real personalities in various roles the media figures such as bernard shaw and jay leno are not so bad in as much as their participation was voluntary the use of bill clinton however should give anyone pause first of all lifting the image of sitting head of state and inserting him into fictional story line thus using his words outside of the context in they were spoken is just plain creepy also using the real president places this between and forever dating it people watching this in the future will say hey this never took place during clintons term this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief also the level of technology portrayed in the is too advanced take place before the first decade of the next century better have had fictitious president played an actor or no president at all the does raise an interesting question although it never develops it in satisfying way if we were picking an emissary send an alien culture would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes belief in god or at least some form of supernatural creator personally would hope not since religion is basically an opinion form of ideology would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task,1.0
david cronenberg presents us another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future the story unfolds in near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are hiding in virtual reality fantasy games escape the uncertainty of the real world allegra geller jennifer jason leigh the leading game designer in the world is testing her new virtual reality game existenz focus group as they begin she is attacked fanatic assassin employing bizarre organic gun she flees young marketing trainee ted pikul jude law who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard unfortunately her pod an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program is damaged inspect it she talks ted into accepting gameport in his own body so he can play the game her the events leading up this and the resulting game lead the pair on strange adventure in world where individuality does not exist as the players are forced perform as characters in an unknown plot here the reality and their actions are impossible determine from either their own or the games perspective do not intend reveal more of the films premise is structured as computer game tasks that the characters must complete win the game released after the matrix and dark city existenz has some similarities and parallels that connect it these films however existenz is moving in different direction premise of its own combination of dazzling special effects brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot made the matrix rare and entertaining science fiction experience some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade existenz has completely different atmosphere resembling dark city is darker more serious and less entertaining existenz has the opportunities and potential but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored after the engaging beginning it starts falter while was watching the many left the theatre during the first hour and indeed existenz seemed as complete failure the actors seemed unreal the plot and dialogue silly unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another but the last fifteen minutes lifted the on complete different level explaining all past events the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within few scenes and jet the fails on several issues probably the best written character in the story is game designer who would rather spend the rest of her life in virtual world than face real life this is great possibility create magnificent character and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenbergs script the limits but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison the real world are never shown existenz is not world of you might dream about in your fantasies it is not world worth sacrificing your life for it is cold dark place where the players are forced interrelate unreal characters eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will it does not look like place worth even thinking about david cronenberg has been the creator of the fly videodrome and the dead zone so it is not so hard guess that existenz is violent and gory besides the regular murders of innocent people the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of twoheaded mutated amfibium scenes like that have become trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he cannot make without flowing blood and foul creatures the way see it this is the films crucial failure it is impossible for cronenbergto create beautiful world where time space and problems of our everyday life do not exist place of blooming blossoms green forests and clear waters place really worth sacrificing your life for because of its lack of three dimensionality the looses most of its possibilities but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes amusing performances especially willem dafoe and one interesting and important thought depicted in many different ways throughout the movie during the the audience is as confused as the characters detached from their everyday existence and no longer able see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created the matrix despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts ends light at the end of the tunnel existenz does not it is one time experience ending in blood gore and madness rather frightening forecast for tomorrow,1.0
seven is one of the best mystery movies have ever seen it is extremely intriguing and suspenseful but it is also quite fun it is serial killer mystery but you do not care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer the story is copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery someone is murdering people who are offenders of the seven deadly sins fat man gluttony was forced eat himself death lawyer greed is slaughtered his own rich possessions could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much what makes this so unique is the characterization of the good guys makes the unseen villain seem so vile brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills the cocky rookie however morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset the wise veteran on the verge of retirement and he does not get killed the end there is great sense of camaraderie here often provides for breath of comic relief this is impressive because the mood is so tense and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here let alone at all is quite an accomplishment the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able give the city feeling of the evil scary place many believe it be the production design is superb in the spirit of batman and the crow this embodies the gothic mood the way the words fade in and out along the freaky nine inch nails music really add lot the story on subconscious level even the credits are scary the killers victims have no connections at all and thus mills and sommerset do not have much go on solve the case they can only wait for the next murder occur makes for tremendous suspense we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this the only problem had the is the way in mills and sommerset are lead suspect let us just say it seems little too mystery movie or too convenient in other words when they are led suspect the name of john doe terrific chase scene ensues this is typical thrilling element but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story if anything this is the epitome of twist endings do not have tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal but the way in this happens is surprising there is scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives and even though he is obviously insane his charisma makes for some good points what is even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes terrific climax as the films resolution comes down question of what justice really is seven is not just about crime but about the evil within man john doe felt he was doing society favor ridding it of scum but as justified as he makes himself seem we must never be tempted such twisted ideals of justice,1.0
after hearing reviews for woody allens upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring just soso my heart lept when the opening images of the closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time woody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand manhattan really is one of the bestlooking films have ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas etc fan cannot help but feel visibly moved the opens up the usual credits plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills gorgeous dull gray sky the word help being spelled an airplane beethovens th blasts on the soundtrack the city seems stop take notice of this moment and it is all rather lovely look at and then we cut crew shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the where the lead actress in the melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has realize somethings wrong her life or whatever it is terribly stale scene for woody allen the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and soon got used the fact that once again new of his was not going be as great as his past works though for the record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened him the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony pull farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than really great story everyone says love you was more of great idea than great even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films if anything the reception of celebrity everyone should tip allen off the fact that this time it is not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his is it is him celebrity is yes good but it is only marginally satisfying as woody allen instead of creating the great woody allen world he is created world out of subject he knows only bit about and he is fashioned that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like series of skits minor connections it is like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures is hardly wartsandall impersonation branagh brings along him little of the woody allen charm actually allows for his characters flaws be more apparent woodys flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he is really funny and really witty and really intelligent branaghs allen is bit more flatout bad but the same charm so that yes we like him but we are still not sure if he is really good person or not his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off interview griffith who takes him her childhood home where he makes pass at her and she denies him sorta we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying be celebrity thanks midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion he has since quit his job as travel journalist and become gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script bank robbery movie but deep personal crisis as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend girlfriend and fling fling over the course of the after griffith comes his escapades model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita following are his safe relationship smart working woman famke janssen relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades ryder whom he fancies most of all his story is juxtaposed that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her job that furthers her career national status while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy have become the kind of woman have always hated and am loving it without doing thing the result is of highs and mediums the mediums are what take up most of the sitations and scenes do not exactly work but you cannot help but pat allen on the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence theron is so good that wished it had not ended banana scene bebe neuwirth droll as ever and perhaps the best sequence romp hotashell teen idol brandon darrow played none other than leo dicaprio who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this they would never look at him the same way he ignites the screen intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes him talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on wild allday ride him they go atlantic city watch fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies allens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them would almost recommend the almost but what really liked about this is despite the fact that it is mess despite the fact that what this really needs is good old fashioned rewrite allen himself it is still smart and insightful though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages get across that this is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem be if it were it would be extremely outoftouch but about those who want be celebrities and how they equate celebrityhood happiness we never get close enough the actual celebrities see if they are really happy they may appear be on the surface but we do get close enough lee and davis character lee is obsessed the phenomenon while davis takes is at arms length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself besides it is witty and it does have the one thing that no other has but allens that great woody allen feel it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as part of woody allens oeuvre it is merely blip no annie hall but it is no shadows and fog either but it goes prove that no one can make like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice,1.0
an astonishingly difficult movie watch the last temptation of christ may be scorseses most important and yet his most impossibly abstract as well scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel details the life of christ from approximately until the day of crucifixtion jesus of nazareth dafoe is carpenter who opens the making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected his destiny on earth yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey prostitute who is also childhood friend of jesus after going the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do aided judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries teach the world his message christ is also confronted internal demons and selfdoubt as he tries find his true purpose throughout the entire during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the was not out of hate but out of love in order allow christ die he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile however as he is about die on the cross he is saved girl who brings him his marriage mary magdelene the girl is guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death jesus goes on live life as man as carpenter and does not die on the cross on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited the prophets and judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain judas reveals the angel truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived be the ultimate selfish act jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing his last temptation visually and aurally the is absolutely breathtaking no other director has even come close realizing jerusalem during the time of christs life the screen peter gabriel contributes score than is simply astonishing pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer the performances are simply exquisite dafoe leading the way mesmerizing turn as jesus keitel although his accent is problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language bring the character life the visuals are also amazing scorsese frames his movie in harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is man who is having human frailties the though has many trouble spots paul schraders script is one schrader uses modernday new york english tell the story along new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech the also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ there is no underlying message behind the mans words the fails capture the glory and splendor of christ had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness the is also overlong it just drags in the middle nothing truly happening christ is confused figure in the sense that the audience does not know who he really is schrader forgets give jesus message show that he truly is the messiah give him the divinity without that he is rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting preach there are moments of brief awe and power followed moments of confused hilarity that said the controversial temptation sequence is something behold it is step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples it is simply breathtaking scene jesus about die as mortal it is truly one of scorseses finest moments it is unfortunate that scorsese could not make about christ as powerful as that one scene,1.0
call me crazy but do not see saving private ryan as the of the summer good movie yes chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion spare an utterly riviting movie on par steven spielbergs best work no personally if was spielberg would not go back the world war ii era one more time after schindlers list and the indiana jones movies am guessing steve has thing for nazis really would not be surprised if velociraptor ate one of the swastikawearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie all lofty pretenses aside saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of s slasher flick the difference is it is easy during friday the th laugh off spear sticking out of kevin bacons chest while blood spurts like crazy but it is damn hard sit and eat reeses pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield and believe me there is plenty of it minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain tom hanks and his soldiers landing at omaha beach join countless other americans who are already under fire lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on and all the young men in the audience find themselves never ever wanting be drafted cut some bureaucratic defense office where hundred women pound out sympathy form letters the families of the casualties one woman happens upon an interesting detail three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat and their mother is getting the telegram today guess it is an interesting conversation piece everyone but the mother so the army chief harve presnell sends hanks on what is essentially public relations mission find the fourth ryan brother and send him home that way the army saves the postage on yet another telegram mrs ryan one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed rescue ryan know it is mission designed make the army look good they question the worth of risking eight soldiers lives save one and hanks character admits he does not give damn about ryan he is just following orders if this was john wayne movie things would be different there would be phony let us go get that boy gosh darn it attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war doing things this way spielberg admits the instincts of self preservation and complacency that every normal person has it makes saving private ryan lot more powerful than an testosteronedriven stallone movie mission the movies pattern is have long battle scenes followed quiet scenes of semiintrospective conversation among the soldiers hanks is painted first as nailstough army man careful hide his true self from the other men it is not that way for long edward burns the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck is not available is the impulsive one jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time and so on none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes but was spielbergs obvious intention wondered when heard saving private ryan was three hours long how were they going fill three hours time searching for one person and still make it interesting there are few false starts hanks finds one private ryan in ted dansons company apparently danson joined the army after ink was canceled and breaks the bad news before learning it is the wrong ryan and of course the movies far from over when hanks does locate ryan matt damon the other guy you get when affleck is not available that is when the movie turns into more of conventional war flick although body parts and limbs still fly like never before saving private ryan is worth your time but it is definitely no schindlers list the battle scenes are intense and realistic but some of the attempts at sincere emotion are not the movies bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place when an old private ryan goes the cemetary his family and bawls his eyes out whining tell me have led good life tell me am good man spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any threehour movie about the past should be framed selfcontained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present much more effective are subtler scenes like the one where several of hanks men are rifling thrugh bag of dogtags from dead soldiers and they make light of what they are doing pretending they are playing poker this while an airborne division marches their eyes full of that mound of dogtags not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war the audience gets the message and even if it is not classic saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there,1.0
seen august at m at rotterdam square cinemas rotterdam ny theater myself for free using my sonyloews critics pass theater rating good seats sound and picture war is topic that cannot help but be glorified any way it is portrayed the media movies documentaries and even history books have way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on such as strategy politics and victory it is easy forget war in its most basic form is battle of armies out slaughter each other forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier no matter what his rank or importance is real fleshandblood person and not just number saving private ryan is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect especially in its unapologetic realistic delivery it proves there is huge difference between battling and killing the opens one of the most graphic disturbing scenes in recent memory it is world war ii dday be exact and the s military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them spielberg uses many techniques create for total sense of reality instead of positioned cameras the footage here seems have been shot camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared there is no sense of stability but of constant anxious and confusing motion giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle and just vulnerable as the poor troops poor is proper word describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are there is little no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue define any characters we do not get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles but that these are men about kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding the nazis are not portrayed as enemies be hated but as people that must be destroyed because they are there in the movies the good guys can run through firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get scratch but in reality that would not happen the men have nothing shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the wellsecured germans who can actually see who what and where they are shooting unlike the americans who must fire in general direction avoid getting their heads blown off perhaps the is flawed not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are but that seems be part of the theme the seems rely on the audiences sense of patriotism that the american military is right and good and that the nazis are inherently evil the battle scene eventually focuses on group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close the enemy stronghold whole foot progression and begin inflict some damage have admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up could not help but feel some sense of joy and relief triumph against all odds is cliche be sure but there is nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because it really happened one of the most surprising aspects of the is how little story construction there is and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting the plot is practically irrelevant since the is more concerned the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet tom hanks stars as captain miller relatively average man who happens be the leader of platoon he is never obsessive or any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate character like this he does not want be there any more than his men but when he is given mission he intends carry it out the mission the is concerned is as the title states saving private ryan through series of command started an ordinary clerical worker it is brought generals attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of eachs death simultaneously when they learn fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe they make it top priority have him returned safely his mother it is easy sympathize this situation after all no one should have lose all their children at once but finding one man in this war is as miller puts it like trying find needle in stack of needles the saving of private ryan is not just dramatic device but thematic one his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country the world even was trying convince itself it still had when millers company hears of the mission they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead but miller is not so quick shrug it off he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope and now he has the opportunity make someones sense of hope reality the mission find ryan gives millers group destination but not direction along the way many things happen them both good and bad few battles are fought not be major accomplishments for the war but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice the act of killing itself becomes one of the films major philosophical metaphors the soldiers do not mind killing other soldiers in blind battle but when they come across lone survivor who begs them let him go they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses unfortunately death is fact of war and most films try avoid it when it comes the main characters but here spielberg does not want us think these men are invincible in fact only small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man and the performances are good enough make this method work although the characters are somewhat typical the actors maintain control over the material at all time whether they are arguing each other telling stories of back home or fighting the germans they never go overboard and always seem believable sure there is zinger here and there but war does not change the fact boys will be boys if and when one dies we too can feel the loss even though we hardly knew them the final act brings the story full circle another tremendous violent battle sequence private ryan has been found but facing four one odds can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive that is not premise for thrills it is symbolic of everything the has worked for it would be wrong say the has either happy or sad ending it ends the way it must end remember reading calvin hobbes comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like dad how do armies of men killing each other solve problems saving private ryan is the adult version of that question,1.0
lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie ok so maybe it is but this one is enjoyable and clever actually it comes off more of comedy than horror well the ending is kinda scary but in most horrorcomedies they are will admit that lake placid is not an oscar worthy but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny bridget fonda plays palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating is forced go lake placid and investigate tooth after man is bit in half she gets there but really does not understand why she is there bill pullman plays man also investigating what happened along the sherriff and rich croc obsessed man they go out and find what is going on what they find though is not great huge and mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid over years old he has migrated here for who knows why they have fight against the croc and try trap him so they can study him and see where he came from betty white plays woman who lives on the shores of lake placid and well you will have see the movie find out her character is very funny and foulmouthed is surprising hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad but funny me the movie came off as spoof of jaws the opening sequence and some others it is not original and is when you watch this movie you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it david kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal writes this movie ease and surprisingly does great job the characters have smartmouths two foul and some great oneliners but believe me do not take lake placid too seriously or you will not like it but it is movie that can be enjoyed as fun popcorn type movie but guess it rates above the popcorn rating sit back watch the movie laugh scream and whatever you want even though the movie is and put violence and gore there is really not that much gore but what there is might seem kinda gross some lake placid is smart clever funny and scary movie that enjoyed and think you will too,1.0

what if one of our cities became the target for terror what can we do what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism what basic human rights are we willing sacrifice prevent another oklahoma city disaster so far america has been the leading nation opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world it is the land of opportunities it is the land of freedom but what if it became the new target this dark fantasy has unfortunately very strong grounding in reality when special branch of the united states military under the command of general william devereaux bruce willis takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice the only warning the fbi receives is single cryptic message release him then all hell breaks loose in new york bus is destroyed killing civilians broadway theater is bombed hostages are taken at school as the wave of terrorist activity crests the president must consider if the only way save the city and break the grip of fear is declare martial law devereaux argues against that eventuality but is nevertheless ready lead men into action on american soil another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard denzel washington the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities his staff is comprised of smart energetic intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group f moronic feds we are used seeing in movies hubbard develops an uneasy alliance cia agent elise kraft annette bening whose department knows more about the situation than they are willing reveal but the attacks escalate the fbi are helpless chasing an invisible enemy the land is under siege they have lost control terror is coming from within what is great about this is that it is made as if holding up mirror life it reflects reality and that is why it makes such an impact edward zwick has created clever well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season the director manages tell several stories simultaneously and so his plays on several levels never loosing focus on its main objective he is exploring the abuse of power the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the s government the army the fbi and the cia he takes look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved the palestinian community in new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii there are concentration camps and unlawful interments all in the name of the greater good in the latter part of the the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul freedom was that what the terror ists really wanted this has evoked protests and objections from the arabamerican population in the s and y especially but me these protests seem unnecessary zwick is careful not step over the line and make the palestinians typical bad guys the script is therefore wonderfully balanced agent hubbards best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad tony shalhoub is lebaneseamerican and it is quite often you hear lines such as my first boyfriend was palestinian they seduce you their suffering or they love this country as much as we do but no matter how you twist this matter you will not get away from the fact that when it comes world wide terrorism it is arabspeaking population who are in the great majority more the point the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group depicting the unfair treatment of all arabamericans the s military and thus this does not serve as source for discrimination in any way denzel washington is dashing as always in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual anette bening is enjoyable and believable as shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage network of snitches and seduction gather information bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist hungry for power that never looses his connection the audience since his point of view is not too hard understand the is elegantly shaped the scenes are easily floating into each other and the never seems overlong zwick knows exactly how provoke tension horror and emotions and does it rarely observed professionalism he tightens the intensity as the events progress and when plot twist comes it actually is surprising it is not drained in patriotism like the work of roland emerich nor is it that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values it is daring picture that has courage enough undertake such risky story and difficult journey it has courage enough get involved in politics it questions our foreign policies mentality and defense must admit that it ends rather disappointing as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down but despite of that it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling that provokes emotions and thoughts virtue that few summer films can boast of this is the s army it is broadsword not scalpel believe me you do not want us in an american city gen william devereaux the siege,1.0
desperate measures was something was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled be released summer for some reason it was delayed until hollywoods traditional dumping ground january now that it is out see no real reason for that delay as it is simple yet highly entertaining michael keaton stars as maniacial murderer who is bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of san francisco police detective garcia keaton agrees the transplant only so he can attempt escape he succeeds in plan that of course could only work in the movies the police force is now trying kill keaton while garcia is working against them trying keep keaton alive in order save his son the definately has it is flaws the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status also after keatons escape garcias captain barks at him how many men have die save your kids life the treats as such an evil and insignificant remark the thing is it is vaild point how many people have be needlessly crippled burned and killed just save this one child what is the greater good here many lives or one life if movies really had guts nowadays would have loved have seen this movie come down final choice for garcias character place him in situation where he knows that he has kill keaton because keaton is about kill someone else alas movies these days generally have no such ambition pull the audiences strings in ways might make the uncomfortable despite few silly moments and one or two really stupid ones the good things about desperate measures outnumber the bad the main highlight would be keatons performance the character could have easily been an overacting scene chewing freak but keaton underplays it nicely he is not as menacing as he was in pacific heights or even as menacing as he was in batman yes kids batman used be dark character but you certainly get the idea that he is evil even the final scene of the normally would just hate seems strangely appropriate for this so much so that did not mind it in the slightest and another bonus the takes place in san francisco usually means car chase on those hills that you have seen billion times before and for moment it looked as though it was about happen but it does not and that is creative r,1.0

this is good year if you want plenty of scifi on your multiplex from the comedies mars attacks and men in black luc bessons powerful the fifth element and this scifihorror that is event horizon more is on the way contact and alien ressurection being released later this year the story is thus in an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out newly invented gravity drive device that enables craft travel anywhere in the universe instantaneously this is achieved creating gateway infact black hole between the craft and it is required destination in this case from near neptune proxima prime however when the event horizon attempts this it dissappears without trace leaving two searches for it fruitless seven years later it reappears transmitting distress signal and this is where the starts search and rescue ship is sent out investigate the team is led laurence fishburne and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive as the team search the event horizon they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around not good sign make matters worse as they search the ship they find themselves being subjected series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse some very bloody events start occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago it soon becomes apparent that wherever the ship went it bought something back it something very very evil the first thing you will notice in this is it is incredible visual effects they really are eye popping some great models boot the acting is quite good some occasional witty moments sam neill does good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues but tip of the hat goes laurence fishburne who leads the team in cool calm take no nonense manner it is his acting skills that help hold this together the idea behind event horizon is certainly good one it starts off incredibly well but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur however the closing minutes of the more than make up for this producing one the most nail biting or in my case straw of my drink biting climaxes have recently witnessed overall event horizon is smart indeed it is very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals but be warned the horror scenes despite being very brief are very very gory not for the squemish,1.0
scarface remake of the of the same name is very gripping and as far as know truetolife story of how power and violence lead corruption al pacino as tony montana for whom the movie is named also provides brilliant performance as cuban refugee who comes america less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles the begins disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans set sail and head for the coasts of the united states many of these cubans had criminal records such as tony montana cocky fasttalking man who has the look of crime nearly right after his arrival in miami tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in cocaine buy that goes awry along his friend and partner manolo steven bauer tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms friendship frank lopez robert loggia highroller in the organized crime field tony also begins fall in love elvira michelle pfeiffer who at the time was franks lover of course sooner or later in this industry betrayal and corruption amount into force greater than anything else and tony is one of the ones who fall victim this force this is not before he becomes one of the most respected and often feared men in miami tony gets the point where he cannot trust anyone and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him no one can trust him and basically no one does scarface although incredibly violent is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance it truly is very good one in fact his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind win at least nomination although he did get golden globe nomination another element that stands out when someone mentions this is the profanity figure tagged the boasts that the word fuck and it is uses are uttered times throughout the is apparently record the thing is the vulgarity fits rather well the movie as odd as it sounds it is true in the end scarface is very powerful that hits home hard,1.0

if you are the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland you are going love the hunt for red october you will also love the if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if you are sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernans earlier films die hard and predator in fact the only people likely be disappointed the hunt for red october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up the novels inspired them the hunt for red october is an epic thriller adapted from tom clancys best selling novel set in an era before glasnost the movie revolves around topsecret soviet submarine called the red october the nuclear sub has revolutionary propulsion system makes the vessel silent and allows it escape sonar detection the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius played sean connery ramius has strict orders just test the submarine but he has other ideas he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean is he planning start world war iii cia analyst jack ryan does not think so he is convinced that ramius plans defect the s ryan played alec baldwin is given three days prove his theory and find the missing sub the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin but the performances thankfully are rock solid baldwin and connery anchor the their customary vigor sam neil gives sturdy performance as connerys somber first officer it is ironic see neil and connery playing russians since they are both best known for their roles as british agents connery as james bond and neil as reilly ace of spies the large cast also includes scott glenn james earl jones tim curry and joss ackland plus richard jordan as the smooth s national security adviser the special effects are remarkable but more than anything the hunt for red october is distinguished its watertight plot screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through story line full of twists and turns they keep us involved in the action unveiling plot strands at just the right moment the movie does not get as sweaty or breathless as die hard because it would rather tell good story than hit you over the head nonstop action the finale is rousing and suspenseful but essentially the hunt for red october is superior potboiler,1.0
i was pleasantly surprised this budget topping million was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth centurys greatest tragedies would make exciting enough see how much could you dress up the sets how many models and computer effects could you use how much more action could you pack into ship that sinks oh if have just given away part of the plot for you go back school after having viewed titanic however found it be wellpaced welldesigned and overall wellmade movie there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best have seen titanic tells its story in two time periods it starts out in the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic searching for priceless diamond necklace supposedly went down the ship what they find instead is drawing of woman wearing the necklace is broadcast on the news the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett who has her flown out his exploration vessel on the high seas there she tells her story lovett and his team in rose dewitt bukater kate winslett young lady belonging societys upper class boards the titanic for the ships first atlantic crossing from southampton england new york she is engaged cal hockley billy zane an heir old money and snob in every sense of the word on board rose feels the stifling trappings of highsocietys expectations and resolves escape from it all throwing herself off the titanics stern but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate jack dawson leonardo dicaprio passenger in thirdclass steerage as it is referred who talks her out of jumping although for rose the attraction is not immediate love affair soon develops between the two endangers roses social standing as well as her engagement the jealous cal the story sounds very simple and perhaps even unexciting but through solid performances the leads and good direction cameron good movie comes through dicaprio is marvelous as the young but worldlywise jack playing the role the confidence usually found in older actors his is character that is immediately likable as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able handle variety of situations girls are going swoon over him winslet also proves herself good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable the only problem winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance her characters upbringing simply judgment of her gait was distracted from the fact that she was supposed be an uppercrust debutante rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character possess she sometimes looks positively clumsy and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal since he has certain look that immediately makes you want hate him his features are such that even when he smiles there is something mistrustful about him and when he scowls he is evil incarnate he is something like porcelain version of peter gallagher but cheaper model like dicaprio and winslet zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy cals personal assistant or man as they said at the turn of the century no matter who else is in the cast you can always count on good performance warner who seems be made play the distinguished gentleman gaze of steel and will match additionally there are number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color such as kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown danny nucci as jacks friend fabrizio de rossi eric braeden as john jacob astor and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie nice see dr bombay getting work also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die this itself may have been largely compulsory in about the titanic but it transcends this status putting these characters in direct conflict the ships crewmembers who strive maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else in this way titanic possesses depth not usually found in action pictures you do not just get love story tragedy as backdrop but very real account of class struggle as well as mentioned before the budget for this was tremendous and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic regard the exteriors would dare anyone point out in vessel has been recreated such meticulousness or on such scale cameron actually built scale model of the titanic in water tank but only had room for and therefore had computergenerate the remaining feet could have fooled me and everyone else in the theater as the splicing is seamless also of note in this is the way the audience is presented the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship how the flooding occurred the way the ship sank and why it did so in that manner these technical details serve as guide for later on when the action starts happening and allow us view the sinking informed analytic detraction in addition the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion in all james camerons titanic is good blend of love story history and action the fact that the runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewers attention is held alternately those three main elements from the movies intriguing beginning it is satisfactory ending in box office receipts titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship,1.0
it was easy fear the worst begin classic television series add big budget and an alist star in the lead role and stir script you ask who needs one kid we have got ourselves formula that was my fear bloated monster without any sense of direction then much my amazement everything that could possibly go wrong did not the fugitive is as lean taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years under the direction of andrew davis under siege the fugitive grips you the throat from the outset and never lets go expect box office go through the roof deservedly and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones the premise is simple one dr richard kimble harrison ford is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling the real killer man an artificial arm after an escape attempt some other prisoners during transfer goes awry kimble finds himself on the run his one goal find the onearmed man andreas katsulas before s marshall sam gerard tommy lee jones finds him where the fugitive surprises the most is the script jeb stuart and david twohy in genre where one is almost always asked allow leaps of logic the script repeatedly astonished me its intelligence its attention detail and its respect for the audience in an early sequence kimble sneaks into hospital shave of his beard slick back his hair and change into lab coat on his way out police officer jokingly tells the man he does not know is kimble zip up his pants it is small moment but it punches home the urgency of kimbles situation and exactly what man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget later while trying lose himself in parade kimble thinks drop his overcoat the most likely way he would be recognized from behind it is these details convince us that when colleague of kimbles tells gerard that he is too smart be caught he may just be right credit must also be given the special effects and stunt coordinators the bus crash allows kimbles escape is spectacular sequence as is leap from dam into the water below the action is crisp and brutal and never romanticized special kudos go director davis for maintaining relentless pace underscores the singlemindedness of the two leads and what pair of performances those leads are tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard because he manages an incredibly challenging feat for the first third of the there is really no villain per se kimble is on the run and gerard is out find him it would have been very easy turn gerard into malevolent vindictive inspector javert but that never happens instead jones plays him as sharp committed man who is just doing his job so that when he responds kimbles comment did not kill my wife matteroffact do not care we know exactly what he means it is not his job determine guilt or innocence it is his job bring in fugitive this is well written character played relish an actor at the top of his form the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that it is likely overshadow harrison ford and that is shame for his entire career ford has been underappreciated as an actor due his pigeonholing as an action hero however he does fine job the less flashy part of kimble always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence the fugitive could only work its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed be on equal footing and ford is up the task this summer has been loaded actionsuspense films and most of them have been doing brisk business however it is time for clint sean and various dinosaurs step aside the chase is on my advice is catch it,1.0

it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system no major surprise when s mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either the americans are wrought the archetypal paradox under they exist the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority small wonder that hollywoods most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individualunderdog against some larger collective oppressive witness braveheart born on the fourth of july rocky first blood clear and present danger jfk the list goes on there is little of that in singapore we are barred access playboy and penthouse both on and off line though the governments been long worried about the younger people getting americanised and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition the people vs larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america sex does pornography have right exist and circulate larry flynt the publisher of hustler magazine thinks so and obviously so too the s congress last month threw out bill curb pornography on the net but even such actions americans remain undecided the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire what they have ignored is actually great picture woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as tohellwithmorality tohellwiththelaw and tohellwiththesystem antichrist that we last saw in natural born killers and he is outrageous and convincing as nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his exstripper wife dearly the latter is played abandon conviction and sensitivity all at once courtney love who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination if not of the award itself edward norton plays their jerky lawyer the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox superficially they are immoral outcasts who have had it coming woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down and courtney dies of aids gods damnation but in the powerful love they have for each other each standing the other in turn the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still moralist and in the american context christian if they can love and care and feel just like anyone else on personal level friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism ridding himself of all moralchristian influences go beyond good and evil this is great picture no doubt and love it personally because it is moving funny ends open american optimism blah blah but like it and admire it because it comes from fine american tradition that dares raise difficult questions and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities this movie is not so much about larry flynt but about americans and american society,1.0

deep rising is one of those movies the kind of movie serves no purpose except entertain us it does not ask us think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god screw that it says boldly let us see some computer generated monsters rip into decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos bunch of little known actors heh them wacky monsters gotta love em of course since we can rent about thousand movies the same kind of story must give that little extra oumph get people in theaters that is where deep rising fails is good thing confused let me explain despite all them flashy effects and big explosions deep rising is still at heart good ol movie luckily it is very good movie the worst cliches in movie history are b movies bread and butter therefore things that would destroy serious movie actually help us have good time while watching movie of lower calibre of course we know there is big slimy creature behind that door that one person will wander off be picked off said monster and we always know persons or person will make it out alive we just do not know when or how horrible it will be went see deep rising my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high imagine my surprise when discover that deep rising is actually well pretty darn funny at times funny movie well that is new these flicks are not supposed make us laugh except for few unintended laughs once while and before you know it treat williams wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen hey know them guys and gal from couple of other movies cool familiar faces so far so good our man treat is the hero he will live wes is staple of movies he is the token victim we know he will buy the farm but he will take few creeps him on the way out famke is the babe nuff said there is also guy glasses the guy glasses always dies black person movie buffs know that the black guy always dies never fails and very funny nerdy guy ah comic relief how can we possibly explain having kill him let him live after the first fifteen minutes felt right at home know who root for and who need boo too and gum chew please kill me suffice it say that for the next hour and half jumped out of my seat few times went ewwww about dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing am man we nottice these things all in all would recommend deep rising if you are looking for good time and care leave your brain at the door but bring your sense of humor and excitement in you the acting is decent the effects top rate how best describe it put together the jet ski scene from hard rain the bug attacks from starship troopers couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming do not go there he is behind you and you end up deep rising for creepy crawly goodness tight tshirts major firepower and the need go the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water,1.0

cruise dr bill hardford nicole kidman alice hardford sidney pollack leelee sobieski todd field nick nightingale directed cowritten produced stanley kubrick inspired traumnovelle arthur schnitzer this is an interesting must first off state that you musnt believe any of the rumors of the cruise is not cross dresser kidman does not shoot heroin and there is not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided sex therapist the look of the is suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the was written the translation dream novel makes you thing that the should have been titled dream there is noticable amount of graininess the rather than complain about it as some may and already have see it as style of shooting would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot as much natural light as he could this and the looks like it was pushed another two stops add more grain and brighten it slightly as an auteur and stickler for details kubrick seemed be bit lax on this one the looks great but there are good deal of bloopersflubs that occur you see lots of boom shots in reflection and you see the camera at least twice months for this wow reflection is the biggest killer for this their apartment and almost everything in the casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these some quite glaringly one more topic of heated discussion saw the austin powers version and be perfectly frank unless you know where the overlays are supposed be you will probably not see them two girls standing next each other look little suspicious but can wait for the unrated version on video see it the way it is supposed be spoilers below the itself starts cruise bill and kidman alice getting ready for little xmas soiree they go

is possibly in danger and the woman that warned him has died am trying save bit of the here it is worth sitting through get this point this is only about minutes at this point this is strange because despite the events that occur the has strong family message behind it it will be hard pidgeonhole this as certain kind of it is got sex in it it has nudity drugs and many more immoralistic values but they all serve show why they are bad in ones life recommend this highly on many merits cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than minutes after the opening scene and the secrecy that shrouded the should hopefully be apparent as why it was kept once you see it for yourself,1.0

swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed both children and adults steven spielberg may not have directed he only executive produced but his touch certainly is evident in this movie and he knows money making winner when he sees one the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of blockbuster big action funny comedy and the pacing of rollercoaster hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro fighter for the people he is eventually captured don rafael montero stuart wilson who also unintentionally kills his wife the cuts twenty years later where vega still wants montero dead however he is far too old now and trains up thief alejandro murrieta banderas become the new zorro banderas motive avenge the death of his brother who was killed at the hands of captain love matthew letscher who rather tastefully keeps the head in jar in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie the scene set the movie goes on full blast sword fights aplenty and witty one liners banderas and hopkins have marvellous chemistry as the two zorros playing each other off ease hopkins seems come off little better but banderas does some excellent work as the bad guys wilson and letscher seem one dimensional but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way the audience does hate them cannot be bad catherine zetajones also pops up as hopkins daughter and although she provides little more than the usual female lead she delivers charming but one note performance the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones there is delightful little scene where banderas and jones have sword fight and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed until jones clothes fall off all together the director fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye handles the perfectly the action is well done and fast paced the comedy put across well the cast help lot but the direction is still outstanding although the is very long the plot keeps chugging along and there is barely dull moment however the is little over indulgent and it could have been trimmed it manages hold the attention thankfully and the adventure and charm holds right up the last reel screenwriters john eskow ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script although they have bought zorro up date big explosions and wild action the plot itself is barely existent there is lots of little sub plots hanging around but there is nothing substantial bring them all together the main story seems be the fact that rafael wants buy california using gold stolen from the guy he is buying the land off this sets up for temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines however this does not seem appear until nearly over hour into the so the is never quite sure where it is going in the end however zorro provides action and comedy in spades it suitable for everyone so put the guilt behind and put some more money into spielbergs bank account you will not regret it,1.0
rebel without cause is such an important in american history because it is true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate everyone feels that they are different in some way that they do not belong in some places and rebel without cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions no matter what generation you belong these feelings are present this is why james dean is admired america because in this he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute in our minds we just try do the right thing just like deans jim stark does not only does rebel without cause display these universal emotions for all relate but it also shows that america has suffered uniqe pattern in its social structure each generation looks at its past generation without strong connection this is because times change and in response people change no matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in different light this is why stark and his friends never could form strong relationship their parents even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this in one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out appear that kids are no good and should be ignored this scene shows that what was once cool in past generation is the complete opposite in another speaking on behalf of my generation feel that dean has lost lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown the only ones who seem still lionize him are those members of his generation same goes for brando redford even deniro can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten any that sparks this kind of thought is certainly milestone in american even if rebel without cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking him for couple hours it still is fabulous the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool now however the coolness is fading,1.0
david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible some of them tend be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience look at the in less superficial manner than the plot seems require in order discern its concealed message or sometimes even concealed storyline and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right oh and it is rated incidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided adapt someone elses work namely play terrence rattigan set in the th century he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow rich aging man who finds out that his year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing shilling postal note did you do it he asks his boy no father did not ronnie answers that is enough for arthur who his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts crusade bring his sons case court they enlist the help of sir robert morton notorious attorney help them achieve that formidably daunting task it all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century but arthur is determined keep his familys word clean and he is willing go quite far make sure of that soon enough sir robert morton along the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings so do we all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able make tense but this is not mamets norm and it is refreshing see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were nigel hawthornes performance is nearly flawless his delivery is that of dignified yet not pompous man who seems be getting beaten at his own game we pity the man but we also like him rebecca pidgeon david mamets wife who gave fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthurs oldest daughter flailing feminist who gives her all the winslow case as way for making up for her lack of success in the womens suffrage movement the winslow boy is wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants make real impact rather than phony one be honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like time kill if you wanted but did not this is movie for you it is the epitome of subtlety it is powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying be depressing david mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is hell of director too he is almost national treasure his films deserve their own genre eugene novikov,1.0

when casting the key part of the voice of moses most peoples first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer the saint and the island of dr moreau but he was dreamworkss choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt the selection of kilmer proved be wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took was not in the casting department the radical departure was that they decided use the medium of animation make biblical epic la cecil demille move our hearts and minds rather than tickle our funny bones in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted make for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies now that is something fresh let me admit upfront that was quite skeptical as whether dreamworks could pull it off dreamworkss antz seemed be movie not quite appropriate for any age group the prince of egypt may be harder market than antz but it is much more satisfying like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixars bugs life the prince of egpyt has half of doing the voices danny glover is the voice of jethro jeff goldblum of aaron steve martin of hotep helen mirren of the queen michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god the movie is weakest in the story department is cliffs notes version of demilles the ten commandments the script kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession touching briefly on every classic event in mosess life demille took over three and half hours in order do it justice at less than half of that the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it does not establish sufficient depth for us bond the characters we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket we watch him grow up and become best bud and chariot racing partner ramses ralph fiennes the future pharaoh moses is free spirit and practical joker until he finds out his true identity as jew all have ever known be true is lie moses complains after finding out his real identity he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him after leaving egypt moses comes back ask ramses let mosess people go this leads the classic scene of the parting of the red sea is one of many places where computers were used enhance the traditionally handdrawn animation of the most of the production it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling drawn rich palette of luxurious roses blues and golds the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame its last the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust and other scenes are shot the glow of rising sun the most original visual sequence in the occurs during dream moses has done an explicit twodimensional look the colorful images painted on the temple walls come life tell their own animated story even though it has its weaknesses the prince of egypt is noble attempt carve out new genre serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family this aweinspiring movie deserves be seen the prince of egypt runs about it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family how old kid would need be be interested depends on the child but those over will probably like it,1.0
it is certainly more than just monster story kenneth branagh directoractorcowriter of mary shelleys frankenstein kenneth branaghs new motion picture had compete all the previous frankensteinfilms made throughout the years in almost every part of the world including the most controversial version of them all directed james whale the dark and stormy nights the lightning bolts the charnel houses of spare body parts the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful but the center of the quieter and more thoughtful contains the real story horrorfans will probably be disappointed the total lack of horror branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues morality philosophy and human elements of the story and not on old fashioned horror cliches his version is much closer the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel the begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean the year is bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters his gole is reach the north pole at all costs as the ice closes around his ship figure appears on the horizon it is man exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew his name is victor frankenstein kenneth branagh and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown the myserious stranger begins his tale or more precisely his confession in geneva he is remembering his childhood and youth laughter banquets and parties happy life without troubles or concerns here victor lived his father ian holm mother cherie lunghi his surrogate sister helena boham carter and his servants in happiness and harmony this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed like thunder from quite sky his mother dies giving birth his youngest brother shocked baffled and then gradually changed grief and despair victor already interested in science becomes obsessed death standing on his mothers grave he says oh mother you did not have die no one should ever die will stop this promiss after proposing marridge his surrogate sister and promising return as soon as his studies are finished victor travels ingolstadt in presuite of medical career after while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night creating life from death composing dead bodies frankenstein wanted create the perfect man both physically and mentally strong electrical impulses he managed breeth life into his creation the result was ugliness realizing what he has done frankenstein tried undo his work but it was late the creature has escaped because of the epidemic frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned his home making plans for the wedding for while everything is as it was before his mothers death but then one one his loved once are dying mysteriously whales picture although powerful never managed capture the total depth of the novel brannagh has more or less done that another thing is characters and actors branagh has developed every character and assembled magnificent cast the greatest performances comes from de niro the monster that has been played among others charles ogle karloff lon chaney bela lugosi glenn strange christopher lee fred gwynne as herman munster and now robert de niro alone hated and feared he is completely aware of his ugliness at first he is like helpless abandoned child desperately reaching out for love later when he reads frankensteins journal and learns that he is composed of dead bodies his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge he is capable of killing without regret took him the throughout and lifted him off the ground and then slowly crushed his neck and as killed him saw your face that is how he reveals his savage nature his creator and yet he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable for the sympathy of one living being would make peace all rarely has cinematic interpretation of the daemon approached the level of threedimensionality and humanity it is portrayed in the novel another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein in most of the previous adaptions he was simply mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates monster god knows why the power of an electrical storm almost no time was granted on his charecter who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel here branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein establishes his obsession the very nature of life and death sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment and somehow manages build up rousing and horrifying creation scene branagh plays frankenstein remarkable understanding of his character on the outside he is strong ambitious and talented scientist but deep down he is unsecure fragile and vaulerble constantly haunted the ghosts from his past helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankensteins surrogate sister who at the end becomes his wife for little while before death drives them apart the rest of the cast playing secondary characters is solid and nothing less than convincing visually the is stunning especially the makeup the spinning camera the constantly buildingup musical acore the art direction the production design the costumes are all magnificent from the arctic ocean the swiss alps and dark forests the plagueriddled streets of ingolstadt mary shelleys frankenstein is wonder behold kenneth branagh directs his as if the script was written shakespeare all once loved lies in shallow grave my hand and the ends exacly as hamlet when the creature sets both his and his creators body on fire the ends frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness and terrifying last closeup on the creatures smiling face can man create life then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him whom are its actions then attributable the creature or the being who brought about its existence shelley did not answer these questions but she certainly posed them following her example branagh does the same his is tragic saga about playing god victor frankenstein is not an evil man he wanted change the world the better in this he represents everything science stands for acting without doubts never considering the consequences of his actions produced francis ford coppola frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous dracula in comparison can say that dracula has visuals that even frankenstein can not live up but when it comes story characters and casting frankenstein is stronger but stronger than both of them on every aspect is neil jordans interview the vampire although the is not perfect the camera that simply refuses stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective these minor faults are easily forgivable as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating branagh has probably created one of the best if not the best adaptions of shellys classic novel,1.0
love is the devil is challenging munundating its audience wild imagery and plot structure that disallows plot perhaps in an attempt get us know the artists psyche rather than the artists lifeline watching it was enthralled the look of the the way the director shot everything like it was looking through bizarre personalized filter everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the films subject looked at it personally but while was engrossed stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the awakened from my trance some inner distraction and began try and follow what is going on exactly what was looking at watching this was not sure if it was the most insightful had ever seen or the most vacuous directed and written john maybury love is the devil is stylish masterpiece for the senses everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing the camera angles are ferociously askew and the closeups are uncomfortably too close the editing is deft occasionally cutting away something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding on shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed be voyeurs or rather intruders bacons world and psyche as such there is no real story have not heard much about francis bacon that did not read prior the but what learned was this he was painter in england who reached his peak during the and drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like he was one of the first really come out of the closet and in interviews he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty as played great shakesperean actor derek jacobi he is like foppish and selfabsorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero he lives life the way he wants live it the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close him it is as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself champagne for my real friends and pain for my sham friends he says one night at the bar he frequents love is the devil chronicles the latter part of his life bacon wellknown in his midlife awakens one night when he hears man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor he walks in unafraid of what he finds and discovers thief george dyer daniel craig bacon gives him an offer if he spends the night him he can take anything he wants in the morning george agrees this and off bed he goes but ends up staying him for whatever reason the shows their lives together at least in reference one another while creating bacons world of friends like high art this minors in showing certain group of people who radiate connection that is not shown but is understood the shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant bacon is haughty and bizarre george is simple and does not understand bacon in the least especially not his paintings while watching this that is basically all thought was there the has hypnotic feel free of any restraints of form and is shot so uniquely that felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this was made rather than what it is about once the is over it is easier piece it together kept on thinking about this wondering what the point all of it was someone does not merely make of all style and no substance at all and if they do they do it accident but still allow some substance creep in thinking about it remembered how the two fed off of eachother thought about how bacon was masochist in love cruelty in one scene he watches boxing match orgiastic delight and lets out squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxers head splashes across his face in another scene he masturbates the odessa steps sequence of eisensteins battleship potemkin and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain he drove him over the edge and for him that was love even if it was not for george guess that explains the title bit that is great and all but almost wish the was devoid of any meaning wish it had not reduced itself making some point about humanity about how love is the most selfish thing in the world and it is if you look at it certain way or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one that was truly inside one mans twisted pysche it is almost always best obtain insights from looking at one mans uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audiences throat that way you do not reduce your something it is just not cannot say totally enjoyed love is the devil though despite all of the things respect about this movie it is still rather uncomfortable sit through even at normally trite length of ninety minutes the still seems like an arduous task sit through especially after an exhausting first hour though hypnotic it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times as if it were taking advantage of one mans truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper it as such respect the way the looks it is beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that along what dreams may come and dark city it is the years most visually stunning in fact if better script had been forged would almost compare it in visual power peter greenaway complete similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever and dymanite performance derek jacobi it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs just wish it had been more than mostly style and just hair bit of substance then would have had something hold me over even now,1.0
a costume drama set in the england elizabeth is lush romantic political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of protestant queen from respected catholic one when the court and country are whole after the passing of the queens the royal family so speak are upset that protestant should be crowened and not another catholic plus the new queen elizabeth cate blanchette was the bastard baby of the previous queen marys father the persecution over catholics and protestants is not the only majority in elizabeth elizabeth must face the decision give up personal pleasures and her lover joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love in order rule successfully the country she did for more years both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era and both feature queen elizabeth judi dench plays her in love or course yet found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love not just because elizabeth features great deal more of elizabeth but because found blanchette more powerful hypnotic sense for the role elizabeth also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough is my pick for the best picture of award it is dynamic important breathtaking of loyalty power greed and trust shakespeare would die for the book rights,1.0

one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel that concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century however the big granddaddy of time travels g wells novel the time machine was not written the intention speculate about that concept or its consequences the author g wells merely used it as convenient way express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour whatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed his political messages instead they were fascinated the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers use it as inspiration first of them was george pal who in directed would through the years become genre classic of its own the plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way travel through the fourth dimension time at the eve of the new th century george gathers his friends in order present them his invention machine that would enable him travel through time they are skeptical but that does not prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future at first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars finally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease witness wars and senseless destructions when he finally reaches year ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of unseen machines but weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was brilliant way for the authors talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times for g wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined the negative references war throughout the movie even the modern audience would be tempted discard the as oldfashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era compared the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as good example how make intelligent thoughtprovoking films of course since this is product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness for example it is hard imagine that someone would be able understand perfect english million years in future same is morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today some of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing but on the other hand the is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely oldfashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture the acting is good rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as georges trusted friend filby yvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more her looks than the complexity of her role however despite all those flaws the time machine is very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality sciencefiction films sorely miss these days,1.0

saving private ryan dreamworks running time hours minutes starring tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore and matt damon directed steven spielberg already being hailed as the greatest war movie ever made saving private ryan is an harrowing saddening and riveting movie it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion but it is certainly one of the best war movies made and one of the best of tom hanks stars as captain who is troop has find private ryan damon who has ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action action drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france find him after the disappointing amistad spielberg has returned form this excellent movie am not the war movie genre biggest fan but found this be gripping and very scary thanks the excellent cast direction and terrifying battle scenes tom hanks is superb straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles such as in forrest gump this time he plays the role gritty realism and is much better for it occasionally he overacts the sentimentally but he generally delivers fine performance edward burns looking lot like armageddons ben affleck also delivers top notch performance moving away from his roles in films such as she is the one tom sizemore makes less of an impact but is still watchable and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today spielberg directs very well putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes and what battle scenes they are they are truly terrifying yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen the battle scenes are filmed jerky handheld camera and the panic and confusion felt the soldiers is emphasized this technique the gore and violence is not spared either body parts flying and blood spurting this is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults other factors help saving private ryan be masterpiece of making the cinematography is excellent and the music score john williams is also superb it is never intrusive and adds the drama onscreen but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan there is one major flaw that detracts the genius of the the writing it is unusually flat many of the speeches strangely weak the never really makes any profound statements this is not major gripe as private ryan is of action not words still the script could of been lot better thankfully the actors help partly rectify the situation their great delivery of their lines saving private ryan in the end is an excellent but not the greatest war movie due it is weak acting this should be viewed everyone who has the stomach for it as it is rewarding and extremely worthwhile it really should not be missed and dreamworks skg has finally found it is first hit movie,1.0

sometimes find th century british costume dramas little hard relate it is not the time or the distance it is the rules and conventions of social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy yet somehow the movies are all well made and always get caught up in the story the wings of the dove fits the pattern kate helena bonham carter and merton linus roache are in love merton newspaper writer would like marry kate but kates job if you will is be member of the british upper class her father lost all of her familys money but wealthy aunt agreed take care of her until she married nice rich man naturally newspaper writers wages do not count as rich kate leads him on but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder ultimately because he is not marriageable kates american friend millie alison elliot stops in for visit on her way venice at party millie catches glimpse of merton and likes what she sees kate realizes that if merton were introduced millie he might forget about her it appears that she is trying spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it he is still in love kate and will accept no substitute the three of them along fourth friend elizabeth mcgovern end up on holiday in venice together where their interactions are quite complicated let us sum up millie has fallen for merton merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love kate kate loves him but cannot marry him so on the one hand she is trying match him up someone who will make him happy but on the other hand she is jealous of them as couple clear solution presents itself kate when she realizes that millie is very sick dying in fact at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies millie will leave her money merton who will then be rich enough marry kate she lets merton know of her schemes and since it will help him win kate he reluctantly agrees kate leaves venice so that the two ms can be alone together merton finds that pretending love millie is lot like actually loving her he is not sure he can separate the two kate finds that she is not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love and marrying anyone else the brilliant scheme proves be painful all involved without revealing the details suffice it say that the situation ends badly the title refers the object of mertons vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament one is left feelings of regret and despair what started as such promising relationship was damaged greed anger and jealousy an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of noir couple conspires cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive the other and after few things go wrong the whole idea seems like an awful liferuining mistake would not call the wings of the dove noir but the comparison is interesting as have acknowledged before am not wonderful judge of acting but liked the performances from roache and elliot roache successfully conveyed his characters ambivalence toward millie near the end he hugs her at first staring into space as if he is thinking about his plan kate then giving that up fully embrace millie millies part did not require as much range but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same lowtraffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion their settings are far removed from my personal experience geographically historically and socially still the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over,1.0

in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon in other words it is decent couple of hours of entertainment but years from now if they compile list of mel gibsons greatest hits payback probably will not be on it gibson plays crook who gets double crossed his partner after they heist payroll mels partner needed the money pay off mob debt so he puts couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on pay off his creditors but mel is not dead it would be real short movie if he was and he certainly is not happy make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing go any lengths accomplish this feat his ex partner has already used it pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob get it back payback is often very violent its credit there are few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director am not sure one more about that in second made the choice let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us the usual gratuitous gore found in many films the appears bit disjointed in places is understandable considering producer star gibson was not thrilled how the turned out and wanted parts of it reshot when the director refused another one was brought in do the reshoot so as result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally would love see the original version for comparisons sake it does get bit of choppy feel it towards the end it is always tough make where the main character is villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities in this case gibsons character has few redeeming qualities but hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive gibson is gibson whether he is playing suicidal cop or stone cold killer he does good job he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going get one good performance this time out mel is surrounded good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses the man who steals the show and unfortunately does not have real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster if had one big disappointment in this it would be that coburn did not have bigger role in the end payback is fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibsons other work,1.0
the thoughtprovoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of leila powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in prosperous thirtyyear career gain s distribution thanks first run features although unfamiliar mehrjuis previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood all viewers set in modernday iran leila begins on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after brief prologue in we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa as leila and reza set off visit his parents and then hers where birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life is not quite as sweet earlier on that very same day leila had gone see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving child when all of the conditions are ruled out and leila passes up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her and does not care at all about having children nonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able give him baby is the societal norm and her selfesteem is not helped at all her domineering motherinlaw jamileh sheikhi whose hopes carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son bluntly explaining leila that reza has always wished for children and in country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take second wife bear child leila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet woman whom he claims like even though he refuses go through the marriage if leila does not give her full blessing there are no easy answers be found within leila that thoughtfully examines the central characters unfortunate plight as well as the inner workings of leila herself told through matteroffact narration almost completely taken over her own shame she has no option but agree her forceful motherinlaws requests even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman maybe because leila is from iran the will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences since the concept of polygamy is looked upon the characters as more or less everyday occurrence leila however is unable come terms the idea quite as easily but feels it is her duty make her husband happy no matter what the circumstances one of the strongest aspects of the is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply it is this relationship that is the key ingredient making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible although seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another ditto for another scene in reza gives leila large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals beautiful necklace he has also gotten her these small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences in the latter half in reza drops leila off at the side of busy road and then zooms off go on date another woman left there ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able keep her husband herself for little while longer refusing stay over at her parents house the inevitably leads up the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below despite her initial agreement such thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed reza whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him sure the whole second marriage was his mothers idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children then he could have still easily backed out could not he in the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair unlike most american films in everything always has be spelled out for audiences hatami says much more just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed words every bit perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa as reza man who believe does hold an unbreakable bond his wife but is too naive realize what he will be doing leila if he marries someone else for all of its strong aspects leila is not perfect on technical level found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need be fixed and concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared everything that has come before mehrjuis decision use an extremely stylized approach the ending was the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw played memorably jamileh sheikhi despite these minor missteps leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may release at new yorks cinema village and then on may in la the thoughtprovoking questions that the deals is balanced evenly its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away reveal victim led into complete devastation there is no return it is difficult not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other characters taken second out of their own selfish lives consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme was going

it is an interesting premise our reality is only real us because it is what we perceive be real in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly our brains what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than computergenerated construct interlinked the minds of others through vastly powerful artificial intelligence our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for dominating order of machines control the planet the scifi realm has been waiting little while for something new come along the matrix is not it the idea of war between man and sentient computer network sham world the ability plug ones brain into computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and few star trek episodes both classic and next generation what is new is the ability weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking keanu reeves plays computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines the groups leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined lead the attack against the artificial intelligence from the beginning of the we are kept on our toes trying figure things out this in lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun what is reality what is sham the turns our very perception of life on its side more than once we are also presented the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live life of relative bliss oblivious the true nature of our surroundings as viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo and who better play bewildered person than keanu reeves reeves whom have never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles require lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety he was good in speed for example but laughably poor in walk in the clouds neo is actually one of those roles reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught in couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is heavy credit writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski mean since bill and teds excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves more interesting than reeves is fishburne who is morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so very surprising for scifi movie fishburne also maintains certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what expect this helps further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge hugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs is also good playing his deadpan nononsense kick ass role requires him show emotion at the appropriate time unfortunately when weaving speaks for more than few sentences in row the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes little more laughable than impressive carrieanne moss plays trinity morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of love interest for neo although her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne is not in the picture there were few expenses spared when it comes the special effects many methods of imagery are employed from modeling bluescreen computer graphics of special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from new angle this is accomplished using large number of still cameras employed in semicircle motion picture cameras placed at the two ends the motion cameras the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once place each still image in sequence and you get nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera the second pretty slick the matrix drips style from the clothing the music the action we are watching an exaggerated version of what we are used much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action there is lot of kung fu there is lot of gunplay when character is letting go an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling the floor in slow motion there is also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects combined it is really like no liveaction have ever seen the is not without its faults some of the scenes and ideas are borrowed little too liberally from other films and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing some of the lines are also pretty bad in one instance supporting character incorrectly delivers famous saying and it was not meant be joke however these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi that for once does more than merely entertain,1.0
